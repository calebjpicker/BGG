						               													<description>Flawed TCG is the world&amp;rsquo;s most customizable trading card game! Traditional card board cards are sleeved together with clear essence overlays, giving you complete control over how your deck plays in-game. With almost 7,000 possible combinations in set 1 alone, Flawed brings the most diverse gaming experience to the TCG genre.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game of Flawed is meant to represent a single battle between two warring factions. Players will represent one of six factions by choosing a Shrine to defend. These Shrines are important locations to each respective faction. In a single skirmish, the player who is able to destroy the enemy Shrine is victorious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share turns and alternate actions which creates a unique, engaging play experience. Not only do you customize the cards while building your deck, in game, every card can be played as its base version or used as a resource. So play patterns are very dynamic and player autonomy remains a major focus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set in a low fantasy world, filled with lore including unique Epic Characters and cards. Much of the design is story driven and the themes and mechanics are built to reinforce these motifs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
