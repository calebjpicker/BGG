						               													<description>Jesus Christ has promised us that he will be returning, and as a follower of Christ we know that this is true. But what about the people that don't know? Jesus gave us our great commission to go into all the corners of the world and share the gospel, and that is exactly what we will do. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your character cards will be your friends, your family and your fellow church members, each with their own set of unique skills and encouragements. When a coal is separate from the fire, it grows cold. Keep great people around you and your faith will grow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will also have support, in the form of churches, bible studies, small groups and even education. These support cards will stay in play and give you greater opportunities to travel and spread out across the world. But the mission field starts right at home, will you witness to your neighbor or to a total stranger?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You may travel across the entire globe on mission trips. Some may be only for a single turn (think of it as a youth group trip to the Ukraine or Mexico) and some may take over the rest of the game (such as settling a family in another country, or becoming a pastor for a military branch overseas). Wherever you go, you will always have people to witness to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The win condition. Sharing Christ's love is not a race, and cannot be kept track of via face down prizes or a life total. So we create a new card type, the Mission card. Therefore go into all of the world, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. Each player will have at least one Mission card within their deck, and when you have met your requirements listed on the mission card, you can reveal it to your opponent. The first player to finish their mission does not automatically win however, as the game is not a race. Instead, each Mission has an assigned point value based on its difficulty, and when one player runs out of cards in their deck, whoever has more Mission points wins that game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Don't think for a moment that lower point values are easy and high point values are hard, remember the woman who gave two coins? Her gifts to the Father were greater than those of the rich men.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
