						               													<description>Players move around a map of Europe, scoring points for each destination they reach. Card play determines destination, transportation method, and distance traveled. Players may play hazard cards to block or slow down their opponents. One of the players is the assassin and scores bonus points by getting a &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; on one of the other players. Game length is variable: when a weapon card is drawn by a player, it is placed on the map. When the fourth weapon card is drawn, the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is a revised version of EuroHit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[Below descriptive text from the box back]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Assassination has been the tool of the desperate and the ruthless seeking change since time immemorial.  The course of mankind's bloody history has taken many a turn due to the assassin's bullet.  Any successful leader--whether criminal, business scientific religious or political--can suddenly become a target in these modern days.  The assassin strikes without warning, at the least expected time from the last expected quarter.  Be he professional or amateur, the assassin's primary weapon is his ability to blend with his background, to be &amp;quot;one of the crowd&amp;quot;.  It is his skill at doing so that enables him, like the hunter in the wild, to surprise and kill his quarry.  Unbeknownst to you, the world's greatest assassin could be your brother or sister, your spouse, your child or parent, or your friend seated beside you.  Perhaps you yourself are the next &amp;quot;Jackal&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is a challenging card/board game for 3-6 players, aged ten and up.  Played against the backdrop of modern Europe, players travel about the board, scoring points for visiting as many cities as possible.  But beware, for some unknown reason one among the players is an &amp;quot;Assassin&amp;quot;, who scores even more points by making a &amp;quot;Hit&amp;quot; when in the same city as another.  Perhaps the intercession of an &amp;quot;Interpol Officer&amp;quot; might save you; perhaps not.  Perhaps an &amp;quot;Espionage Agent&amp;quot; will alert you to who among the players is the threat; perhaps not.  Perhaps the assassin will hit an &amp;quot;Innocent Bystander&amp;quot; instead of you' perhaps not.  And the players never know when the turn of the next card in the deck will bring the game to an end.  Like our fast-paced world, the action in ASSASSIN is furious and challenging, with just a hint of uncertainty and danger to add spice to the intoxicating mix.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blessed with colorful and eye-catching artwork, Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is both educational and entertaining.  Playable in under 90 minutes, it is the perfect game for social gatherings.  The rules are easily mastered, and included numerous options to make the strategy more or less challenging, and playing time shorter or longer.  The play can e lighthearted and friendly, or ruthlessly competitive, the rules allow for either, depending upon the style of play and the desires of your group.  So, if you are ready to face the challenge of touring Europe while a killer stalks your heels, shuffle the cards and sit down to play ASSASSIN.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A fast-moving fun game for 3 to 6 friends to play in an evening!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
