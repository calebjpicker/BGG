						               													<description>Trains are the pinnacle of transportation across the country. Start your train line, and compete with others as you try to get a juicy government grant to expand your business. It's not going to be an easy trip with bandits lying in wait, couplings coming loose, and other locomotives trying to claim the grant for themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns taking one action: get deliveries, cargo, or caboose (end game goals) cards, discard specific cargo cards to make deliveries, or upgrade their locomotive (flipping it over) to increase their hand limit. When making deliveries, players will place their completed delivery(s) behind their locomotive card. There are also special cargo cards which adds some &amp;quot;Take-That&amp;quot; into the game allowing players to play the Bandit and steal from each other, or protect themselves from Bandits by playing the Marshal. While the Loose Coupler causes you to lose one of your cargo from your hand, the Wild Cargo card acts as any cargo from any location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Not only does Deliveries on Track feature both a standard and advanced mode of the game to challenge both younger and older players, it also has a unique game mode which allows players to choose which version of the game they'd like to play at the same time, creating a Mixed mode with minimal gameplay changes to the younger players. There's minimal text on cards, relying primarily on icons and drawings allowing younger players to be able to play with little issue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The end game is triggered when a player has at least 5 completed deliveries. All other players have one last turn. After, all players are able to put up to two completed caboose cards on their train. The winner is the player with the most deliveries including caboose card bonuses in Standard and Mixed modes, or the player with the most points including caboose card bonuses in Advanced mode.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
