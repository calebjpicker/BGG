						               													<description>Part of a three in one game system, MAG-Wars is a magnetic spaceship, battling game for 2 players (or 4 with an extra copy and a large tabletop).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In MAG-Wars, players choose either miners or raiders and build a small skirmish unit of ships with which to battle each other (based on the encounter&amp;rsquo;s points value and theme).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the battle can begin, the environment must be set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of the three games in this overall, magnet based system, both MAG-Wars and MAG-Miners will use a procedurally generated system to make sure each arrangement of asteroids and space debris is completely unique.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the environment has been set, players will each draw three hidden objective cards and battle will commence:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.Players line up their ships on opposing table edges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.To decide who goes first, both players choose one of their ships and simultaneously flick them across the table.&amp;#10;The player who flicks closest to their opponents side of the table without going off is the winner and goes first.&amp;#10;Note: There will be practice mini games available in MAG-Skills (the third game in this system) which will help players perfect their flicking power and accuracy.&amp;#10;3. The first player flicks all of their ships once.&amp;#10;4. The second player then flicks all of their ships once.&amp;#10;5. Play continues like this with each player only being able to flick their mobile ships (right way up).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beyond flicking to move, spaceships in MAG-Wars can do a number of different things. Here is a list of some of the potential actions that can be declared during a battle:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A. Attack - You can flick a ship at an enemy and if it makes contact, that enemy ship loses power and is immobilised (placed with its tail end down on the table).&amp;#10;B. Assist - If you have an immobilised ship on the table, you may declare assist, rotate that ship to the angle required and then flick a ship at it to try and knock it back down (power it up). If successful, that ship may be flicked this turn as normal (chaining multiple assist flicks can potentially power your entire team back up in one turn).&amp;#10;C. Repair - Some ships need only make contact with a powered down ship to be able to power it back up and get it flicking again.&amp;#10;D. Dock - Certain ships have the ability to dock with other ships. If this is declared and the flick successfully makes contact with an appropriate target (varies per ship), then the two become docked together.&amp;#10;A docked ship can be:&amp;#10;- Towed to its enemy&amp;rsquo;s portal and captured (removing it from the game),&amp;#10;- Boarded and looted,&amp;#10;- Did I mention these ships TRANSFORM!!!&amp;#10;Well actually they can be combined together in various different combinations. Should a player declare &amp;lsquo;dock&amp;rsquo; and then make contact to the appropriate ship, the two ship models can be temporarily combined to form a &amp;lsquo;Hyper Ship&amp;rsquo; with a very powerful and unique ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win the game you must either:&amp;#10;Knock/have all your opponent&amp;rsquo;s ships immobilised,&amp;#10;Fulfill all three of your hidden objective cards,&amp;#10;Have the highest total ore value when all ore has been collected.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
