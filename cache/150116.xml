						               													<description>The images and story for the game include the most famous tight rope walker of the time, Blondin.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Charles Blondin is famous for first walking across Niagara Falls Gorge on a tight rope in 1859.  He would later walk across numerous other times and entertain the crowds by crossing blindfolded, on stilts, or with his manager on his back.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game board shows an amusing scene with a tight rope stretched across a river flowing down from a waterfall. Directions for the game state &amp;lsquo;Ben&amp;rsquo;, who stands on the cliff dressed in the sailor suit has already crossed safely.  The four walkers still attempting to get to the other side by way of the rope are named Ez, Uncle Tom, Fatty Fisk, and &amp;lsquo;the expert Blondin&amp;rsquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board also shows people falling from the tight rope and landing in the water below.  These are named in the directions too.  Ebenezer is tumbling into the water, only Nebuchasnezzar&amp;rsquo;s feet are shown as he sinks below the water, Ezekiel is swimming to shore, and Jeremiah is said to be going up the ladder.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The boat in the scene is named as well.  Commanded by Uncle Sam and carrying a small African-American boy, the boat represents the Freedmen&amp;rsquo;s Bureau.  This agency was created in 1865 to help the newly freed slaves.  With the tight rope bridging the gap, and the dangers of failing, the game is seen to give subtle references to the post civil war era.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tight Rope is played by the spinning the indicator (earlier edition - rolling the two dice).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To step on the rope (place his piece on space 1), a player must spin a 1.  To move across to number 12, a player must then spin the next number to where his piece rests.  This is done by spinning two times in a row.  If a player does not spin the number needed to move his piece one step ahead, the player then moves down the grid.  Whenever he spin the number needed (no matter how far down the grid he is), he moves to the number near the rope.  If the player does not spin the needed number and is in the last space below his numbered step, he moves back one step.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player across wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
