						               													<description>Khans of Tarkir is a Magic: The Gathering block consisting of Khans of Tarkir (September 26, 2014), Fate Reforged (January 23, 2015), and Dragons of Tarkir (March 27, 2015). The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia. It is the last block to have three expansion sets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The plane of Tarkir was once dominated by dragons, but in a massive war over a thousand years ago, humans succeeded at wiping them out. Today Tarkir is a battle-torn realm where five clans feud for supremacy. As presented in Khans of Tarkir, the five clans focus on &amp;quot;wedges&amp;quot;, or sets of three colors that are rooted in two colors and one &amp;quot;enemy&amp;quot; color across from it. Each wedge is the colors of a clan of warriors that venerate a certain quality of the dragon, and an anatomical feature that represents it. The clans also make use of the &amp;quot;Morph&amp;quot; mechanic, returning from the Onslaught block, which allows creatures to be cast face-down as 2/2 creatures and turned right-side up for additional cost, and occasionally additional benefit; this magic is described as being an invention of the extinct dragons, now adapted to human needs. The clans, and their khans, are as follows:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Abzan Houses (White, Black, Green) see endurance as the most important quality of the dragon, and use the scale to show that. Their mechanic is &amp;quot;Outlast,&amp;quot; which allows them to permanently strengthen themselves by tapping. The clan is led by Anafenza, called &amp;quot;The Foremost,&amp;quot; known for leading from the front.&amp;#10;The Jeskai Way (Blue, Red, White) prefer the cunning nature of the dragon, and represent themselves with the eye. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Narset, the Enlightened Master who speaks of other worlds than Tarkir alone. Their mechanic is &amp;quot;Prowess,&amp;quot; which gives creatures temporary bonuses every time the player casts a non-creature spell.&amp;#10;The Sultai Brood (Black, Green, Blue) make themselves ruthless like the dragon, and see the fang as its most ruthless part. Their mechanic is &amp;quot;Delve,&amp;quot; which allows the player to lessen the mana costs of spells by exiling cards from the graveyard. They are led by Sidisi, Brood Tyrant, a powerful naga necromancer who considers herself queen of the clan.&amp;#10;The Mardu Horde (Red, White, Black) views speed as the greatest aspect, and use the wings to represent that. Their mechanic is &amp;quot;Raid,&amp;quot; which provides bonuses if the player attacked this turn. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Zurgo Helmsmasher, a savage orc who has a vendetta against Sarkhan Vol.&amp;#10;The Temur Frontier (Green, Blue, Red) believe in the dragon's savagery, and use the claw as their symbol. Their mechanic is &amp;quot;Ferocious,&amp;quot; which provides bonuses if the player controls at least one creature with 4 power or greater. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Surrak Dragonclaw, a mighty man renowned for punching a bear.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
