						               													<description>Yggdrasill A game for 2 players set up in Nordic setting and based on Nordic mythology, where one side (good gods of Asgard and vikings) try to eliminate the bad guys (evil gods and monsters) by defeating a giant snake Jormungard living in the crown of the Yggdrasill tree.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the beginning, the good side can play only with 12 vikings, who are not too powerful. Their task is to send the message to the gods of Asgard to ask them for help in the war with evil forces. They can do it by either building the ships and sailing to Asgard, or by killing one of evil monsters (Trwyth), after which, they will be allowed to go through the stone forest and reach Asgard. Evil side, of course, tries to prevent it from happening, but with slick tactics, vikings are able to achieve it. And this is when the real fun begins. With the help of almost 20 gods, the good side begins an even battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The evil gods and monsters try to chase and eliminate the good gods and vikings, to prevent them from reaching Yggdrasill. the tree on which Jormungard the snake lives. If the good manage to kill it,they win. If the evil, eliminate all good ones, they win.&amp;#10; Every character in the game has 2 traits: strength and magic power + some of them, are able to use spells. Duels are, unfortunately simple, you choose either strength or magic, roll a die and add the result to the chosen trait. The higher result denotes the winner. After the 1st wounded the character's token is flipped and remains wounded until healed (successful die roll)or attacked and wounded again, which is the end for a given character.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played on a huge board, divided into lands. There are seas, rivers, mountains, forests and places to explore, where magic items can be found. Characters can also learn spells in magic schools.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are also event cards, drawn at the beginning of a new round.&amp;#10;The game, though simple, and rather visually not too attractive, is a lot of fun to play. Because of the size of the board and numerous charters, it is never played the same way. The good may have many possible routes to get to Yggdrasill, and the abilities (spells) of some of their mightiest gods, can change a hopeless situation.&amp;#10;If one changed the rules of battling, made a new colorful board and substitute cardboard tokens with plastic figures, the game would be a hit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
