						               													<description>From the Publisher's website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Announcing Ultra-Quick Tennis!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;My goal in designing this game was to develop a mechanism to quickly play through a tennis tournament. With other tennis games, either the game took too long to realistically complete a full tournament, or the game was too simplistic and produced far too many upsets. As with all of my games, I wanted a quick playing design that closely mirrored reality in the tennis world. The end result is a game that I&amp;acute;m very proud of.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ultra-Quick Tennis has been thoroughly tested for statistical accuracy. I am extremely confident that the formulas employed in the game accurately represent each player. To make it a game, I&amp;acute;ve added some elements of chance, as well as some rare play results. Overall, I think you&amp;acute;ll find the winners to be on par with what you would reasonably expect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ultra Quick Tennis includes over 300 professional men from the 2005 ATP Tour and well over 400 professional women from the 2005 WTA Tour. Also included are the full schedules for both Tours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are accurately rated for each playing surface found on the respective Tours. You'll experience the sheer dominance of Roger Federer on grass. Clay court specialists like Guillermo Coria will shine at Roland Garros, but prove to be mortal on the hard courts at the US Open. Every player will realistically perform as they did in actual tennis competition during the 2005 campaign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All of the unusual events that can happen in tennis like injuries, retirements, loss of concentration, arguing line calls all happen in Ultra Quick Tennis as well. The ball is in your court, purchase Ultra Quick Tennis today!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
