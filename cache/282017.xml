						               													<description>Stock Market&amp;ndash; stock exchange board game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- a business world strategy game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- large, rollable gaming mat, easy to care&amp;#10;- new way to play: no dice needed (option)&amp;#10;If they believe, they&amp;rsquo;ve see everything in the field of financial strategy games, here comes absolutely revolutionary way to play. Realistic, easy to play, but not too simple. Stock Exchange business is not that easy in real life also. No need for paper or other memo materials. Playing could be just as intensive and stress loaded as real life stock broker life, while waiting for the profits to come and still everything could collapse in a moment.&amp;#10;The game suits best for the advanced players over 10 years old. It&amp;rsquo;s a demanding product for those, who likes to dive into parallel universe of game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Idea&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;Stock Market is a reality game following the rules of stock exchange world, where assets increase is mostimportant. In this game the Players are both: brokers and investors. The Bank sells tokens used forinvesting. As in real stock market, the idea is to buy low and sell high. The rates change every turn, eachPlayers can make one or multiplied exchanges on own turn. Dice can be used to play, but usually StockMarket is played with finger marks, that determine the rate vectors. The duration of one game can bedefined by players, e.g. 40 or 60 min. The person to make most of their capital within the agreed timebrackets is the winner.ATTENTION: Dramatic turns in the body of the game can cause stress symptoms when taken too seriously.It was our goal to make this game as real as possible following stock exchange ups and lows dramas.Anyway, this is a virtual reality only. Relax and enjoy!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Play&amp;#10;To begin:Roll open Lite Lion Games rollable Stock market gaming mat. Place violet rate detectors to the mid-space, marked &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo;. At least two players are recommended to be on the opposite side of eachother/other side of the table to make the finger marks drawing easier. The Players choose own colourfrom the four colours available. Each Player gets 5 pcs tokens of the corresponding colour, each ofnominal value of LL$400 of investment, and LL$2320 cash. The cash money is issued as following: 1 pcsLL$1000, 6 pcs LL$100, 9 pcs LL$50, 9 pcs LL$20 and 9 pcs LL$10. The investment tokens can beexchanged to cash in the Bank as equal to LL$400 each.The beginner can be chosen in any suitable way, as coin draw and etc. In according to the sequence ofturns, each Player has equal amount of turns per game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Turn&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Rate:For each turn two Players draw the number. The number is counted together on fingers of two Playersat once: The Player, whose turn in on and any other Player as agreed. The hand is hidden behind theback or under the table and when released, the amount 0-5 can be shown on fingers (as pictured). Thegross number on both Players&amp;rsquo; hands valued 1-10 is the number of the share to move. It can go up or&amp;#10;&amp;#10;down. The violet indicator is moved one step up to down to show the quote of the particular share.The position of the palm is important: if both Players&amp;rsquo; palm is facing down, the rate decreases, otherwisethe rate increases. If both Players shows zero, the rate of each share 1-10 decreases one level. If bothPlayers show same even number, the vector of each even number share (2,4,6,8,10) is moved one step.If both Players show same odd number, the vector of each odd number share (1,3,5,7,9) is moved onestep.ATTENTION: Step and Level enjoy different relevancy. Step is one space on the rate indicator vector,when Level is a grade on the vertical vector.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Changing the Rates with Dice:The Player of the upcoming turn throws one of dice first. Numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 increase the Rate by onestep. Numbers 1 and 2 decrease the Rate by one step. Then the Players throw two dice. The grossnumber is the number of the Share, which goes up or down. The violet Rate Indicator is moved one stepforward or back. If dice return gross number 12, all the Shares 2-11 decrease one level. If both dicereturn with same even number, the vector of each even number Share (2,4,6,8,10) is moved one step. .If both dice return with same odd number, the vector of each odd number Share (1,3,5,7,9) is movedone step.ATTENTION: Step and Level enjoy different relevancy. Step is one space on the rate indicator vector,when Level is a grade on the vertical vector. When played with dice,Shares are marked with numbers 2-11, so Share #1 equals with number11 on dice. Dice gross number 12 is equal to zero on fingers. Otherwisethe instructions are same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Quotation changes:Quotation changes after each Trade (buy/sell) event except the firstinvestment round. As the Asset is invested, the Quotation Indicator ismoved a step forward. As the Asset is released (the Shares are sold out),the quotation indicator moves a step back. The changes take place afterthe trade event is completed. The quotation always moves one stepdespite the value of the trade event. The Quotation Indicator moves asillustrated considering steps 1-7. The horizontal step does not changethe rate. When moving downwards, the Indicator moves same, but inthe opposite direction. When Rate Level changes, the Indicator goes over green or red line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Exchange:As Exchange Rate changes, the Player completes the Trade. Each Turn allows to make multiple Trades(Buy/Sell Events). The Player invests one or more Units into the chosen Enterprise. One non-recurringinvestment nominal value is $400.&amp;#10;Investment Purchase Rate:&amp;#10;If the Rate Indicator is in zero space (&amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo;), the Investment is in its nominal value of $400. &amp;#10;If the RateIndicator is e.g. +20, the Investor has to pay $400+$20=$420&amp;hellip;..&amp;#10;If the Rate is e.g. -60, the Investment is $60 below the nominal value, so they can get a $60 refund from the Bank or buy the shares for $400-$60=$340.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Investment token is placed to the same space with the Rate Indicator.Investment Sales Rate&amp;#239;&amp;#129;&amp;#182; ProfitIf the Investment Token is in e.g. in space &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; (zero) and Rate Indicator is in space &amp;ldquo;+40&amp;rdquo;, the Investmentis evaluated $400+$40. So, the Investor gets $40 profit. NOTE: When selling shares out, the investedsum is not refunded to the Bank but stays in the possession of the Investor (the Player). The Investorgets interest from the Bank $40 for each invested unit. (?)&amp;#239;&amp;#129;&amp;#182; Lost&amp;#10;If the Investment token is in space &amp;ldquo;-20&amp;rdquo; and the Rate is &amp;ldquo;-60&amp;rdquo;, the Player&amp;rsquo;s Investment is $40 below purchase price, so when selling, the Investor has to pay $40 to the Bank for each Invested Unit. So, the Player gains a loss of $40. The Investment token returns to its nominal value of $400 after this action.Exchange commissionThe Exchange charges a commission for each assignment. Each Investment Unit placed into Shares isdue to the brokerage of $10.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rate Development&amp;#10;Top Rate&amp;#10;Reaching its top value, the Rate development stops. Getting a raise claim, while enjoying the top rateposition, the Rate collapse three levels down, e.g. from level +120 to level +60.&amp;#10;Bottom Rate&amp;#10;Reaching its bottom value, the Rate development gets out of control. Getting a reduce claim, whileenjoying the bottom rate position, the Share turns valueless and all the Investment have to be returnedto the Bank without reimbursement. This action forces the Rate back to zero level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trades Between Investors&amp;#10;The Players are allowed to trade Shares/Investments between each other. The trades occur accordingthe Rate levels. Reciprocal trading is not due to commissions, neither it influences the Rate. The buyerplaces their Investment token instead of the Seller&amp;acute;s ones, and the Seller&amp;rsquo;s tokens are returned to theBank. The Bank does not pay for the tokens as they are paid by the Buyer. The price can be also agreedin-between the parties, as in some cases singular Investor for particular Share is an advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Winner&amp;#10;The game is over when the agreed time period is full. As the Investments are liquidated, the Player who gains the biggest capital is the winner. The game is also over, if every Share&amp;rsquo;s Rate is in its top value. Thiscondition also enforces Investments&amp;rsquo; liquidation.DurationDuration of one game round is subject to the number of Players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
