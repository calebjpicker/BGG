Brent Ward&amp;#10;Developer: Barry Kendall&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Red Menace is a solitaire wargame pitting the strategic nuclear and defensive forces of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom against those of the Soviet Union and its client state, Cuba, in 1959. The game focuses primarily on the role of strategic bombers, but other types of supporting aircraft such as Interceptors, Airborne Early Warning aircraft, and Aerial Refueling Tankers are also represented.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The term &amp;quot;Red Menace&amp;quot; was used during the Cold War by the U.S. because it was believed that thousands of Soviet bombers could be unleashed at a moment's notice. This turned out not to be true as the Soviets had several hundred bombers at best, and many had significant range limitations. The game is not meant to be an accurate simulation of the actual capabilities of the strategic forces involved, but rather reflects what the governments and citizens of the U.S., Canada, and the UK believed could happen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn consists of fifteen phases played in order from drawing random events, deploying and moving Soviet flights, intercepting flights, submarine operations and more. Reference sheets are included to make tracking the game progress easier. Decisions for the Soviet units are made by the game system using random events and dice. The player simply moves the Soviet bombers towards their assigned targets. Scenarios are included with various starting positions, targets, and actions for Soviet, United States, and United Kingdom bombers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game complexity is easy, but optional rules are included to make it more challenging. The winner of a scenario is determined by the points scored from attacking the opponent's cities. Points are awarded by a random chit draw after each successful attack. A typical scenario requires fifty points to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
