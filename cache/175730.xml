						               													<description>You control a group of survivors, trying to reclaim the city from the infected. But who do you fear most? The infected or the Surviving?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game in a nutshell. You control a group of survivors, not just one ninja of the apocalypse. You control your team to try and take back as much of the city before the infection ends. &amp;#10;Then you can reign as king over the post-apocalyptic city. So how do you do this?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, each survivor has one action which can be spent on either &amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Moving &amp;ndash; moving one hex &amp;#10;    Reclaiming the building &amp;ndash; Boarding up the windows so it is safe again and you can lay down your flag to claim your victory points &amp;#10;    Searching rooms &amp;ndash; Each building has a set number of rooms you can search. What will you find, supplies? Survivors? Or the dreaded 10 zombie card!&amp;#10;    And if on a park (farm) tile, then you can farm &amp;ndash; One survivor can choose to spend an action point to farm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Farming? I hear you ask, well in the game once you have reclaimed a park, it is used to produce food. You can spend food at the start of your turn to give 3 survivor 2 action points that turn making them &amp;ldquo;well fed and ready for zombie carnage&amp;rdquo; However you can actively farm a park tile, spending a survivors action point. &amp;#10;This means that at the start of your next turn that farm produces 2 food instead of 1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can end in 4 ways: &amp;#10;The research centre is reclaimed (the cure has been found and the outbreak is over) &amp;#10;The military base is reclaimed (More guns than any one army could need, you are left with a city flooded with zombie soup) &amp;#10;When a group of survivors has reclaimed and spends one turn actively farming 5 farms (who needs to worry about zombies when you have fresh veg and steak every day) &amp;#10;Or finally if one player reaches 50 Victory points before any of the other conditions are met&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However it is the player with the most Victory points that reigns king. So be careful before you cure the infection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory Points&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So what is worth victory points: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Buildings - worth the number of victory points indicated by the yellow number in the top right corner. &amp;#10;    Survivors &amp;ndash; worth 1 victory point each &amp;#10;    When the game ends every 2 supplies card is worth 1 Victory point&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What else can you use supplies for? &amp;#10;Throughout the game you can trade in 2 of your supplies to give one survivor: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Armour &amp;ndash; decrease an attackers dice roll by one &amp;#10;    Weapon &amp;ndash; Increase one of your attacking die rolls by one&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Or you can build a wall. A wall will stop zombies and must be destroyed by attacking survivors before they can pass.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat in Surviving is simple. Survivors attack first. You roll a die for each survivor. Each die roll of 4,5 or 6 kills a zombie. Then any zombies left roll a die each to attack the survivors. A zombie must roll a 5 or 6 to kill a survivor. &amp;#10;Repeat until all zombies are dead or all survivors are dead or have run away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;That is it. Simple rules so if someone hasn&amp;rsquo;t played before they can jump in and within one or two goes they are as clued in as everyone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
