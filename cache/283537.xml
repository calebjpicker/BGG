						               													<description>Discovery Duels is set in the &amp;quot;Rise of the Occulites&amp;quot; universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a two player mini game that takes about 10 to 15 minutes to play. It places you as one of Darwin's two kids trying to discover the most about the different Occulite Tribes over the holidays, before you have to go back to school.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal: Be the one to discover the most about the Occulite Tribes by having the most Discovery Points after six rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Play: &amp;#10;5 cards with different occulite tribes are placed in a row in numberical order (1 to 5).&amp;#10;Each player rolls their five dice. Players count to five while looking at what their opponent has rolled and then secretly order their own dice in a line behind their hand. This determines which card each die will be allocated to. The first die in the line will be allocated to the firest card and so on. The first player to finish allocating dice will break ties during the round. &amp;#10;After both players have finished ordering their dice, they are revealed and then placed on the card they were allocated to. Each card is then resolved in order (1 to 5), paying attention to the rules that are written on the card. When  one  player  has  a  higher  end  total  for  a  card  than  the  other player, they are said to DISCOVER the card and receive a number of Discovery Points equal to the number on the card.&amp;#10;Players play six rounds in the way described above, totalling  their Discovery Points across all six rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
