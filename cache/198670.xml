						               													<description>Since ancient times, the world has been ravaged by war. The wise foresee an age of horror approaching, for the spirit of the earth is sick, tainted by deadly sorcery in a great conflict ages past. Not that the warlords of this bloody era care, not while there is glory to be won, territory to be wrested from the enemy, foes to be slaughtered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kings of War 2nd Edition is a hardback rulebook that contains the complete Kings of War history and rules. It features:&amp;#10;- Rules written by Alessio Cavatore (Warhammer 40,000, Bolt Action) and the Mantic Rules Committee. Kings of War is a game for gamers, by gamers.&amp;#10;- Compelling new background, art and photography that invoke a powerful realm of swords and sorcery.&amp;#10;- Elegant easy-to-learn rules, balanced and playtested by the community for casual and tournament play.&amp;#10;- New Magic Spells and Artefacts&amp;#10;- Eleven Force Lists upgraded with new units, including Forces of the Abyss, Forces of Nature, Undead, Dwarfs, Elves, Abyssal Dwarfs, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Basileans and the Kingdoms of Men.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kings of War is the miniatures wargame from Mantic Games. Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &amp;mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And that&amp;rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&amp;rsquo;ve ever played before.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2012, the &amp;quot;beta&amp;quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for many factions are also available for download. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdom of Men (Medieval Humans), Basileans (Clerical army with saints and angels), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes.&amp;#10;An expansion includes the complete Ogre army list, while additional faction lists are now available in the &amp;quot;Uncharted Empires&amp;quot; supplement: The Brotherhood, Salamander (humanoid lizards) Armies, The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undeads... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
