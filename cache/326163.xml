The &amp;ldquo;Summoner&amp;rdquo; draws one card from the cards and makes it his or her own hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(2) Magic value calculation&amp;#10;Each player multiply the total points of Ms cards in their hand with the numbers of players. And that is each player's magic value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Start the &amp;ldquo;Magic value amplification&amp;rdquo; with the player who has the highest magic value starts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(3) Magic value amplification&amp;#10;The player who rolls three dice and multiplies the total points of the dice by the magic value to determine the &amp;ldquo;Final magic value&amp;rdquo;.
