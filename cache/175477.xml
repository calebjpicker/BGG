						               													<description>A Gentleman's Game Of Cannibalism&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take on the role of wealthy victorian era socialites and compete through braggadocious storytelling to determine who is the most interesting person. The only problem is that when money is no object what could you possibly wager with? Well winning a hand in Samuel Sandwich may be more literal than you might think.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Samuel Sandwich is designed for 2 to 4 players&amp;#10;The game consists of cards, playmats, counters and coins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is dealt a hand of &amp;ldquo;doings &amp;amp; deeds&amp;rdquo; cards each of theses cards has a selection of color coded words which are used to construct a story. These cards also contain a custom Samuel Sandwich suit and a point value so that at the end of each round your point total can be determined.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the round a &amp;ldquo;consorts &amp;amp; cohorts&amp;rdquo; card is flipped to reveal a famous historical figure. This person will be the subject of everyone&amp;rsquo;s  story as they try to outplay each other. There are 2 wagering rounds one when the &amp;ldquo;consorts &amp;amp; cohorts&amp;rdquo; card is revealed and then again when players select and place the cards they will be using face down on the table.&amp;#10;after wagering is resolved players take turns revealing and telling their story to the group. After everyone has told their tall tale the points are added up and the winner takes the money bet during this round as well as all cards played during the round (minus their own).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Feeling hungry?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning A Hand&amp;#10;After winning a round a player may then select one part of another player to eat. The correct counter is removed from that persons player mat and is placed in the stomach of the round winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trading In&amp;#10;Players may also trade in 10 doings and deeds cards they have won from other players to select an additional part to eat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Selling Off&amp;#10;If a player finds themselves low on funds at any time in the game they may sell off a part to the highest bidder in order to replenish their financial stockpile to continue wagering.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game the player who has eaten the most is declared the winner. &amp;#10;The key to success is not what you eat, it&amp;rsquo;s who you eat and how much!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
