						               													<description>Each player in turn throws a number die and moves along his line of advance by the number thrown until he reaches the middle space 13. This space can only be reached if the corresponding number of free spaces is rolled. If, on the other hand, the player has thrown more eyes than there are spaces up to 13, he must wait until he rolls the right number. The player now has the right to roll two number dice and the movement die immediately after his last roll.&amp;#10;The player advances or retreats to the number that results from the calculation of the symbols and numbers on the three dice.&amp;#10;During the game, the play money regulations indicated at the edge of the game board apply.&amp;#10;If a figure hits a space occupied by the other player, it is moved back by one space.&amp;#10;From the spaces of numbers 76 to 91 you only play with the two number dice, from the number 92 to the end only with one number die. The number 100 can only be reached in the same way as the number 13.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
