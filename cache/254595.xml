						               													<description>Get Elected is a card game for 3 to 8 players (ages 16 and up) where you have your presidential candidate attend funny campaign events, hold silly fundraisers to earn money and popularity, make outrageous promises, play scandals on your opponents (because it's always fun to trip up the other candidates), avoid the scandals yourself by spinning the news, participate in some debates, and win states.  Once your candidate has earned the electoral points (states) needed to win, then you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's easy to learn, hilarious to play, fast-paced, more fun than the actual elections, and without long-term consequences!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here's how you actually play the game:&amp;#10;After rolling the dice to see who goes first, in turn order everyone selects a Candidate.  Each Candidate comes with its own unique special ability.  Everyone gets starting money, 3 Event cards, and 3 Situation cards.  Players (in turn order) draw a State Card to see which they will be competing for that turn.&amp;#10;Your Candidate will collect a campaign salary for the turn.&amp;#10;You will then draw an Event card and a Situation card from the decks.  Now you can play as many Event and Situation cards from your hand as you want:  some are useful playing on yourself, others are fun to use to mess with the other Candidates.  Your goal here is to earn money and popularity points.  The more you have, the better the chance to win the State at the end of your turn.  After all of the card play, everyone competes for the State.  To win the State (and its electoral points), you roll the die, add in your popularity tokens to the roll, and subtract any negative points from Scandal cards that other players may have dropped on you.  The player with the highest net total wins that State.  Game play proceeds like this until one Candidate has enough electoral points to win the game.  (The number of points needed to win is determined by how many players are in the game.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's straightforward and easy to play - a typical game of 4-5 players taking about an hour.  This game never bogs down, doesn't require political knowledge, does not take any political stances, and is not designed as an educational game about politics. This is a fun little game about winning by accumulating points and messing with your opponents to prevent them from doing the same!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
