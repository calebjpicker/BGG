						               													<description>Everyone's a suspect when murder is on the menu. And with a Classic Detective Murder Mystery you have everything you need to serve up the perfect murder dinner party. First the invites, you choose which of your friends play which devious suspect and invite them to come along as that character. Then the shopping list, menu suggestions and recipes. Plus of course...a really tasty murder to solve. It will be drop dead fun, and by the end of the evening, one (or more) of the suspects, your 'friends', will be caught out as the murderer!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's 1919 and the world is still reeling from the shock of the Russian Revolution. For those inside the country, the political upheavals are matched by personal tragedies, and nowhere are this truer than within the Russian royal family. The Tsar, his wife and children have all been killed, and the surviving royals are anxious to escape the same fate. Which is why they are now sailing into exile on board the British warship the HMS Winston.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But even here, it seems, no one is safe. On the second night of their voyage a stowaway is discovered on board. He's found face-down in one of the lifeboats, and he has a jewel-encrusted dagger stuck in is back. Who is this mystery man? Who killed him? And what does any of this have to do with the assassination three years earlier of the mad mystic, Rasputin?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The suspects are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Dowager Empress Marie &amp;ndash; The mother of the murdered Tsar and the great matriarch of European royalty, she is reluctant to leave Mother Russia for the first, and maybe the last, time.&amp;#10;     Prince Felix Youssoupov &amp;ndash; The playboy prince whose behaviour scandalised St Petersburg and is most famous for being the man who killed Rasputin.&amp;#10;     Princess Ivana Legova &amp;ndash; A niece of the Tsar, she is reputed to be the richest woman in Europe, particularly since the death of her financier husband.&amp;#10;     Grand Duke Boris Borisovich &amp;ndash; One of the great landowners of Russia, though the source of his wealth is still something of a mystery.&amp;#10;     Captain Pretty &amp;ndash; The naval officer in command of HMS Winston is very young for such a position, but he has a distinguished war record and is expected to rise high in the service.&amp;#10;     Martha Harry &amp;ndash; An American journalist who has been covering the Revolution for the Washington Fox and now seems in something of a hurry to leave the country.&amp;#10;     Charles Bronstein &amp;ndash; With mixed American and Russian parentage, he has been brought along to act as translator between the royals and the naval officers.&amp;#10;     Jane bond &amp;ndash; An Englishwoman who was employed as a nanny for the Tsar&amp;rsquo;s daughters and is now accepted as almost part of the family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
