						               													<description>&amp;quot;Brrr, it's cold...&amp;quot; - this was your first thought when you blinked and looked around. The very previous moment, as you remembered, you and your daughter were at home, drinking hot&amp;#10;chocolate wearing your ugly Christmas sweaters, staring at the snowfall through the window, and waiting for the clock to hit midnight as usual on 30th November. But now, everything seemed so... frosty and strange.&amp;#10;- What on earth just happened? - your daughter asked, but before you could answer...&amp;#10;- Hello! - You heard from behind... What? A speaking snowman?&amp;#10;- Would you like some hot tea? You two look tired. - he said cheerfully.&amp;#10;And then quickly added: - You can pay with snow! - he smiled widely.&amp;#10;- Whoah, pay with... snow? - You were unable to hide your surprise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players are wandering in a magical winter land, and their most important quest is to find a way home. In order to do that they have to help some peculiar locals with their tiny little problems while looking for the magic snowglobe as well, which will be able to send them home when they finally reach the Christmas tree. The players start their journey in front of a snowman's hut, where the adventure begins, exploring objects and mysterious piles of snow, finding useful tools, and winding up in all kinds of challenging situations. Meanwhile, it is snowing continuously, which sometimes might be helpful, but other times it blocks their way. As time goes by, the weather gets drearier and drearier, fog and immense snowdrifts could close off the players' paths. Time passes differently in this unusual world, too. Ten minutes here is a whole day in the real world, so they must hurry with their mission to get home by Christmas Eve. At least that's what the snowman in the hut said, and I really hope he was right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
