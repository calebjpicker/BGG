						               													<description>Ogleis is a dying planet whose surface is covered with a thick layer of ice, in the subsoil remains an extremely hostile biome immersed in the darkness or survival is pushed back into these last entrenches. This planet has only a rare source of energy the phospho-substance and one resource: the mutagen which is the main nutrient and a powerful vector of mutations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Glow in the darkness is a game halfway between the wargame card driven and the 4x, it's also a semi-cooperative horror game. Players start the game with 12 units, 3 source cities and 7 action cards. Dynamic gameplay: during its turn of play the player makes 2 actions chosen from a variable choice of programmed action&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players embody evolved alien entities whose race is on the verge of extinction. Each player leads one of the 4 alien factions that try to guarantee their survival by plundering the genetic material (material token) of the opposing factions. The first player to acquire 4 material tokens wins the game. At the beginning of the game, the abilities of each faction are symmetrical (which also makes it easier to understand the game).  Each player develops his own faction's abilities during the game based on his strategy of adapting and his playing affinities, the game then takes on a highly asymmetrical twist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must conquer energy Source-cities, manage their energetic and opposing networks in order to increase their power. Players must also move their units carefully to guard against hostile reactions from the fauna and flora.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Glow in the darkness has mechanisms and a unique gameplay including:&amp;#10;- a common semi-hidden deckbuilding for the improvement of factions&amp;#10;- a common action system with semi-hidden orders (which favors manipulation between players)&amp;#10;- a controlled &amp;quot;action anomaly&amp;quot;promoting bold strategies&amp;#10;- the morphe system for the specialization of faction capabilities&amp;#10;- a sequential combat resolution system  &amp;#10;- a biome with an autonomous and interactive evolution, including a mechanism of procedural generation associated with a comparative and adaptive mechanism of fauna and flora.&amp;#10;- major evolution of the scary game (based on recent scientific studies concerning: fear)&amp;#10;- the original and subtle management of resources through the construction of energy networks&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game for 2-4 players 14+ years old.
