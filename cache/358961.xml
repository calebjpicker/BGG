						               													<description>Leader's Idol is a table game with character development elements. The number of players is 2-4. The player will be in the position of the public relations manager of the Leaders Company and will carry out PR activities for the company. This PR plan includes making subordinates public relations idols, and it is important for players how to make their idols active.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The outcome of the game is determined by the total number of PR points earned at the end of the game. PR points are listed for each public relations plan (project card) that is the center of the progress of the game, and these cards can be obtained by &amp;quot;auction&amp;quot;. There are 24 types of projects, and the points and contents are different, but a &amp;quot;budget&amp;quot; is required to compete for these, and the speed at which these budgets can be recovered depends on the abilities of each idol. If you spend a lot of time collecting your budget, no matter how big a project you get, you may lose to another company that has more projects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, some projects may have synergistic effects with other projects, and some may affect subsequent activities. For example, the &amp;quot;manner training&amp;quot; card has 0 PR points, but it has the effect of improving the &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; ability. Therefore, planning is important for how to use the budget, and it is also necessary to consider when to incorporate training such as compensating for the weaknesses of the character / developing the strengths.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, some projects may have synergistic effects with other projects, and some may affect subsequent activities.
