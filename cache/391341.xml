						               													<description>Working as a monster in an evil wizard's dungeon isn't easy. It's dark, damp, and your boss has a habit of turning employees into frogs during annual performance reviews.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But perhaps the worst thing is the boredom. Sure, it's exciting when the occasional hero stumbles past and you have a bit of a scuffle. However, most of the time you're just hanging about watching mould grow on the walls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Deep in the depths of Hoodez Dungeon, Toothache the Troll and Gumrot the Goblin became fed up of sitting around doing nothing. Borrowing the jaws of a nearby skeleton (asking politely first, of course) and some gems they found in a treasure chest, they invented a fun new game of teeth collecting which made the hours between battling adventurers just fly by.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Battle Dentale, you play either Gumrot the Goblin or Toothache the Troll, competing to collect the best collection of teeth from a jawbone. Toothache favors the cleaner teeth because they're shiny, while Gumrot likes the decaying ones as the smell reminds them of their mum. Winning requires strategy, efficient decision-making, and sometimes evil moves to sabotage your opponent! To win, gather a more highly valued collection of teeth than the other player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
