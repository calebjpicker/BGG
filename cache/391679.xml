						               													<description>&amp;quot;RouYouJin&amp;quot; is a fairy tale-themed game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, in explaining the features of &amp;quot;RouYouJin&amp;quot;, let's explain the outline of the play of this game, not the text of the 9 types of villager cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First of all, the goal of the game is to increase the number of victory points and have the most. Victory points are sheep or gold.&amp;#10;1 sheep is 1 point, 1 gold is also 1 point, but if 1 sheep is converted to gold, it will be doubled to 2 gold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set the order card and the villager card and put them out on the back.&amp;#10;First, turn only the order cards into a table and arrange them so that the number on the left is small and the number on the right is large.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rightmost villager in the row becomes a wolf.&amp;#10;Villager cards other than wolf are turned face up.&amp;#10;The number of society is written on the villager card, and if it is greater than or equal to the number of society on the left villager card and less than or equal to the number of society on the right villager card, the villager card is in the correct position.&amp;#10;Villagers in the correct row will trigger effects based on their role.&amp;#10;Some villagers have text effects even if they are not in the correct position.&amp;#10;As a result, you can collect sheep that are victory points, convert sheep into gold, or steal other people's sheep.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win the game, your villagers must be in the correct position in the line.&amp;#10;It requires a high degree of reading on your part and a bit of luck.&amp;#10;The reason is that you need to combine the order card in your hand and the three villager cards well.&amp;#10;Aim for the front of the line, or for the back, or whether your plan will succeed... it's all up to you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;That said, it's basically an orthodox card game.&amp;#10;It is almost impossible to get lost in the play itself!&amp;#10;The slightly complicated rules and the short playing time of about 20 minutes will give you the joy of playing a dense game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, although it is basically an interpersonal battle with 4 to 5 people, it is fully equipped with rules for 1 to 3 people including automatons. Therefore, it is a game that is not easily influenced by the number of players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
