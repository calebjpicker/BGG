						               													<description>In this Wild West town the stakes are high as every last one of you worthless lawbreakers are WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE for reckless and criminal behavior and are fugitives on the run. You must navigate the dangerous streets surrounding the Courthouse in order gather your posse together, escape capture and rule the town. Your posse of fugitives will attempt to round up reluctant and disloyal accomplices&amp;mdash;trying to keep them in tow to accomplish their ill-conceived agendas. Beware, your accomplices can be taken from you at any moment, you may be hauled off to jail or even challenged to a duel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Wild West in 1879 was ripe with lawlessness. But in the vast Arizona wilderness the town of Prescott grew even wilder. A row of saloons cropped up and took over an entire street. They coined it &amp;quot;Whiskey Row.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After much drinking and gambling, reckless and criminal behavior ensued. The townsfolk dueled it out with their six shooters on the dusty streets&amp;mdash;each acting as judge and jury. The souls of those shot in cold blood haunted the town.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With opposing ill-conceived agendas, the townsfolk divided into four renegade posses and all became FUGITIVES of the law.&amp;#10;The unruly CITIZENS,&amp;nbsp;&amp;#10;The dishonest MERCHANTS,&amp;nbsp;&amp;#10;The brutal OUTLAWS&amp;nbsp;&amp;#10;&amp;amp; The corrupt local LAW.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2-8 players each use four real poker chip Wild West characters (their posse) to move around the board by choosing to play one of two 'wanted dead or alive' cards or roll two dice with an option of splitting the dice to move TWO characters. Each player has a posse of four. For instance, the Outlaws have the Gunslinger, the Madame, the Dealer and the Bartender. As they move through the streets of this dangerous town, strategic options are chosen to decide which of your opponents players you choose to force into being your reluctant accomplices by stacking them under your own posse's fugitives&amp;mdash;you will need them to escape the law and win the game. The cards list a group of four wanted fugitives for a particular crime, so you may choose one from your own posse, OR one of your opponents, thereby giving you the chance to move an opponent's fugitive and waylay their attempts to win the game. Duels may be called before each turn in order to steal your opponents accomplices, kidnapping the Marshal or the Judge keeps you protected from capture and sending an opponent to the jailhouse or a haunted property slows down their ability to escape capture.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Although there are at least five strategic choices to choose from during each turn, the game moves along quickly. During another player's turn there is much to think about, so you are engaged the entire time. All players remain in the game until it concludes and there is no clear winner until it pans out in the end&amp;mdash;with one player's posse escaping caputure by returning to their individual hideouts...with the help of their accomplices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
