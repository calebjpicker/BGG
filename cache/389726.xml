						               													<description>PK Eleven is a card game in which two players simulate the penalty kick procedure at the end of a soccer game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has an identical set of 11 cards.  The cards have one half showing the strength and direction a kick is made, and a second half showing the strength and direction the goalie blocks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players lay out their cards in a line and flip the left most one face up. They can peak at their next next. One player is designated to kick first and both players simultaneously point to either their revealed card or the face down one next to it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the kicker kicked in a different direction than the goalie defended, they scored. If the directions were the same, compare the strengths. Then, switch roles and if one player used their face up card, they reveal their leftmost card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Repeat this procedure until the cards are used and the person with the most goals scored is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
