						               													<description>A 2-4 player hand management game about building a flower crown. You have a choice to collect your flowers from two different decks the forest and the meadow. Manage your hand by trading with the corresponding flower stall so you only have to play what you want to play. Play three of the same color flowers into your basket and get one for your crown. Be on the lookout for the unique wild flowers that can be played as any color! Every time a deck is reshuffled a new seasonal wild flower is placed into that deck. The game ends when someone has completed their crown or when the decks have been depleted 4 times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
