						               													<description>Designer Terry Coleman has served up VPG's first ever sports strategy game, TC Tennis. Choose from 24 of the greatest tennis champions in history and pit them against each other in a fun, fast-paced game that isn&amp;rsquo;t packed full of tables and charts. Instead, the entire game is designed to get you thinking about strategy right from the first strike of the ball. Each player in the game is rated for various Strokes such as 1st Serve, Backhand, Forehand Volley and Touch, from a low of F (a terrible shot for a pro player), to AA (one of the legendary Strokes in tennis history). Play Strategy cards to increase your scoring chances, defend against your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Strokes, or try a variety of Tactics (Crowd the Net, Pick up the Pace, etc.) to shake things up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fun comes not only from the wide variety of Strategy cards in play at any particular time, but also from the effects different cards have on each other. Do you risk hitting a Cannonball Serve, knowing that your opponent might have secretly played a card that negates it? Can you keep using Go for the Lines as a Tactic, knowing that you might miss, and hurt your scoring chances? And depending on which players are involved, the strategic decisions each set only multiply. As you master the Basic game and move on to the Intermediate and Advanced games, we add the possibility of a Set ending earlier, more Random Events, Tiebreakers, and even Fatigue and Injuries, for those who want more realism, without much increase in complexity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stage your own tournaments, find out which courts best fit your style, and serve up some of the greatest Strokes the world has ever seen! Will you lead your favorite players to victory?
