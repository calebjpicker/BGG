						               													<description>&amp;quot;Asedio de Baler 1898: El fin de un imperio&amp;quot; is a wargame based on the siege that took place in Baler (Luzon Island, Philippine Islands) between 1898 and 1899. For a period of 337 days (almost one year), the Spanish were sieged by the Katipunan forces (Philippine Revolution). This heroic event would be remembered by both Philippines and Spanish for ages.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game you can choose playing with the Katipunan or Spain. It offers a competitive 2-player mode and a solitaire mode where you could choose between both forces. Both forces are asymmetrical, and the main mechanic is a hybrid between the deck construction and action points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played during 12 rounds maximum (equivalent to 1 month approximately), of 2 impulses o turns each round (one per player). At the beginning of each round an event might take place, it will be indicated in an event card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal for the Katipunan is to break into the church where the Spanish were sieged or construct a system of trenches forming a ring around the church forcing the Spanish to surrender.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal for the Spanish is to maintain the Spanish position in Baler at all cost and resist till the end of round 12. Or succeeding in sending an expedition to Manila with the scope of find out about the real news and current situation since the Spanish were isolated totally.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each impulse or turns the players will play a card to determine initiative. The first player will make all his impulse sequence and then the other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Player will proceed to play cards in hand trying to be as much efficient as possible. These cards can be played to activate or plan different actions. After actions are carried out the strategy phase begins. You can use the points from the cards played for getting new cards to improve your deck, spend those points to perform actions as action points or a combination of both. Finally, all cards are discarded, and the player draw new cards to form a new hand for next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once both players have finished playing theirs impulse the round is over and the maintenance phase will take place before starting a new round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
