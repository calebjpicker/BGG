						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;2 player card game. Simulation of an American Football game ... As in regular football, the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game uses a custom deck of cards made up of seven types of cards: Run, Pass, Kick, Blitz, Offense, Defense, and Special. Cards are played to gain Field Position Tokens which represent the offensive player&amp;rsquo;s position on the field, from the player&amp;rsquo;s goal line (zero tokens), to midfield (three tokens), to a touchdown (seven tokens). Down Tokens are used to track change of possession on downs, which occurs after the Offensive Player accumulates five of the tokens. Whenever the Offensive Player gains a Field Position Token, all but one of the Down Tokens are discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player begins with a hand of five cards, and draws three cards at the start of each turn. The Offensive Player declares whether there will be a regular play, punt, or field goal attempt. The Defensive Player may play a Blitz Card. If the Blitz Card cannot be countered by the Offensive Player, the play is over. If a regular play was declared, the Offensive Player then declares either a running play or a pass play, and plays either a Pass or Run Card. If the card is not countered by the Defensive Player, the Offensive Player can play one additional card to increase the yardage of the play. A Run Card can be used to extend either type of play, but a Pass Card can only be used to extend a Pass play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When an Offensive Player accumulates seven or more Field Position Tokens, a touchdown is scored and the Offensive Player receives six points. The point after touchdown attempt is governed by a die roll, as are punts, field goals, and kick offs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
