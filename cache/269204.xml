						               													<description>ACQUISITIONS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ACQUISITIONS is a game inspired by the ideas of Sid Sackson. It is a game that is predicated upon building a Kingdom of wealth. Long ago, in distant times, Kingdoms were sometimes won and lost by mighty armies. Battles were waged to gain the lands and treasures held within the Kingdom under siege. Yet always behind these mighty armies were the Kings and Queens with their vaults of gold, silver, and bronze. Wealth has always driven the ownership of land. Kingdoms were always built on wealth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game of ACQUISITIONS allows players to wheel, deal, and plan their way to building the largest Kingdom of wealth. The only &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; in the game of ACQUISITIONS is the luck of the draw for the Destination Cards. Beyond that, it is up to the player to purchase, trade, and strategically maneuver to become the King or Queen of the largest cache of Commodity Coins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basic concept of the game of ACQUISITIONS is that the players create and grow Kingdoms by playing the Destination Cards in their hand and placing buildings on the board. The Destination Cards available to the player are provided strictly by the luck of the draw. The skill in the game of Acquisitions, to generate a large amount of Commodity Coins, comes from the ability to obtain Kingdom Cards in the Kingdoms that will grow or even in the Kingdoms that are taken over by larger Kingdoms. The obtaining of Kingdom Cards is generally made in Kingdoms based on the players&amp;rsquo; capability to grow those Kingdoms with their cards on hand. However, players can increase their Commodity Coins by obtaining Kingdom Cards in Kingdoms that grow from the other players building placements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The main objective of Acquisitions is to become the player with the most Commodity Coins at the end of the game. This is achieved by obtaining Kingdom Cards in the Kingdoms that are growing, for a long term venture, while at the same time shrewdly investing in smaller Kingdoms that can be sacrificed in takeovers, for a short term outlay, all of which gains Commodity Coins through Royalty Compensations. The more Commodity Coins that can be generated in short term outlays, the more they can be invested into long term ventures. You can not reach the pinnacle of the game of ACQUISITIONS just by becoming the King or Queen of the largest Kingdom. The player who wants to become the wealthiest King or Queen must produce that perfect mix of active cash flow through takeovers and uncanny investment in Kingdoms that will grow. Many different strategies can be used to reach the pinnacle of wealth because every game is different.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game of ACQUISITIONS will keep the players focused because one purchase, one trade, one placement of a building can be the difference between win or lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Acquire a Kingdom of Wealth&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
