						               													<description>A game for 2-4+ players with a restaurant building theme.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An 8x8 grid represents a city.  There is a set of 64 counters to be placed on the spaces of the board representing 16 districts (of 6 different types) and 48 restaurants (6 each of 8 different types).  A space on the board may only ever contain 1 district or 1 restaurant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start the 16 districts are distributed to the board such that each row gets 2 random districts randomly placed. All restaurant counters are in a pile called the build pile which is shuffled and placed face down next to the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player gets a set of 20 tokens, 10 coins, 4 random restaurant counters and 4 cards from a common card deck. Cards are of three types: Number, Income and Improvement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising has 6 phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.   Investment Phase&amp;#10;-    The active player receives 1 Coin. &amp;#10;-    If you have the most restaurants of a given type (for each type) get one extra coin.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.   Recruit Phase&amp;#10;-    The active player draws 1 card and puts it in his hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3.   Build Phase&amp;#10;-    You may build one restaurant. This costs 10 coins and the restaurant must come from your restaurant pool. &amp;#10;-    When a restaurant is built, draw a replacement counter from the build pile. &amp;#10;-    Place the restaurant counter on an open space on the board with one of your tokens on top of it.  When building a restaurant, you must also discard a number card and the restaurant must be placed on a row or column matching that number. &amp;#10;-    You may not build a restaurant adjacent to another of the same type.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.   Improvement Phase&amp;#10;-    You may play one Improvement card. This costs 5 Coins. &amp;#10;-    Place improvements face up on the table in front of you. &amp;#10;-    You can have a maximum of 5 improvements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5.   Income Phase&amp;#10;-    You must either play an income card or initiate a random income sequence. &amp;#10;-    When playing a restaurant income card all restaurants of that type earn income. &amp;#10;They gain 1 coin for every adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) district.  When playing a district income card all restaurants adjacent to that type of district earn 1 coin each. &amp;#10;All players earn income, not just the active player. &amp;#10;-   To initiate a random income sequence roll 2D8 to get a random space on the board. If that space is a restaurant, that restaurant earns income for each adjacent district. If that space is a district, each adjacent restaurant earns 1 coin. &amp;#10;-   If you have the only restaurants of a given type on the board they gain 1 star.  All restaurants start with a base rating of 1 star.  Certain Improvements and bonuses increase the number of stars. When a restaurant receives income multiply by its star rating to get the number of coins it earns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End Phase&amp;#10;Discard cards in your hand in excess of 4.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends immediately when one of the following happens: &amp;#10;-    Any player runs out of tokens to use.&amp;#10;-    All restaurants of a single type are built.&amp;#10;-    Players go through the deck twice. &amp;#10;The player with the most coins at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
