						               													<description>The Gemstone Collector is a fun quick turn-based card game for 2 to 6 players. In the game, each player tries to be the first to collect 3 gemstone cards of the same kind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts with the deck of cards in the center, face down. Each player takes a turn picking a card from the pile. That card can be a Gem (12 different gems) or a special card (attack, defense, joker card). Depending on the card, the player may wish to use it immediately (e.g. change the gem type they are collecting, add it to their existing collection if it fits, play it against others etc), keep it for later (for non-gem cards only), discard (&amp;quot;burn&amp;quot;) it or put it at the bottom of the pile (&amp;quot;stash&amp;quot;).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when someone collects 3 same gem cards, or if the pile runs out. In the latter case, the winner is determined by the number of gems they have, the number of  attacks they successfully thwarted and/or the number of attacks they didn't block. If all else fails, the winner is determined by the type of gem they were collecting when the pile ran out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One game will typically run for about 10-20 minutes, depending on how fast the players are, and how many players are in the game. It is easy to grasp, fast-paced, with quite a few hints of strategy, but luck also plays some part.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
