						               													<description>You are a group of pirates that have captured a ship loaded with precious booty! Now you must each try and seize the biggest share of the loot. There&amp;rsquo;s just one problem: there&amp;rsquo;s a fire in the gunpowder room! Once the flames reach the powder kegs, the ship will be blown to smithereens and your treasure with it. So grab as much swag as ye can and jump overboard before the ship goes BOOM!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle the cards and place the pile face down in the center of the table, next to the treasure chest filled with coins. There are 29 Coin Cards with a value of 1 to 5 coins, but there are also unpleasant cards in the form of eight Pirate cards and the BOOM! card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All cards are mixed to form a face-down stack and in turn everyone takes their turn and draws a card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every player hopes to draw coins cards, but these will only be paid out when you disembark the ship. When a player draws a Coin Card he keeps it in his hand. On the next turn, he draws another card. But he can also decide to jump overboard! To jump overboard, the player adds up the value of the cards in his hand and collects the same number of coins from the Treasure Chest. He then places his cards on the discard pile and sits out the rest of the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player draws a Pirate card, he executes the action. Examples of this card are taking cards from fellow players or even throwing them overboard. The player will collect the value of his cards in coins and sit out the rest of the round. With the Davy Jones&amp;rsquo; Locker card, you are safe from the next five cards drawn&amp;mdash;you can sit back and relax.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But if the BOOM! card is drawn, all is lost! Players still on board the ship must return all their Coin Cards. No coins are collected (except by the holder of the Davy Jones' Locker card). All players discard their cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The round ends when all players have jumped overboard or the BOOM! card has been drawn. The discard pile is then shuffled and used as the draw pile for the next round. The player that drew the BOOM! card in the last round goes first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when there are no more coins in the Treasure Chest. The player with the most coins wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
