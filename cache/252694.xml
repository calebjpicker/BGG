						               													<description>Friday Night Legends allows you to play historic high school teams of the past with team results based on their actual stats.&amp;#10;Players act as the coach for the chosen team and make decisions as such. Both players select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them simultaneously. The players then look up results on their team sheet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The love of football and passion for football begins for many with high school football. Chris Doelle and Michael Wright encapsulated their passion for American high school football in their exciting vision of the sport in Friday Night Legends. Friday Night Legends (FNL) allows you to play historic high school teams of the past with team results based on their actual stats.  The core of the FNL game engine is based on hours of in-depth and meticulous hours of research.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game system is elegant in its simplicity that allows you to do what you want to do coach and play games with your local gridiron heroes. Players act as the coach for their chosen team and make all the critical decisions like their real life counterparts do. In a matchup between two players, you each simultaneously select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them.  FNL elegance comes from its years of development, using a system of a few simple die rolls and simple math of the addition and subtraction of results when the players look up those results on their respective team sheets.  Team tendencies in terms of their breakdown in running vs. passing plays are tracked on the simple game day pads. The easy to use individual team chart replicates the strengths and weaknesses of each team. FNL's unique and easy to use system enables you to compare and play powerhouse larger schools against the small &amp;quot;Hoosier&amp;quot; type size high schools. The fast playing time of 60-90 minutes both allows you to play more games in short order while still capturing the fun and essence of high school football.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Although FNL started out as Texas High School Football, the game's fans started clamoring for teams of their local teams and FNL has started meeting that need.  The game designers responded with adding more teams across the country and continue to meet that demand from game players with the plans to expand their high school football team universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
