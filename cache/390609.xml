						               													<description>Alarm in Helsinki! The &amp;quot;Great Coffee Safari&amp;quot; is about to begin! A revolutionary new coffee recipe developed by professor T.C. Papu has been stolen by one of the competitor's industrial spies. The thief has escaped abroad and now it's up to the players to follow, trying to find the stolen recipe and collecting four bags of different varieties of coffee beans from around the world (Medellin, Mysore, Kenia, Santos), all of which are required for the coffee mix. There are also several copies of the recipe around; these are worthless however, but only until the original recipe is found, at which point they become just as good for victory purposes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once anyone finds the original coffee recipe, a race back to Helsinki begins, and the player who first returns there with either the original recipe or a copy of it and the required four bags of beans, wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is quite clearly inspired by the most popular Finnish boardgame ever, Afrikan t&amp;#195;&amp;#164;hti, and plays very much like it, with copies of the recipe taking the place of the horseshoe token at the end of the game, for example. Major differences are the deck of event/trivia cards in this game, the lack of &amp;quot;jewels&amp;quot; or similar of lesser value than the Afrikan T&amp;auml;hti (=coffee recipe), and the small set collection element of acquiring the coffee beans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is likely from the 1980's as it's produced by Nelostuote Ky.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
