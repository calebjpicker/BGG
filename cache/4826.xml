						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner. Designed for a women-only setting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BUMP-OFF AT THE BEAUTY SHOP -or- Who Waxed the Highbrow?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Loopey Lady Beauty Shop, located in beautiful Looslypes, Louisiana, invites you to attend the shop's tenth anniversary celebration, a special day indeed, since some said this celebration would never happen. Especially after the beauty shop relocated this year to that old Victorian house in downtown Looslypes, Louisiana, a home once owned by Miss Meara Unkinde, a woman whose deathbed promise was to haunt the beauty shop and wreak havoc on the hair of all who enter there. Plus there has also been mention of some missing jewels, a decades old mystery somehow connected to one of the Loopey Lady's best customers, Kat E. Cauldhart. None-the-less, life goes on at the Loopey Lady. . as does the trimming, teasing, detangling, highlighting, low lighting, perming, and oh, yes . . . let's not forget about the dyeing . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attending the Celebration will be:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faulleen Sizzorze is the lovely and lively owner of the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. A savvy businesswoman who has survived the ups and downs of the Looslypes, Louisiana economy, she's managed to bring her business, as well as her customers' hair, to new heights. Hardworking and headstrong, Faulleen is the queen of customer service, making sure her clients adore their do's. Hairdo's, that is. She dresses in the trendiest of fashions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gilda D. Nailson is the Loopey Lady's manicurist. But she's also an amateur psychic, as well as an aspiring actress who has appeared in the local community theatre's production of Edgar Allen: a Poe-trait of Fright. Giddy, gregarious and grandiose, Gilda is the ultimate glamour girl and simply adores glitz. She wears anything with glitter, sequins or rhinestones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Coco Coiffure is a new girl in town, having moved into the decrepit old DeDaye home, which holds as much dust as it does ill-fated history. Mysterious, moody and often melodramatic, Coco is quick to change the subject when the questions are directed at her. And of course, she's a constant customer at the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. She prefers the clothing of eras gone by.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Barri Bouffant is a beautiful and boisterous benefactor, a woman whose heart is as big as the hairdo atop her head. She is the founder of the Let the Large Lizards Live Society, for which she hosts a charity ball at her own mansion every year. Bubbly and bodacious, Barri is partial to anything big, including big jewelry, big dresses, big handbags, and of course, big bucks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Teasanne Kombe is a hair stylist at the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. Sassy, stunning and sophisticated, Teasanne has studied the art of haute coiffure in such high fashion centers as Paris and Milan. She recently returned to the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop, the salon where she first learned to trim, tease and detangle. Teasanne wears nothing but the latest in dark-colored clothing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ruby Redhedd is a ravishing redhead as well as a reporter for the local Looslypes Herald. Flashy, famous and fearless, she's got the guts to go for the important exposes. Some say she has the total package: brains, ambition, and beauty, and that one day she'll be an anchor on a major network news station. Ruby is a regular at the Loopey Lady and wears only business suits&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flo Z. Frizzee is the shop's stylist who specializes in the art of perming. Big or small, she'll curl them all. Ingenious, elegant and slightly introverted, Flo is a whiz when it comes to chemical applications, and she's never afraid to try out the latest technology, all in the name of hair science. Often caught with her nose in a chemistry book, Flo dresses for comfort and not for fashion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Harriet Hilite is the wife of the wealthiest doctor in town, and an active member of the local Gamma Gabba Gabba women's sorority. Refined, regal and ravishing, Harriet has an absolute gift for gossip and is considered a well-connected link in Looslype's grapevine. She is a weekly customer at the Loopey Lady, and whether she dresses up or dresses down, she only wears designer duds and her finest jewelry.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All right, ladies . . . need an excuse to get together with your gal-pals and have a good giggle-fest? Then here's the perfect mystery party game for you! It doesn't get any goofier than this one!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And here's the beauty part of this game. (And I do mean &amp;quot;beauty!&amp;quot;) This game is written to be part of an at-home spa/pampering party. That's right. For a really memorable event, we recommend mud masks, manicures, and more. Suggestions on how to host an easy pampering party are included in the game instructions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Again, we bring you the ultimate in easy entertaining. Costuming is ultra easy -- this is a virtual come-as-you-are party. Though the truly adventurous might consider arriving in cold cream and curlers . . . We also suggest serving appetizers instead of a meal with this one, so you'll have plenty of time for the pampering part of the party. This is a great game for bridal showers, birthdays, and just having fun with your female friends!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
