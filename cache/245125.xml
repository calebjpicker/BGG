						               													<description>&amp;quot;...a story of dueling, which became a legend in the army, runs through the epic of imperial wars. To the surprise and admiration of their fellows, two officers, like insane artists trying to gild refined gold or paint the lily, pursued a private contest through the years of universal carnage.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Joseph Conrad, The Duel: Point of Honor, 1908&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Duel: Point of Honor is a two player tactical card game that offers a fast-paced tactical experience. The game highlights elements of dueling culture, sword-fighting, and the discipline of martial arts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are a robotic soldier in a life-long rivalry. Every few years, you meet your opponent to test your skill and to preserve your honor. In each game, opponents will participate in multiple duels to earn the most Prestige while managing to stay alive in the process. Each duel will be a choice when and how to attack your opponent in the most efficient manner. Players will then have the opportunity to evolve their play to surprise their opponents in later rounds with newfound tactics and attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Duel players will challenge each other with subtle but impactful decisions within this ten-minute card game. The game is enacted through a series of escalating duels fought between the players. In each duel, players will earn Prestige by dealing damage and playing faster timing cards than their opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each duel consists of three rounds of combat, divided into two phases: Timing Phase and Action Phase. In the Timing Phase, players simultaneously choose a card from their hand to bid on turn order. In the Action Phase, players will play cards to try to win the duel. After each duel, players earn prestige and can gain better cards from the Advanced Techniques Deck. At the end of a duel, if a player has earned 7 Prestige, the game is over and the player with the most Prestige wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The art and graphic design of the game captures the look and feel of renaissance era aristocracy. And the game's illustrations evokes the grace and intelligence of sword-fighting... but also robots.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
