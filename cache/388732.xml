						               													<description>&amp;quot;It is a game of strategy and skill which can be playing by young and old, by anyone who likes hockey. It is intensely interesting, but simple, and although dice are used, you will find that skill and not luck usually decides the winner. The National Hockey League Game offers endless changes to develop plays on attacks and defense, just as in the real game played on the ice.&amp;quot; - From intro of rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players control their Forwards (3), Defensemen (2) and Goalkeeper (1). The players are simultaneously attacking and defending. Forwards try to get across the goal crease line past the defense and the goalkeeper. This will score a goal but 2 forwards must be past the blueline for this to count, otherwise it is offside. The defense can &amp;quot;check&amp;quot; the forwards by landing on the same square occupied by a forward which sends them back to their starting location. Goalies are restricted to movement inside the goal crease only and can make saves by &amp;quot;blocking&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All movement for the game is done with dice. The game's length can be set beforehand between both players but it is recommended to do a &amp;quot;best out of ___&amp;quot; style game of 3, 5, 7 etc goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
