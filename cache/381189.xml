						               													<description>The goal of Blocus is for each player (or team) to delimite as large a territory as possible on the board. The boundaries of this territory are determined by the movement of each player's (or team's) pieces. In fact, each player, while placing each of their pieces on a square, must simultaneously place a counter of their color (white, black, or red) on that square. It is these markers that determine the outlines of the borders of the territory conquered by the player (or team). There is no specific rule for a starting lineup of figures. Each player places his figures where he wants on his first moves and immediately marks the square with a marker in his color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The figures have different shapes and colors so that each player (or team) can identify their own. However, all have the same value and move in the same way: like the chess queen, they can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally, in any direction, one, two or more squares.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, under no circumstances may a figure cross a square already covered by a counter, regardless of the color of that counter. Also, a figure cannot land on a square that is already covered by a counter. It also cannot go over a square occupied by another piece and of course it cannot stop there either. A figure that can't move anymore is eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game ends when all of a player's (or team's) pieces are eliminated. Whether there are two, three or four players, a game also ends when a total of five figures have been removed from the game. The final score is determined by counting the empty squares within the borders. There is one point for each empty square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
