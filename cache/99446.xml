						               													<description>Behind The Glass is a card game where players manage their own TV Channels and try to earn the most viewers from 4 different target groups by designing the most efficient schedule each day. Their aim in the short-run is to fulfill advertising contracts to get money and in the long-run to gain viewers from those groups which eventually will give them victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action phase is played by using employees cards in order to perform common or special (more efficient) actions. Each employee card represents either a unique special action or a boost of a common action. Each employee, after he/she has been played is discarded. So players must constantly plan their hand keeping in mind the hand limit and the emploeyees available in market.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must manage their daily schedule by purchasing Films and placing them face down next to current day's viewers. Each film has a quality and a duration which constraints the available slots (for example, movies take 3 zones, so a player cannot place a movie in zone 1 and then place another film in zone 2). Also, some employees can boost this quality during the broadcasting phase, producing unexpected results! Films can also be used as advertisments of the channel. They can be discarded in order to grant 1 quality in a matching viewer of the next day's program. Finally, films, according to their type, may give players important end game bonuses (for example, fulfilling an action series 3 times, thus completing a season, will grant 10 working class viewers at the end of the game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning players do not have any money. They will go in red as they will buy films and workers but soon they will need to fulfill advertising contracts in order to get money (or play some shows) and become profitable. At the end money will be added (or subtracted) to the final score. Advertising contracts can give a lot of money if they are fulfilled before expiration (some employees can extend those contracts).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, players have the ability to create their own custom films and then use them for their program or sell them for good money. Also, designing internal productions is the only way to get Managers who give strong and long-term abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Are you ready to manage a TV Channel efficiently? Getting most viewers is a must but at the same time you have to do it in the most profitable way!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
