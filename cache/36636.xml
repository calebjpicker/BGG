						               													<description>'Housing Drive' is a board game published by Pepys Games of London in the 1940's.&amp;#10; 2-6 players race to complete a housing estate using the least government subsidy possible. Houses are built by, first, obtaining a &amp;quot;Licence to Build&amp;quot; and then blue, red and green counters, representing respectively Units of Labour, Units of Material and Units of Power.Players may trade counters to complete their housing estates. Each player is provided with a Playing Board representing a Housing Estate and indicating positions for the various pieces used during the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the 1940's this was a topical subject for a board game as the British government was replacing housing stock destroyed by the Luftwaffe and also trying to provide more 'Homes fit for heroes'&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is notable for the quality of its components - metal dice, counters, coins, good quality wooden houses and Playing Boards - at a time when rationing was still in place and raw materials were at a premium.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At some time the box was enlarged, and the rules were subsequently enlarged from 2 to 3 pages. Parts of some rules were rewritten, and explanations of some rules expanded. Two new paragraphs were added at the end. One was headed, &amp;quot;Housing Drive, Shorter Version&amp;quot;. The other was headed &amp;quot;Housing Drive, Simplified Version&amp;quot;, described as &amp;quot;a simple game for young children.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player who completes the game and has no Government Subsidy debited against him/her is the winner. If two players qualify, the one who has built the most houses wins. If all players have Government Subsidies debited against them, then &amp;quot;the player whose Government Subsidy per House is the lowest is the winner.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Incidentally, the front of the game describes it as being for 2 to 8 players, although the rules and pieces are clearly for 2 to 6 players (e.g. there are only 6 playing boards). At some time a red sticker was placed on the enlarged box correcting the error.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
