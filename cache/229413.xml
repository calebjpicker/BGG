						               													<description>Description &amp;amp; Theme&amp;#10;Wrestlers! Management has asked you to stick around and put together a dark match to keep the fans in their seats. There isn't enough time to choreograph the whole match, so it is up to you to put on and improvise the best match possible. The only requirement is there are specific spots management wants you to hit because the fans want to see what the fans want to see! Can you put on the most electrifying match and keep the fans cheering or will the only sound you hear after the 1-2-3 be the sound of crickets?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal of the Game&amp;#10;Unlike other head-to-head wrestling themed games or fighting games, the goal is not to beat your opponent by depleting their hit points. The goal is to put on the best match possible and getting the most fans (victory points)!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;1. Separate the cards into a Momentum Deck (cards 1 &amp;ndash; 7) and a Spot Deck (cards 8 &amp;ndash; 13).&amp;#10;2. Place 3 pairs of Spot cards in the center of the table face up. The sum of each of the pairs is the goal you are trying to reach for each Spot.&amp;#10;3. Place the Momentum Deck to another side.&amp;#10;4. Each player draws 5 cards from the Momentum Deck.&amp;#10;5. Choose a player to go first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players now take turns playing a card from their hand on one Spot, trying to reach that goal on their turn. Reaching that goal perfectly wins the Spot and equates to more fans, but passing (when a valid card can't be played) forfeits the Spot to the opponent and giving them more fans. Cards played from the hand represent simple wrestling moves, like strikes and holds, that escalate to the Spot, which are power moves like DDTs and spears!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When there are no Momentum cards or Spots remaining, players enter the Pin Fall attempt! Play turns into a War-style game, flipping over remaining cards in the hand to see who wins the pin. After the pin, all Perfect and Botched (passed) Spots are scored up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reading your opponent, evaluating the cards in play, the cards in your hand, and measuring the potential outcomes on future Spots will determine the bright fan favorite in ASWG: Dark Match!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
