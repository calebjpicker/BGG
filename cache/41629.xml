						               													<description>The collectible cards game from Thailand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player roles to be the God (Deva) and summon their avatar and disciples to fight for your divine power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The god who lose all his/her faith point will be the loser.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game has 3 card types: Soldier card, Hero card and Event card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Its 1st set is Half Blood Deal in 2007.&amp;#10;.....................................................................&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to Devacurse in English, an ongoing English-language guide to Devacurse, Thailand&amp;rsquo;s premier trading card game. Devacurse presents a universe rent asunder by the warfare of rival gods.  Once-calm seas roil with the venom of serpentine nagas, Yaksas leave villages burning in their molten wake, and fearsome Himmapan creatures bellow their fury at the world of men.  Noble heroes, stately Garuda warriors, cunning Monkey lords, and treacherous demons lead their forces into battle in this epic conflict drawn from the lush imagination of Southeast Asian mythology.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Read on to learn about Devacurse&amp;rsquo;s setting, and what this ongoing journal has in store for curious English-speaking gamers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take on the roles of Devas, divine entities commanding the elements of earth, wood, fire, metal, water, and wind.  You will need to master them to defeat your opponent, a god just as powerful and determined to rule as you.  Whether you incarnate directly on the battlefield as a hero or bombard your enemy from afar with devastating incantations, you will need wits as well as strength to survive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bless your warriors, summon allies, and commit your forces wisely in the ultimate contest of skill and intellect.  In Devacurse there can be no middle ground.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner will inherit a universe; the loser, cold oblivion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Background:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Devacurse was born from the imagination of Dr. Eiamchan Srithanon and his design team, the 6 Devabrothers:  SrithaNa Eiamchan and Mr. Korn (rules team and card designers), Sarit Chareonpanichkul (art director and trophy model sculptor) and Veerawat Jangpetch (art director), Saranyu (story director and character designer), and Srichai Eiamchan (production).  SrithaNa, Korn, Veerawat, and Saranyu were still studying architecture at King Mongkut&amp;rsquo;s University of Technology Thonburi (KMIT) at the time, and art director Sarit was brought in from outside to complete the team.  Dr. Srithanon and his friends had been avid card gamers for years, but after seeing fellow Thais playing endless Western and Japanese imports, they decided it was time to create a distinctively Thai collectable card game.  Their goal was amibitious - Dr. Eiamchan and his team wanted to create a card game that didn&amp;rsquo;t just feature Thai themes or look Thai, but one whose game mechanics embodied Thai style.  Two years of development and playtesting followed, and in 2007 Devacurse came on the market with an initial base set release, Half Blood Deal.  This was followed in 2008 with the first expansion set, Vengeful Kindred.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Devacurse immediately impressed Thai players with its high production values, elegant design, and lavish artwork, with many comparing its high level of presentation to that of Wizards of the Coast&amp;rsquo;s Magic the Gathering.  Currently Devacurse commissions work from over 30 professional artists in Thailand.  Once players learned the rules, they were impressed again by supple game mechanics that rewarded tactical planning and captured the essence of Thai culture.  Specifically, the game strongly recalls the fantastical world of the Thai Ramayana painted on the walls of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, in the Royal Palace complex in Bangkok.  It also subtly incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist prayer and Samsara, the cycle of reincarnation, into the structure of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Devacurse card layout incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist and Hindu cosmology.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Devacurse is a sophisticated and still-evolving piece of genuinely Thai pop culture in a country that is often swamped by Western and Japanese influence, imports, and imitations.  Dr. Srithanon and his team are committed to bringing the legends of their heritage to life in the game, and the results so far have been unique and beguiling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Devacurse is currently published only in Thai, and has therefore been limited to Thai audiences.  This website aims to open up the world of Devacurse to English-speaking gamers and enthusiasts of Thai culture and Southeast Asian myth.  In the coming weeks and months I will be putting up a complete English translation of the Devacurse rulebook, followed by English translations of all of the current Devacurse cards (Half Blood Deal through Vengeful Kindred).  There will be an in-depth review of the game, and other articles on a variety of subjects (card spotlight, deck design, strategy, back story) will hopefully follow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If all goes well, determined English speakers should be able to play and enjoy the Thai edition of Devacurse with the information posted on this website, until such a time as Devacurse is published in English.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Enjoy, and welcome to the epic world of Devacurse.&amp;#10;............&amp;#10;&amp;#10;more ....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;http://devacurseinenglish.wordpress.com  (English)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;http:// www.devacurse.com  (Thai)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
