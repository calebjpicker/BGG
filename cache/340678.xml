						               													<description>Decoratifs is an abstract card game for 2 players consisting of only 12 cards with art deco aesthetics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards are divided into 4 quadrants, each quadrant contains 1 to 3 of either of two symbols in the game.  The players are trying to create areas of their connected symbols.  At game's end, each player compares their 3 largest areas, the player who has more large areas wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of 6 rounds.  In each round, players play a card from their hands simultaneously. The cards are numbered from 1-12. The player with the lower number takes the first turn.  On your turn, you must place your card so that one of its corners overlaps the corner of a card in the &amp;quot;grid.&amp;quot; You may overlap up to 2 different cards. No card, however, may have more than 2 of its corners covered up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After playing a card, you replenish your hand by taking one of two face-up cards that were flipped at the start of the round. If you played first this round, you must take the higher numbered card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all 12 cards have been added to the grid, players check their three largest areas and the winner is determined.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
