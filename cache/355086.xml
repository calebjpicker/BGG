						               													<description>Card Game is a communal card game where the rules are only limited to the submission requirements. The end goal of the game is defined entirely by the players and the cards they decide to play as the game progresses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Player is/has: 1 Deck, a 4 card starting hand, and a zone to play cards. The cards tell the players everything else, and players must fill in the blanks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game requires you to play it before there is a clear end state, but as long as you follow the instructions of the cards, you will reach it. ~10% of cards contain win and loss scenarios. Normal gameplay revolves around setting up a zone in anticipation for a way to win, and all actions are done with the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players draw 1 card per turn, and play cards from their hand. [Places] are played in the player's respective zones, as are [People] and [Things]. [Things That Happen] are played, and then discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Each card has a NAME.&amp;#10;2. Each card has a TYPE (Person, Place, Thing, or Thing That Happens).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards can have any optional keywords alongside their name and type. Common examples include: &amp;#10;Hand, Deck, Zone, Space, Discard, HP, Damage, Can't, Point, Win, Lose, Friend, Draw, Move, Tie, Counter, Opponent, Turn, Player, You, Look, Stack, Game, Card, Flip, Effect, Gain, Choose, Facedown, Drift or any others you may think of.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Percentages of each card type are constantly changing with every submission and print run.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a collectable card game. All proxies and bootlegs of official &amp;quot;Card Game&amp;quot; cards are legally sanctioned and considered &amp;quot;genuine&amp;quot; cards for casual or constructed play. This includes cards that are altered in terms of effects, art, printing quality, or physical alterations and damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
