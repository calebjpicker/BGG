						               													<description>Tilting at Windmills is a 17-card, hand-management, charming, puzzle-y game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Life is nasty, brutish, and short when your nose is to the grindstone. There is wood to chop; grain to mill; cloth to weave. Sure, you've got six (seven? who can keep track?) dependable if not-particularly-bright children who help with the chores. But then some misguided nut comes along and tears a hole in your sail with his lance. Use your limited energy wisely to keep your windmill from falling into ruins, season after season.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
