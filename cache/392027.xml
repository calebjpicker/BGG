						               													<description>In Climate Cooldown, you and your fellow players are cooperatively playing as four regions of the globe to help save the planet from ecological destruction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The main goal of Climate Cooldown is to cool down our impact on the planet before the Global meter reaches 30. Each region must invest in sustainable power, divest from unsustainable power and heal the land and ocean with climate solutions called &amp;ldquo;Cooldowns&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round of the game, players begin by drawing their resource cards for their regions. Then, they draw a Disaster card for each region. Next, players go in a circle taking their turn for their region or regions. Players must strategize how to use their region&amp;rsquo;s energy, water and food resource cards. Players are able to freely trade with one another&amp;rsquo;s regions during their turns. They can use their resources to invest in Power cards, Cooldown cards, Diplomacy tiles, or divest from Unsustainable Power cards. At the end of each round the Impact meter either increases or decreases the Global meter. There are also land restoration and ocean health requirements that must be met by the end of each round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win the game, each of the 4 regions must invest in at least 2 Sustainable Power cards and then divest from an Unsustainable Power card type. Collectively, players must invest in Cooldown cards which can give them Land and Ocean tokens which help to fill all of the slots on the world map. Finally, the Global meter must be brought down into the blue. The Global meter can be lowered once the Impact meter is brought down below zero. If the Global meter reaches 30, it's game over. Players have up to 5 rounds to save the planet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
