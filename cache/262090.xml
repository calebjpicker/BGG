						               													<description>Surrounded by the darkness of the Imperium Nihilus, Vigilus is a world beset by horrors, but the most insidious threat is one that has emerged from within. The mutated xenos-human hybrids of the genestealer Cults have hidden in the shadowy depths of Vigilus&amp;rsquo; hivesprawls for generations. Now they have arisen to slaughter their Imperial oppressors and prepare the world for the coming of the Star Children. While the planet&amp;rsquo;s defenders fight desperately to hold off hordes of invaders, a strike force of Space Wolves sets out to hunt down the cultist insurgents, find the source of the Genestealer Curse and purge their enemy from existence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tooth and Claw is a great-value boxed set containing 2 armies split across the forces of the Space Wolves &amp;ndash; a fiercely independent Space Marine Chapter who have existed for ten millennia &amp;ndash; and the Genestealer Cults &amp;ndash; a sinister organisation of hybrids whose swollen ranks will surely conquer. You can use these miniatures to act out the scenarios described in the Tooth and Claw book &amp;ndash; 4 connected missions that recreate the violence on Vigilus &amp;ndash; and use them to expand your games of Warhammer 40,000.
