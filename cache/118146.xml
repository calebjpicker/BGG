						               													<description>The Four Horsemen... They&amp;rsquo;ve always been here. Whenever humanity has stepped too close to the abyss, they&amp;rsquo;ve come. Often taking the guise of whatever was causing the Apocalypse of that particular age. The Fall of Rome, the Black Plague, World War 2, they were here. Ready to help usher in the end of man. United in the goal, but never the means. Because of this, either by some sort of grand plan or merely by chance, a balance has formed, preserving the time of man again and again. The Horsemen&amp;rsquo;s individual desires to be &amp;quot;The One&amp;quot; to snuff the candle of mankind&amp;rsquo;s light actually thwarting the very event they hoped to cause. Then came the Zombie Apocalypse, and again they came. War, relishing the conflict and self destruction of humans- now even after death. Famine, bringing hunger and desperation to both the living and the undead. Pestilence, with pain and suffering that could last this time even after one&amp;rsquo;s last breath was drawn. And finally Death, savoring the slow rot of a person&amp;rsquo;s demise more than ever before. But this time they weren&amp;rsquo;t alone. A Fifth Horseman has also come. One that could never exist before now. A Horseman born of music, technology, and the anger of a species on the brink. Will this new Horseman break the ages old balance that has existed and finally bring about the end of us all? Or is something else at play?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Fifth Horseman is a 2 Player game where the aim is to bring about the end of man by defeating your fellow Horsemen and laying sole claim to the final Apocalypse. You accomplish this by landing various Strikes that lower your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Life and Hand Size, as well as increasing your own. The Fifth Horseman uses 6 sided hex cards that allow each card the ability to use one of 6 different effects (Strikes). Victory is achieved when your opponent is depleted of Life points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
