						               													<description>The object of honeycombs&amp;trade; is to connect your tiles together by matching their symbols. The more matches you make the more points you earn.  The honeybee is wild and can be connected with any symbol. Honeycombs&amp;trade; has three unique ways to play, each varying in speed and competitiveness.  Choose the one that suits your mood.&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;Version A &amp;ndash; Worker Bee&amp;#10;   Fast-paced competition between opponents&amp;#10;   (2-4 players / 2-4 teams of 2)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Divide tiles evenly among all players/teams. &amp;#10;   2 players = 26 tiles each, 3 players = 17 tiles each, 4 players = 13 tiles each&amp;#10;2. Each player places their tiles face-down in front of themselves.&amp;#10;3. On the word &amp;lsquo;go&amp;rsquo; players turn over their tiles and connect as many matching symbols as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s a race to complete your honeycomb before &amp;#10;  your opponents complete theirs.&amp;#10;4. The first player to connect all their tiles together yells &amp;ldquo;HONEYCOMBS&amp;rdquo;. &amp;#10;   This signifies the end of the round and all other players must immediately stop. &amp;#10;5. Players quickly check the honeycomb of the player nearest to them to see if anyone has broken rules 1 and/or 2 (see rules 1 &amp;quot;Single Match&amp;quot; &amp;amp; 2 &amp;#10;   below). If so, deduct points accordingly. However, if the player finishing first is in violation of the rules, the round &amp;#10;   resumes until someone finishes with a mistake free honeycomb.&amp;#10;6. Next, each player calculates their points for the round - (See Scoring) and tells the scorekeeper. The scorekeeper keeps a running tally of &amp;#10;   everyone&amp;rsquo;s points.&amp;#10;7. Return all tiles to the bag to prepare for another round.&amp;#10;8. The player with the most points after 3 rounds is crowned Queen Bee.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Version B &amp;ndash; One Big Honeycomb&amp;#10;   A leisurely competition, one turn at a time&amp;#10;  (2-4 players / 2-4 teams of 2)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Players take turns to build one big honeycomb while collecting individual points.&amp;#10;2. Draw one tile and place it face up in the center of the table.&amp;#10;3. Each player draws three tiles from the bag.&amp;#10;4. Moving clockwise, players choose one of their three tiles and connects it to the honeycomb. One point is earned for every match made and it is added &amp;#10;   the player&amp;rsquo;s total.&amp;#10;5. After each turn, players draw one tile from the bag to replenish their hand.&amp;#10;6. When all 52 tiles have been connected to the honeycomb, the game is over and the player with the most points is the champion.&amp;#10;7. Some tiles have special powers which are indicated in the center of the tile. To maximize their value, be strategic in how you use them. They are &amp;#10;   only active in Version B- One Big Honeycomb.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special Power Tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Double Points: When playing a tile marked with the Double Points symbol &amp;quot;2X&amp;quot;, all points earned are doubled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Steal: When playing a tile marked with the Steal symbol (picture of a masked robber) you have the power to steal another player&amp;rsquo;s turn. Before &amp;#10;               a player lays their tile, yell &amp;ldquo;STEAL&amp;rdquo; to indicate you are stealing their turn. Lay your &amp;lsquo;Steal&amp;rsquo; tile and collect your points. &amp;#10;               Replenish your hand to 3 tiles.  Continue with the next scheduled player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Extra Turn: After taking your normal turn, you can play the Extra Turn tile (tile marked with a symbol of an arrow in a circle) &amp;#10;               right away. It is a bonus turn and does not affect your next turn. Replenish your hand to 3 tiles&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wild Tile: When playing the tile with the &amp;quot;bee&amp;quot; symbol in the center of the tile the player chooses 1 symbol on this tile to become wild. It can &amp;#10;               now be matched with any symbol.  *note: this is not to be confused with the wild bee on the perimeter of the tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Version C &amp;ndash; Honeycombs Puzzle&amp;#10;   Work together to build a creative honeycomb&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. All tiles are placed face up on the table as you would with a puzzle.&amp;#10;2. Players work together to build one honeycomb.  The object of this game is to make as many connections as possible.&amp;#10;3. Tiles can be moved around at any time, by any player.&amp;#10;4. Work at your own pace as everyone contributes at the same time.&amp;#10;5. When all tiles are connected to the players&amp;rsquo; satisfaction the game is over.&amp;#10;6. This is a non-competitive version; count the total points and record your score if you want.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rule 1: Single Match (Applies to Worker Bee Version Only)&amp;#10;When a round is finished, only one tile in a players honeycomb can have a single match. A single match is a one that is isolated (the symbols on either side of it are not matched). This means you cannot string tiles together in a train to finish quickly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rule 2: Mismatched Connection&amp;#10;If a mismatched connection is discovered when the round ends, the player must remove the tile with the mismatch without receiving any points&amp;#10;for it. For example, a player may need to remove a tile and forfeits 2 points even though 1 of the connections was a match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 match = 1 point&amp;#10;1 core connection = 5 points&amp;#10;Unused tile = minus 1 point (Worker Bee Version Only)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Score&amp;#10;1. Count your core connection points first&amp;#10;2. Count your matches. To ensure accuracy when counting, points should be tallied while you disassemble your honeycomb. As you remove each tile, count &amp;#10;   the number of matches it has. (see picture below)&amp;#10;3. Minus your negative points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Core Connection&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A core connection is a tile that has matched all 6 sides. In the One Big Honeycomb version, the player who placed the 6th and final tile earns the&amp;#10;core connection bonus of 5 points. This bonus is in addition to the points received from the connection(s) themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
