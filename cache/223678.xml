						               													<description>Slipstream is a compact card game for 2-4 players in which you take the role of scientists fighting your way through shifting dimensions to reach your control panel to return to your dimension. You are in a race across the 25 laboratory cards between you and your control panels. Each player gets a 'Slipstream Gun' card that allows them to warp themselves or others to different dimensions. Some dimensions contain cards that make the trip across the board easier, while other dimensions make the journey more perilous. Players must balance their urge to race across the board with their need to blast other players into neighboring dimensions. To win, a player must make it across the lab to their own control panel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn every player gets to perform one movement action and one 'Slipstream Gun' action. The movement action allows the players to move their token to a neighboring card, edging ever closer to their control panel, and victory. For their 'Slipstream Gun' action, players can choose to shoot any player (sending them to another dimension) or they can 'recalibrate' their gun by flipping the card over. This changes what dimension players will go to when shot with the 'Slipstream Gun'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start at one end of a 4x5 card grid. Their control panels are on the opposite side. All of the laboratory cards are face down and as players move on to each card, it is flipped face up and the events on the face of the card are incurred. These can offer benefits like moving forward or gaining an item card. They can also be negative like losing a turn or being sent to the 'Dark World' a dimension in which the cards are much more challenging.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when any player is able to make it all the way across the board and steps on to the colored control panel that matches their player token.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
