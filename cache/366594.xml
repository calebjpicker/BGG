						               													<description>In Farm Frenzy each player has to make their own farm work by speed-drafting cards that need to be matched to produce tokens which in return are used to resolve contracts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is high-speed and uses a common market concept where players can discard cards they don't need or can't use to the middle of the table and other may pick them up to use them. Of course, players gain points if other players used their cards, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has their own deck that consists of the same number and types of cards, with the exception that each deck has a unique back representing the given player's faction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the game starts, each players will lay three cards from the top of their decks to the player board's farm area. Then the game really begins. There are no turns, the game is being played in real time. Players will reveal new cards, one by one, from their decks and try to pair them with cards they have laid down on the three farm spaces or any of the cards from the middle of the table where the common market is. Remember: using a card from another faction will win that faction extra points at the end of the game, so pay attention who discarded what card!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will try to match cards: One Hatchet paired with a Apple Garden will generate one Apple Basket token. One Scythe paired with a Grain Field will generate a Flour token. And finally, one Food Basket paired with a Pig Farm will generate one Pig token. Of course, there are variations of these cards in your deck. Once a player has enough tokens to resolve a Contract Card, they can do so and score it. Once a player has solved all their ten contracts, the game will end, and the exciting and nail-biting scoring will begin; you gain points from scored Contract Cards and one points from each of your cards the other players used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;That game is a true draw and pair bonanza!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
