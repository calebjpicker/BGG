						               													<description>Sandeep Desai was born in Guild-occupied India. He was one of the many orphans of his city, and he was taken in and raised by a temple. He devoured books on the arcane and soon proved to be a powerful user of magic in his own right, but his peaceful life of learning came to a violent halt the day that the Guild arrested his master for undermining their authority. Sandeep took up his Master&amp;rsquo;s cursed Gada that day and unleashed the fury of Banasuva for the first time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sandeep was personally asked to come to Malifaux by Viktor Ramos in order to help train a new generation of Arcanists in the ways of magic. He holds his classes in secret, instilling in his students a respect for the arcane which he wishes he had on that fateful day back in India. He is an excellent teacher, and Ramos has been pleased with the progress of his students.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The locations of his classes frequently move, staying one step ahead of the Guild. In quiet moments of reflection and meditation, Sandeep often regrets the need for violence and wishes for a peaceful, quiet environment where his students could grow and prosper. He knows the tyranny and cruelty of the Guild all too well, and constant vigilance prevents him from dwelling on his own dark past.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sandeep&amp;rsquo;s box set contains six models, including Sandeep himself. Kudra, Sandeep&amp;rsquo;s loyal student, is his right-hand-woman, and she defends her teacher with arcane skill and physical prowess. Sandeep can summon his Totem, Banasuva, to present a large, flaming threat for his opponent. Finally, the Poison Gamin are versatile Minions which Sandeep is also capable of summoning.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
