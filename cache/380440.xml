By collecting, playing and manipulating cards accordingly, players put them together as profitable sets and valuable sequences as well as use them to thwart the opponent's plans. All that for gaining the highest score at the end and winning the game. There are several ways of gaining points and performing actions, so each player may find his own method for playing. To get more points, players have to push their luck hard to take certain actions in their favor or against the opponent. But they have to be careful - these actions may quickly turn against them because of immediate opponent's return actions during the same turn!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The gameplay combines core mechanics such as Push your luck, Set/Sequence Collection, Hand management and Gaining score. Taking into account the quickly passing time, players are forced to constantly balance their tactics as well as adapt their luck based decisions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Besides the default multiplayer gameplay, Continuum also contains a solitaire variant which introduces a demanding Automa opponent to compete with. This mode imitates the standard multiplayer game. It includes all features and competitiveness of a 2 player game but without the need of a human opponent. The Automa cards determine the difficulty and aggressiveness of the Automa opponent. Player may tune the Automa profile to his liking during game setup.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Continuum offers an endless replayability. This, combined with a very quick setup and pleasantly short gameplay time, encourages players to play several games in a row. With handy components, the game fits perfectly for lunch breaks, trips and any occasions when there's only a short time available. Additionally, the digital version of the game will do great in remote, online play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Check the forum thread for game presentation and all official resources/files/links&amp;#10;[OFFICIAL] - Game presentation + PnP files + Links + WIP Thread + Digital versions&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
