						               													<description>As a lifelong member of the Tokyo police force, you have seen and investigated many horrific things. However, nothing left you as disturbed or shaken as the house. . . The house was one of your very first investigations after being promoted to Detective. An elderly woman who lived there disappeared for months, inciting a missing person investigation, only to have her turn up a year later in the empty home . . . her head removed. You never did figure out where the woman vanished to in all those months, and you never figured out who killed her. All you know is that after you stepped foot in the house, your life took a turn for the worse. Your wife died, your home burned down, and things never seemed to get better. Now, near retirement and severely alcoholic, you are determined to go back to the house and figure out just what is going on in there once and for all. Somehow, however, you know that whatever is living there . . . it is evil.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is Something in the House is a simple Roll+Write inspired by Japanese horror media. It is a miniature print and play-style board game with storytelling elements where you take on the role of a retiring police detective. All you need is the 2 game sheets, a pencil, and some dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turn down the lights, turn on some spooky music, and play by candlelight!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
