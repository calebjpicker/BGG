It started with 2 friends kicking ideas around back in 1992. Then we designed it. One friend printed a prototype. The other friend took the idea and made it a dream come true when the prototype was sent for manufacturing. The game was printed and packaged in 2014 for sale. Since then it&amp;rsquo;s been marketing and playing the game with many friends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (adapted)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
