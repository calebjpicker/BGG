						               													<description>You were desperate and you were foolish. You borrowed 50 gems from the infamous Crows gang and now they want it back, with interest, within 3 days. You're a lowly skinner at the local maggot farm, there's no way you'll earn that kind of money in time, and the Crows aren't known for their flexibility.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fortunately, there's gems waiting for someone with the right amount of skill, ambition and luck. You could go fishing at the beach and sell your haul to the local fishermen or forage in the glade for ingredients and craft exotic brews. You could scavenge in the local dump for materials to make tools or shoplift from the market.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you're feeling lucky the carnival has come to town. If you're feeling brave the miner's guild has no shortage of quests that need completing in the nearby pits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This solo adventure game is the first in a planned series of Small Tin Tale games. It takes place in Brighthelm, the world first brought to life in Paupers' Ladder.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
