						               													<description>The ants, as present as invisible in our daily lives, will wage a bid between obstacles and impediments, to form a colony larger than that of their rivals, connecting underground paths and above all teaching us, while we play, what this important work is about as tiny.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cavando entre T&amp;uacute;neles&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players play ants and are trying to dig a set of tunnels to reach the queen. The road can get complicated if obstacles appear, but in the end, the ants always reach their goal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, players use cards to build tunnels to their queen and place obstacles in the other players paths. You must end your turn with exactly five cards in hand. Only one card can be played per turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues until one player manages to lower the minimum number of tunnels, in order to place the queen at the end of the course and thus win the game (as long as all the cards are connected). As soon as you have played the required number of cards in a continuous line, you can add your queen to the end of this line in the same turn and win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hormiguero Infinito&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From top to bottom or from bottom to top, connect the paths of the underground maze and create your own anthill. You are going to enjoy a game without limits and with infinite possibilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trabajo de Hormiga&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Collecting 100 ants for your anthill is not easy. To form this colony successfully you always have to start with La Reina. While working both on the surface and in the humid tunnels, you will have to be careful of the obstacles that will stop them.&amp;#10;your progress in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn, players must lay down a queen cards and then add tunnel card and ant cards totalling up to 100 ants. Or they can try to sabotage their opponents by playing obstacle cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ATTENTION: If the queen is not lowered, cards cannot be downloaded from tunnels or grass, since a colony does not exist without it. Once she is there, those cards are lowered until an obstacle is presented. Whoever has one in their anthill cannot continue to download cards until they solve it with the corresponding card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The first player to solve all their obstacles and add more than 100 ants to their lowered cards will be the winner.&amp;#10;     There are no more cards in the deck and the players have discarded all the cards in their hand, or that no one can bring down more cards, because the game is blocked. In this case, the dropped ants must be added, and whoever gets the most wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
