						               													<description>The Exodus TCG is an extremely fast-paced card game, designed to play in an average of 5-10 minutes suitable for all ages and skill levels. It's the first trading card game in the world to feature mechanics that affect card rarity! There's no banlist, no rotation, and no reprints from set-to-set. Expansions offer new and interesting mechanics and themes without relying on power-creep.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A mass Exodus to the newborn planet Eeventide is occurring. As you venture from Earth to Eeventide, you become a Drifter, gaining the ability to fly and drift across a new world. Forge a special deck of cards from stardust, and battle other Drifters by summoning massive creatures to fight for you! Your very existence is bound to the planet by a mysterious contraption that glows with an ethereal light. You can join a faction or fight solo as you pave a path.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first three guilds have risen, Dragonis, Skyborn &amp;amp; the Order, each fighting over a planet that requires constant conflict in order to remain stable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players begin the game with 10 Life Points, which represent their will to battle. Each player takes turns playing by following the 5 Phases of a Turn:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;         Draw Phase: Draw 3 cards from your Energy Deck and 3 cards from your Main Deck&amp;#10;         Energy Phase: Play your energy onto the field by stacking them into piles in any arrangement you'd like (maximum 3-energy per pile by default)&amp;#10;         Creature Phase: Summon as many creatures from your hand as you'd like by placing them on blank piles of energy&amp;#10;         Attack Phase: Attack your opponent's creatures using your own, or attack their Life Points directly if they have no creatures&amp;#10;         End Phase: Pass the turn to your opponent&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players win the game by using their creatures to attack their opponent's Life Points directly. Each energy behind a creature counts as 1 point of damage in a direct attack. Players can attack with as many creatures as they want during their turn, and use instant-speed Symmetry cards to make their creatures stronger or to drastically change circumstances during a duel. Symmetry cards are like quick-play instants that can be played literally at any time to interrupt gameplay (they can be used on your turn or your opponent's turn, on any phase)!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Energy cards are universal in function, so players can use any combination of cards. Decks can be constructed by following the one simple rule of limiting 2 copies of a card per deck (excluding energy).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Set 1) Birth of Creation Harmonized Dragonis &amp;amp; Skyborn Starter Decks (Unlimited Edition) are now available, Premiere Edition is sold out,&amp;#10;(Set 2) Galaxy Tides (First Edition) Boosters are now available,&amp;#10;(Set 3) Crystal Forge Treeforge &amp;amp; Shardveil Competitive Decks (First Edition) are now available, released August 2017,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
