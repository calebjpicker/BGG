						               													<description>2260&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a time of war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over one hundred and fifty years ago, mankind began its relentless conquest of the stars. With the realization of infinite resources came infinite greed. What is the point of difficult compromise and drawn out negotiations when strength could gain anything a nation, corporation, or unaligned military force could desire? What need for a minority population to bend to the will of the majority when they could just as easily forge a nation of their own on a virgin world?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Human space is dominated by intense nationalism, rampant balkanization, and brutal competition. Only the Watch keep man from tipping into a new dark age and utter self destruction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And man is not the only predator in space...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alien War is a game of ground combat for 28mm (1/56 scale) models set in the year 2260. The rules are designed to give you an authentic feel for future warfare including unpredictable events &amp;ndash; sudden rushes, explosions, ambushes, and malfunctioning weapons &amp;ndash; that challenge your strategy and tactics as a tabletop general. The terrain can be as elaborate or as simple as you like; but the game is best played with lots of cover (buildings, trees, rocks, downed landing ships, etc). The playing area can represent anything from a futuristic cityscape to an alien forest to a Bug-infested hive!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player controls a Force that can be as small as a squad (6-15 models) up to a platoon or even a company in size (40-100 models or more). Some Forces may involve more models than others since they consist either of less skilled human troops (like colonial militia or poorly armed and trained conscripts) or aliens whose strength lies in their overwhelming numbers. As players become more experienced, they can control larger numbers of troops as well as vehicles and incorporate more advanced rules for future warfare. At its most basic size (squad level), a game of Alien War should take an hour or less to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
