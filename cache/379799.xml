						               													<description>Stranger Tales is a role-playing game (RPG) and Board Game in which we will play the role of kids who will have to face the &amp;ldquo;Evil&amp;rdquo;. We are in the 1980s, an era that you probably experienced directly or indirectly through films, music, board games, videogames and everything that that unique and unrepeatable decade has left thanks to the echo of a time near and far. Did you know that the 80s were full of monsters and creatures of all kinds? If your answer is no, you probably did not directly experience that era or you have been told that it was just rumors; but if you lived it, if you were a child or a kid during those years, you know what I'm talking about. Monsters existed and walked around on their own legs. Of course, adults would never have believed you, but I can guarantee you that at that time Evil had eyes and legs, mouths and teeth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The peculiarity of Stranger Tales is that you will have everything ready in one box: Just take it with you to experience fantastic adventures and you won't need anything else! Everything is in the box. Stranger Tales is also a mammoth work on &amp;rsquo;80s and &amp;rsquo;90s Pop Culture. In fact, in the definitive manual, you will find not only the rules to play but also contents that will help you identify yourself again&amp;mdash;or for the first time&amp;mdash;in a world so near and far.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Fusion Systemt hat was born in Tales of Evil and continued in Boogeyman here evolves to the highest levels. It will only be your imagination and what you find in the stories that set the limits; but in reality, there is no limit whatsoever. You will be able to integrate into the game any action or behavior you wish in order to help your Investigators during your adventure. You may even be able to foresee that some Tests could take place outside of the usual game session, such as challenging players with special tasks to complete &amp;ldquo;side quests&amp;rdquo; in their real life.  For example, nothing prevents you from requesting a certain type of flower or object be brought the next time you get together to play, or performing real actions such as going to a place and hiding something there and then asking the other players to find the object that you have hidden before your next game session. As you can see, the limits to what you can create with the Fusion System are practically infinite. Don't like the Fusion System? Don't love taking actions in your real life to directly influence the game? No problem. In agreement with the other players, you can safely decide not to use the Fusion System for your games. The beauty of Stranger Tales is precisely this&amp;mdash;that is to say, being able to adapt the game to your liking and in your image and likeness. Again, there is no limit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
