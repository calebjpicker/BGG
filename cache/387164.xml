						               													<description>King of Battle is a strategic modern battlefield game for two players. It was designed by a US Artillery Officer, and was made to teach modern battlefield tactics to tabletop game players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By planning artillery strikes one turn in advance, you will attempt to predict where your opponent will move their pieces, and then deal deadly artillery strike damage to the targeted square. Your tanks and infantry will attack in real-time as you maneuver your pieces to avoid your opponent&amp;rsquo;s artillery strikes and advance to victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Win the game by destroying your enemy or forcing them to surrender. You must surrender if you destroy too many of your own units through poor artillery planning, or if you find your artillery is outnumbered by your opponent's. Artillery is king, and you cannot function without them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Due to variable terrain placement, every game explodes with new strategies. Guessing where your opponent will move their pieces provides an addictive twist on modern strategy games. The end game never drags; it is designed to provide a quick ending, so that you can start the game again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
