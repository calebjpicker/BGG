						               													<description>Transformation of metals into gold? &amp;#10;It&amp;rsquo;s possible &amp;ndash; any physicist will say nowadays. In the 16th century, alchemists made attempts to do that in their laboratories, aspiring to gain wealth and never-ending fame. Some, as Edward Kelley, thanks to royal sponsors, achieved all that, nevertheless they never succeeded in transmutation of metals&amp;hellip; In this magical game that you are holding it&amp;rsquo;s very simple. &amp;#10;Build a laboratory and collect the necessary components. And transformation of metals? If you manage to adjust to the changing moods of the Spirit of Transmutation, then it&amp;rsquo;s really not complicated at all. So, what is the game about? You have competition in your town &amp;ndash; other alchemists who also know the right technology. Only the one of you who is the most efficient will win recognition and fame. It will surely last until the next game, or, who knows, perhaps eternally&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will try to be the most effective alchemist.&amp;#10;To achieve that they will need to build buildings, represented by cards. In these buildings, they will acquire resources, transform them into gold and finally sell them for victory points or cards. Selling gold isn't only way to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game is using Rondel mechanic to pick an action by players and hand management, where cards represent buildings, currency and resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alchemicus was designed as a family game with little negative interaction. Requests planning but also concentrating on other players movements and predicting them. Many beginners forget it, being focused on their own technology structure, so very often they fall behind. We think that this game style can be useful for teaching young players to think beyond their own needs. Anyway, the game is not for kids. The youngest of our testers who was able to win the play against his father was 12 years old (consider that his father is lawyer, so probably he is quite smart ;))) hahaha one of them. Father or son. we are not sure which one :D).&amp;#10;Because the factor of negative interaction is not very strong the play goes ahead in a nice atmosphere which is fun for family play.&amp;#10;Older players can play a bit differently, by using the position of The Transmutation Ghost to foil your opponents' plans. This strategy can be counteracted by defending yourself with buildings and goods in circulation which are resistant to your opponents' actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
