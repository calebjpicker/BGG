						               													<description>Tales of War is a competitive tactical board game for two players, which places you in the roles of army generals in the conflict for the Cross of Eternity, an ancient artefact holding the key to immortality!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board represents an open book filled with ever-changing terrain and mighty heroes leading their armies of medieval troops and fantasy creatures into battle. Each time you play the game, you write a new tale. It is your very own tale of war!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Key gameplay features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Skill-based combat. Players take turns activating one unit at a time and either move it to another position or attack an opponent&amp;acute;s unit. Tales of War doesn&amp;rsquo;t use dice, nor cards to resolve combat. Instead defeating enemy units is as simple as either moving your melee unit onto a square occupied by them or positioning your ranged units in the line of fire and range.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each unit has different equipment, which defines its special rules. For example, units equipped with spears will automatically repel a direct cavalry charge and archers cannot make a frontal assault on units armed with shields. A player can still use the cavalry to outmanoeuvre a unit equipped with spears and devastate it with a flank or rear charge, just as archers may trap a shielded enemy by attacking at an angle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 21 unit types and each has unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses. As the campaign progresses, your initially small force expands to include units, such as Elves, Dwarves, Fire and Ice Sorceresses, Giants, Hydras, Fire Elementals or even Vampires!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- RPG-like sense of progression and a constant arms race. Both armies evolve from one battle to the next, and your heroes learn new skills making them more dangerous on the battlefield;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Replayability. Tales of War offers new, unique challenges and strategic/tactical possibilities each time you play. Each battle has its own victory conditions and is played on unique terrain. You will face a different, custom-built army each battle, just as your own army will have been re-equipped and re-organised.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Fast setup and quick turns. Tales of War takes under 5 minutes to set up and tear down. Watching your opponents moves is as exciting as making your own as it always has an impact on the situation on the board;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Ease of saving campaign progress. Simply put your units and their cards into your army box and that's it. You can pick up where you left off in the next session.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
