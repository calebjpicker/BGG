						               													<description>The global politics of the late 1920&amp;rsquo;s and early 1930&amp;rsquo;s were in a constant state of flux. The alliances of the world&amp;rsquo;s major nations seemed to change every moment. The American Armed Forces needed to devise plans for any number of possible sudden conflicts. Scenarios were written based on current equipment, technology, and strategy. The Washington treaty of 1922 that limited the tonnage of ships for the major navies never happened. The military&amp;rsquo;s solution was WAR PLAN.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;War Plan: Orange was the code name given to the Navy&amp;rsquo;s scenarios dealing with a threat from Japan. Plan Orange was constantly modified as new ships, aircraft, technology, and strategies were improved. Equipment available to both sides at this time would have been fascinating to see in use, as is the focus of this game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This will be the first of a series of &amp;ldquo;War Plan&amp;rdquo; games from Historical Board Gaming. This boxed game will come complete with all components needed to play. Fight the intense battles between the Japanese and American Navies during the early 1930&amp;rsquo;s that never were. Utilizing fantasy ships like the Lexington Class battle-cruiser as designed before it was converted to an aircraft carrier, and the Colorado class Battleship that was scrapped before building, the American forces will take on Japanese ships like the Tosa, Amagi, Kii, and No. 13 Class Battleships as well as the infamous 3-flight deck versions of Kaga and Akagi. These beautiful ships, as well as aircraft and airships, will be represented in this game with actual plastic ships, planes, and airships based on designs from pre World War II. With pieces that match the scale of other famous games in the genre, fight the Plan Orange scenarios and then add them together with other games to make your own! Never before has a War Plan Orange board game been designed like this!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HBG&amp;rsquo;s War Plan series of games will use the game engine debuted in another of HBG&amp;rsquo;s popular games, The Battle of Midway. Expanding the combat sequence to include new units, these great ships will battle for supremacy of the Pacific. The movement and combat system utilizes an area movement dynamic and D6 damage resolution. Units take turns moving based on unit type, in an attempt to out maneuver enemy units and destroy key targets for victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;War Plan: Black is the next planned game in HBG&amp;rsquo;s War Plan series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents will include a map, Japanese and American plastic game pieces, rules, and a battle Board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Coming in 2014&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
