						               													<description>Koth is a two-player, fantasy-themed duel card game in which players assume the roles of the two attendents (Sina or Ames) of the god of war; Koth of the game world, to decide the outcome of a battle between Orcs and Humans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of a single deck of 52 cards. It is shared by both players to draw cards. There are 20 different kinds of units in the deck and these units are commanded onto the battlefield. Each unit has an ATTACK and a DEFENSE value. These values are used to dominate (attack) and hold (defend) a column. Some units also have ABILITIES (band, flank, rage, rally, and support) which give units additional skills than these two.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battlefield is divided into five sections. Each section is called a &amp;quot;column&amp;quot; and players compete to dominate those columns. To dominate a column a unit's ATTACK must be at least equal to the unit's DEFENSE that is holding it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have 10 Command Points (CP) for each round and they can command as many units as they please -provided they don't go over CP. Each unit has a CP cost equal to its ATTACK value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start the game with three cards and draw one card at the start of their turns, and they take turns to command units onto the battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win a game, one player must either control all of the five columns. In cases which this is not possible (i.e. when there's no more cards to draw and/or play) the player holding the most columns win the game. And whenever a player wins two consecutive games s/he wins the battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
