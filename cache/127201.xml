						               													<description>The title of this wargame for kids, published in Italy in 1940, means &amp;quot;Air-Naval War&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board has identical red and blue territories on each end.  The players follow a numbered line across the ocean to attack the other player based on a roll of the dice. Units can end up in the space which leads to combat. Each turn, each player must move one of their planes, submarines and ships (they have two of each in their starting armies), alternating until one of each unit type has moved. Players try to destroy each others units and bombard the enemy territory. This occurs when a unit ends its movement in an enemy occupied space. An airplane can bombard the wooden representations of the Fuel Dump, Ammo Dump, Rail Station, Bridge, Office, etc. and remove them as &amp;quot;booty&amp;quot;.  The units must always move in one direction (toward the enemy) until they reach the end of the path, at that point each unit is treated differently (planes fly backward to the first square and ships are immediately returned to the 1st square and start moving toward the enemy again).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Mas (torpedo boat) is an exception, it can move in both directions and sink any ship or plane that enters its space (it is only available to a player after that player has lost 3 units).&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;The island in the middle can be captured and fortified.  Victory occurs with one player destroys both enemy planes and half their ships.  There are no land based units except for an anti-air cannon which is placed in any empty, friendly land space at the beginning of the game.  It automatically destroys an airplane that ends it move in the same space.  Strategy comes from the choice of units to move each turn and becomes more involved with the activation of the Mas units.   It was released on June 10th, 1940, the day Italy enters World War 2.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
