						               													<description>Spell Wars is an intuitive, fast-paced strategy card game that is always entertaining and can be played by 2-4 players. Each player masters the eight schools of magic to defeat their opponents by dealing enough damage to reduce their Hit Points to 0. The deck comprises 64 cards, eight cards for each of the eight schools of magic found in DnD. Each of the eight cards has two different effects that allow for an almost unlimited combination of strategic decisions and outcomes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You must eliminate your opponents by dealing enough damage to reduce their Hit Points to 0. Some cards deal damage, some help players avoid taking damage, still others heal, but all allow for strategic decisions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck comprises 64 cards, eight from each of the eight schools of magic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has a number of Hit Points equal to the number of players, but a minimum of 3. A player who is reduced to 0 Hit Points is eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game shuffle the cards and place them in a draw pile facedown on the table. All players draw 6 cards from the draw pile. Randomly pick a player to go first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take their turns in clockwise order. Each player&amp;rsquo;s turn consists of the following phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Spellcasting Phase: A player can play up to 2 cards during their turn and only in the spellcasting phase. Abjuration cards (but not Illusion cards used as Abjuration cards) don&amp;rsquo;t count towards this limit and can also be played during an opponent's spellcasting or monster phases, even interrupting other cards or actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monster Phase: Each summoned monster may attack and deal 1 Hit Point of damage to a target player. A summoned monster can negate an attack by another monster, but both monsters must then be placed in the discard pile.&amp;#10;Draw Phase: The player&amp;rsquo;s turn ends by drawing 2 cards.&amp;#10;Used, discarded, and eliminated players&amp;rsquo; cards are placed facedown in the discard pile. Each player can look at the contents of the discard pile at any time during the game. Reshuffle the discard pile and use it as a new draw pile if the draw pile runs out of cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last player who has Hit Points remaining wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
