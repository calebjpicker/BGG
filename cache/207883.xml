						               													<description>Overwhelmed by the stress of the hooligan hootenanny that's overrunning the bustling town of Bandit Bluff, the resident deputy has up and left his post! Sheriff Croc Holliday is shuffling and hustling to find his next deputy. Looking to fill the vacancy, Croc has decided to put a pool of new recruits to work helping clean up some of Bandit Bluff's most wanted outlaws and will choose the most dedicated to be the new deputy! A little lying, some stealthy scheming, and the sense to know a good time to tell the truth might just help give a leg up over the rest of the herd. Who will out-law the other applicants to become the new deputy?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OutLawed! is a social game of bluffing, truth-telling, and out-thinking your opponents. Each player has an identical set of eleven outlaw cards imagined as animals escaped from the zoo somewhere in the wild, wild west. Over a series of rounds, players take turns playing a card face down and making a claim about which character card they played. Players are free to tell the truth about the character played or to make a bold-faced lie! After players have played cards and made their claims, all the characters are revealed and each player assesses whether or not they have met their outlaw's &amp;quot;apprehend if&amp;quot; condition. Players who were successful add their outlaws to their jail pile while all other players place the card back in their hand. Lionel Manesworth, for example, can be captured only if you tell the truth. The Vixen Twins get nabbed when others are convinced to play the same card during the round. Lawman Croc Holliday will catch anybody who isn't on the up and up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player fills up their jail, everyone compares their total reward value of apprehended cards to see who has earned the most rewards and gets to fill the vacant position as deputy of Bandit Bluff.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
