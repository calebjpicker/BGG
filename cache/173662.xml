						               													<description>Two fleets clash in a fast paced and exciting game of naval and air combat for two players - or up to four players if two sets of the game are used, Each player tries to find his opponent's ships, hidden within sea cards - and sink them before his opponent do the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played with two sets of 'sea' cards arrayed in 5 stacks of 7 cards each - a total of 35 sea cards for each player/fleet, in those cards the players must hide 6 ships: Battleship, Cruiser, Aircraft carrier, two destroyers, submarine and two Mines cards, the ships and mines can be placed in any order and possition within those 5 stacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game the players use a selection of three types of action cards, attack cards (red) Recon cards (blue) and Fleet cards (green), at each round players start with six cards on their hand, their composition (how many cards from each type they will have) is given by the 'formation' their fleet is following, for example: the recon formation will give more recon cards to a player than attack and fleet cards while a more aggresive formation (Full attack) will give to the player more attack cards than recon and fleet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the players only have six action cards on their hands at the start of each round discarding any that they use during the round and drawing new ones to replenish their hand (according to the formation they are in) they also have the 'Hangar deck' space, where they may land aircraft cards (some cards within the action decks are 'Aircraft cards') the hangar deck can have up to 6 aircraft cards and those cards can be used to attack and or to defend the fleet from attacking aircraft, a land/resupply system of not-ready / ready aircraft in the game simulates the whole process of landing aircraft supplying them and taking them off to accomplish missions.&amp;#10;   &amp;#10;Game Contents:&amp;#10;70 sea cards.&amp;#10;63 attack cards.&amp;#10;63 recon cards.&amp;#10;63 fleet cards.&amp;#10;lots of damage counters.&amp;#10;2 formation dials&amp;#10;2 formation pointers&amp;#10;2 hangar space decks.&amp;#10;Rulebook&amp;#10; game was ranked 6th in the Epitrapezio contest (Greece 2015)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
