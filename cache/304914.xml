						               													<description>The Stormy Seas expansion for Tranquility consists of three mini-expansions that significantly change the level of difficulty as well as introducing a nice variety of rule changes that make the game even more replayable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Jagged Rocks: The game begins with the Jagged Rocks card placed randomly on one of the six border cards on the left-hand side of the grid; this row is considered as temporarily impenetrable so no cards may be placed into it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Sea Monsters: The game begins with three, four or five Sea Monster cards shuffled into the deck before it is dealt out to players (depending on the level of difficulty the players wish to add). On their turn the player may play their Sea Monster card into the grid by placing it on top of any previously played card. The Sea Monster destroys the card and then both cards are removed from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Storm &amp;amp; Compass: The game begins with six Storm cards shuffled into the deck. The six Compass cards are placed to the side of the playing area. A player resolves a Storm card as soon as it is drawn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yellow Storm: The player places the Yellow Storm card face up in front of them and immediately discards down to three cards which is their new hand limit until the Storm card is removed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Purple Storm: The player places the Purple Storm on one of the six border cards on the left-hand side of the grid on a row with at least one empty space. This marks the entire row as temporarily impenetrable so no cards may be placed into it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Orange Storm: The player places the Orange Storm card face up in front of them. For all future turns the player may now only 1. Play next to an existing card, discarding the appropriate number of cards as per the usual rules or 2. Discard two cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Compass: Compass cards may be played to help the players navigate the Storms and remove playing restrictions. Compass cards may be acquired in three different ways: 1. When the start card is played, the players earn one Compass card to use. 2. By filling an entire row with consecutive cards (e.g. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) and 3. If a player chooses to discard their whole hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
