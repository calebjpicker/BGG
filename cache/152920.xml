						               													<description>Based on the short-lived German game show of the same name that ran from 1991-1992 on SAT.1 for which in turn is based on the short-lived American game show Trump Card for which in turn was based on the British game show Bob's Full House.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player is host, the other playing against each other. Each player gets a bingo tablet which has the numbers 1-15. In the middle of the table, the chips come. There always three quizzes played. In the first round of quiz is about the four corner squares on the bingo tablet. Who could cover these fields with answer chip first, wins that round. The moderator asks a question from the question stack, the player who first gets &amp;quot;BINGO&amp;quot;, then may say the solution. If you are correct, he or she is allowed to occupy a corner with a chip, the answer is wrong, the player has to suspend for one round.  Once all questions have been asked a map, the next red card is drawn. Once all of the corner squared occupied, the winner gets 5 points credited, all the other players get as many pluses as they have covered chips. After the second game round begins. The chips from the first round, however, remain lying on the tablet. During the second round should you fill the middle of the first three rows of chips, also get all the players according to the number of chips on the tablet points in payroll. The winner will be credited 10 points this time. As the yellow question cards are taken. And here, the chips remain on the panel. In the third round, the game works gain similar to the previous one has here blue cards, the player must now cover all remaining fields with chips and the winner gets 20 points added to his or her account. Those who could collect the most points after all three rounds, may eventually challenge the Super Bingo round. If he or she wins the round, so doubled his/her score. Otherwise, they halved. We play with final game screen, which is a 5x5 large square with the number 1-25. Now the hourglass comes to train. The player has the task within 60 seconds to form a line of 5 fields with the chips either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. It is also worked here with the blue question cards. The player always calls the first field which he/she must prove with a chip, then reads the question before the host. If this answered correctly, a white chip is placed on the field, otherwise a black chip is placed. Now the player is called quickly to the next field on which he/she would place his/her stone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after 60 seconds. The winner is the player who can have the most points after all four rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
