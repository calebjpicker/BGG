						               													<description>Each round, the active player expresses their opinion on a wide variety of topics &amp;ndash; movies, music, celebrities, politics, etc. Once they are done, play continues around the table with each player choosing to either draw a card and pass to the next player OR to pick up the gauntlet and deliver their own red-hot Rant on the topic!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once both players have delivered their impassioned opinion on the subject, the rest of the players vote on which Rant was the best.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The RANTMASTER who delivered the more popular Rant receives a point, and any players who voted for the more popular Rant also earn points. The first player to earn 7 points is the WINNER!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
