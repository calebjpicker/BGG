						               													<description>From the rules overview:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The small town of Kalina is struck by fear. A serial killer is on the loose and nothing seems to be able to stop him. The small police station in town is almost falling apart both on the outside and from the inside. And this is were you are. As the two Chief Inspectors of Kalina the players will have to work together to build a strong case against the Serial Killer in only three days. The only problem is that the boss has put a promotion out for the player that builds the strongest case against the Serial Killer. This means that the players will do anything to further their own investigation and all possible to hinder their opponents even though it has to look like they are both working together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players will play a card each that indicate a certain coorordinate. A lot of bluffing is involved in the game as there is only a limited cardplays for each player. The coordinates will be stocked with increasing amount of evidence for each day passing of the investigation.The players will also be able to move the serial killer himself in order to hinder the other players investigation by killing off his investigators.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player, who has built the strongest case against the Serial Killer in three days, by getting the most Case Points, wins the game. Case Points will mainly be gained by having the most of a certain type of evidence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the moment Graphic design is beeing conducted by Josh Cappel for the prototype that is going to be released at the Hippodice Competition 2011. Danish playtesters will be needed for final playtests September 2010. Prototype Artwork will be released on September 1st.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
