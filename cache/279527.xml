						               													<description>As Earth&amp;rsquo;s political powers are collapsing and the global economy is on the brink of meltdown, humanity once again looks towards the stars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You have been given the task to oversee the daring project to establish your organization as the dominant force of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbit. Unimaginable market potential is now within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach, just waiting to be exploited. In the dawn of a new aggressive space race, conflict is inevitable!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Orbital Conflict is a card game where each player during several turns build and modify a space station and manage its resources. Each turn is divided into three phases. Draw, Main and Combat phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the draw phase each player takes turn drawing two station cards and two investor cards. When all have done the draw phase the Main phase begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the main phase each player takes turn playing station cards from the hand to the player's station. They can either be played as a standalone module or extend existing once into more advanced modules. Cards can have production, requirements, attack, defense and victory points. The player will try to build a station that meets the demands of the two investor cards draw in previous phase. Investor are worth different amount of victory points, some are easy to claim while others require a big station. Some cards even has special abilities that apply when part of a station. When all have done the main phase the combat phase begins. Unclaimed investor cards are discarded (new once are draw in the draw phase).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the combat phase a player may choose to attack another player's station using modules with attack values or discard cards from the hand that gives additional attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the last card in the draw pile has been drawn a last turn is played. Afterwards each player counts victory points from claimed investors and from the station. The player with the highest amount wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Noteworthy mechanics are no hand limit, that station cards can extend by being placed on top or below existing once. Claimed investor cards have a mini-game like mechanic where they are pushed from the right or left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Orbital conflict balance station building, light resource management with aggressive combat and point gathering. There is no player elimination and stations can be destroyed and rebuilt several times during a game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
