						               													<description>What could be more fun than getting delicious food out of a truck? Serve it! In Food Trucks, you won't eat (although the food may make you hungry), but you'll be the proud owner of a food truck, and your main goal is to have the best food truck in town.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How will you get there? Easy, the customers will give you orders and, during your turn, you'll have to choose if you want to prepare orders or serve them. If you choose to prepare orders, you'll be able to pick up dishes from the common market, but think carefully what you choose, because you can't mix up dishes. If you want to serve orders, give customers their food and get those sweet coins, and be quick, because the customers are hungry and will punish you if you are too slow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
