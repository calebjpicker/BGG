						               													<description>Items needed:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     1 deck standard playing cards&amp;#10;     Two 6-sided dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;Each player will choose one suit of cards as their army then roll the die to determine who has the first turn. Each player then draws 3 cards from his deck and places his remaining cards aside. The person to win the first turn of the first round chooses an opponent from among the remaining players. To attack, he lays down one of his three chosen cards. The chosen opponent also lays down one of his three chosen cards.(Right before each player lays down his attacking card,it is best to snap the attacking card out of one&amp;rsquo;s own hand in a showy and extravagant manner. This is done to intimidate the other player. It is also quite enjoyable.)To determine the winner of the attack, each player must roll a die, combine that number with the value of his card, and whomever has the highest overall score wins the battle. Each number card is worth its face value (the Ace is worth 1 point, the 2 is worth 2 points, etc,), and each face card is worth 10 points. However, when attacking with a Jack, the Jack gains one offensive point becoming worth 11 points, and when defending with a Queen, the Queen gains 1 defensive point becoming worth 11 points. If a tie takes place, the defender wins the round. Play continues in clock-wise fashion with each player attacking only once each round. If a player has no cards when it is his turn to attack, then he is out for the remainder of the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each successive round is begun by the person clock-wise from the person to attack first in the previous round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner of the game is determined by the player with the last King left alive. If a player loses a King during game play, he may continue playing but cannot win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Suit powers&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hearts: Healers. At the end of each turn roll 1 die for any one card that fought during that turn. If the roll is odd, healing failed and proceed to next card or end turn. If even, roll die and regain health up to number rolled or max health (whichever comes first)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Spades: Necromancers. At the end of each turn, if any cards 1-6 &amp;ldquo;died&amp;quot; during that turn or in a previous turn they are eligible to be revived. Roll a die and revive any eligible card covered by the die. Example: If a 1 is rolled then an the ace (if eligible) can be revived. If a 5 is rolled, any card 1-5 that is eligible can be revived.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Diamonds: +Defense every card. +1 health and 50/50 chance to &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; an attack by rolling die when attacked. If even, a &amp;quot;block&amp;quot; happens and negates an additional damage point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Clubs: +Offense every card. +1 to attack roll and 50/50 chance to do &amp;ldquo;double damage&amp;rdquo; on an attack by rolling die when attacking. If even, a &amp;quot;double damage&amp;quot; happens and adds an additional damage point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
