						               													<description>This is a set of items for Blood Rage that were only available during the Kickstarter campaign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Among the exclusives there were four new monsters:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Wolfman/Wolfwoman: This monster comes with its figure and a card to add him to your Age 2 deck.&amp;#10;     Mystic Troll/Seer Troll: This monster will come with his miniature and a card to add him to your Age 3 deck.&amp;#10;     Mountain Giant/Mountain Giantess: This fearsome monster comes with its figure and card to add to your Age 1 deck. The Mountain Giant is a true behemoth, but since it counts as a Leader, it can Invade for free, and even benefit from Leader Upgrades you add to your clan!&amp;#10;     Fenrir/Garm: the giant wolf, son of Loki, comes with its figure and card to add to your Age 1 deck. Whatever province Fenrir is in during the Ragnar&amp;ouml;k phase is the one that is actually destroyed this Age! (unless he's in Yggdrasil, in which case his ability doesn't take effect)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2nd Edition came with three more monsters:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Ymir:  This monster comes with its figure and a card to add him to your Age 3 deck.&amp;#10;     Hildisv&amp;iacute;ni:  This monster comes with its figure and a card to add him to your Age 1 deck.&amp;#10;     N&amp;iacute;dh&amp;ouml;ggr:  This monster comes with its figure and a card to add him to your Age 2 deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the monsters, there were several upgraded components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Sculpted Clan Tokens: For each clan, a unique sculpt representing its clan animal. Four tokens are used by each clan to keep track of their current Rage, and their three stats: Rage, Axes, and Horns.&amp;#10;     Sculpted Saga Token: To help keep track of your game's progress through the last Ages of the world. This monolith engraved with Viking runes was designed by Adrian Smith to represent the telling of your Viking saga!&amp;#10;     Sculpted Doom Token: This is used to mark the province that will be destroyed next by Ragnar&amp;ouml;k, something that bloodthirsty Vikings can forget in the heat of battle. Designed by Adrian Smith, this token depicts the Triple Horn of Odin.&amp;#10;     Sculpted (Golden) First Player Token: With this token, you'll never forget who's supposed to start the round. It is a hand holding an axe up high.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2nd Edition came with some more upgraded components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Pillage Tokens: Engraved flat reward tokens and separate 3D pillaged provinces that fit on top of the reward token.&amp;#10;     Golden Gods of Asgard Miniatures: Resculpted, oversized, golden figure and card (same Gods as in &amp;quot;Gods of Asgard&amp;quot; expansion).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Further, an extra variant set of miniatures, the Wild Boar Clan (or Stag Clan), was included, allowing an expanded choice of clans. This was not, however, a fifth player expansion, as it lacked the needed cards (Stag Clan did include the 5th player cards). Included with the standard game components were the sculpted clan tokens and Mystic figures, making this forward compatible with the Mystics of Asgard expansion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Those who also purchased 5th Player Expansion during the campaign additionally received extra exclusives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
