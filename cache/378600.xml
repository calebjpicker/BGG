						               													<description>Resilience Survive and Thrive is a tabletop card game that aims to teach its players lessons on balanced development and natural resiliency under the climate change lens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round is divided into several phases: Draw, Activity, Impact, Community and Crisis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Draw phase, each player draws 2 cards from the Development deck. If the number of cards from the players' hands exceeds 7, they must discard the extra cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Activity phase, each player can do up to 3 activities. An Activity can be a combination of any of the following:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Restoring an Environment - turning over an environment card back to its position on the playmat.&amp;#10;     Playing an Investment - placing an Investment card from your hand into your community.&amp;#10;     Playing a House - placing any card facedown and sideways from your hand into your community. Houses are Gray Investments and give 1 Development Point (DP).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Apply Impact phase, players will specific impacts of the Investment cards they have placed onto the playmat. Different Investments have different impacts:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Sustainable Investments increase DPs depending on how sustainable its associated Environment is.&amp;#10;     Commercial Investment can destroy the environment, removing 1 Environment card from the playmat, but also gives the player 4 DP.&amp;#10;     Conservation Investment restore 1 particular Environment card but does not give any DP.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Community phase, players can play 1 Action card. If the player does not play an Action card, they can take 1 card from the Development deck instead or simply pass. Action cards are used to gain an upper hand against the player's opponents. Place the Action card into the discard pile once played. In this phase, players can also cast votes to close down one Investment at play. Voted Investments go into the discard pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lastly, in the Crisis phase, the top card is revealed and its effect applied.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     If the revealed Crisis is an Extreme Weather Event, players must determine its effect by counting the associated Environment, then apply the destruction to each community.&amp;#10;     If the revealed Crisis is an End Game Crisis, destroy all cards of the specific Environment type and place the End Game card on its slot in the playmat. The game continues as long as the 3 End Game slots are not yet occupied.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the crisis, return to the Draw phase to start a new round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
