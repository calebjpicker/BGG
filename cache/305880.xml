Shuffle all the cards (the prevention side face up) as a deck and place it in the middle of the table.&amp;#10;2. Leave two spaces as the &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;discard area&amp;rdquo; next to the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the Game:&amp;#10;Start with the start player. On player&amp;rsquo;s turn, he activates the following phases in order:&amp;#10;After a player activates &amp;ldquo;Epidemic Prevention and Spread Phase&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Epidemic Prevention Events Phase&amp;rdquo;, players take their turns in clockwise order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Epidemic Prevention and Spread Phase&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A. Epidemic Prevention&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#154;Player takes 3 cards from the top of the card deck, choose one with &amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#187;&amp;spades;/&amp;spades;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#189;and place it in any player&amp;rsquo;s area (include the player himself). Then player flips over the rest of two cards in the &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo; and check if there is an &amp;ldquo;outbreak&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;epidemic area&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Outbreak: After player activates &amp;ldquo;Epidemic Prevention&amp;rdquo; and there are the same infected cards in &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo;, the player must take two same infected cards from &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo; and place in his player area. Keep taking until infected cards are totally different in the &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;B. Spread: Take an infected card from the&amp;rdquo; infected area&amp;rdquo; and place it in his player area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.

Next, player flips the card over and places the card in &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo;. Keep activating every card until there is no more card with &amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#187;&amp;#226;&amp;#156;&amp;#154;&amp;#239;&amp;#188;&amp;#189;on the top of the deck.&amp;#10;After the player finished the phase1 and 2, the player&amp;rsquo;s turn end. The next player takes his turn in clockwise order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Transmission Events&amp;rdquo;: When all players take their turns, the round ends. Then whoever becomes a &amp;ldquo;confirmed case&amp;rdquo; must take a card which should be identical with the routes of infection of his own from the &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo; to his player area. (about &amp;ldquo;confirm case&amp;rdquo;: see the &amp;ldquo;Special Cases&amp;rdquo;)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The end of the game:&amp;#10; 1. When the card deck runs out, shuffle the cards of discard area as a new deck. Keep playing the card deck until the deck runs out again, then the game ends. Every player wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. If all player become &amp;ldquo;confirm case&amp;rdquo; or one player died before players run out the card deck twice, the game ends immediately, all players lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special Cases:&amp;#10;1. &amp;ldquo;confirm case&amp;rdquo;: When a player has more than 3 identical infected cards in his player area, he becomes the &amp;ldquo;confirm case&amp;rdquo; by that routes of infection. In the end of a round, because of the &amp;ldquo;Transmission Events&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;confirm case&amp;rdquo; has to take a card as same as his routes of infection. But there is no need to take any card if the &amp;ldquo;confirm case&amp;rdquo; has the corresponding epidemic prevention card or there is no same infected card in the &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. &amp;ldquo;death confirmed&amp;rdquo;: When a player has 5 identical infected cards in his player area, the game ends, everyone is failing to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and is lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. When a player activates &amp;ldquo;Epidemic Prevention&amp;rdquo; in his first phase(Epidemic Prevention and Spread Phase) and the 3 cards he draws are all with &amp;#226;&amp;#156;&amp;#154; or he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to take anyone back, he may flip over all the cards and place them in &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hospital&amp;#10;A Player who has a hospital card must take the treatment in hospital: he can discard an infected card from his player area every round; he won&amp;rsquo;t become a &amp;ldquo;confirmed case&amp;rdquo; or effect by &amp;ldquo;Transmission Events&amp;rdquo;. Before the player discard the hospital card, he can&amp;rsquo;t activate any action in Phase1. But the player should check if there is an &amp;ldquo;outbreak&amp;rdquo; in &amp;ldquo;epidemic area&amp;rdquo; as well. If there are more than 2 identical infected cards in &amp;ldquo;infected area&amp;rdquo;, the player has to take 2 cards of them and place them in his player area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
