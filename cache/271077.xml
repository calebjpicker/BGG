						               													<description>The Concept&amp;#10;   In the game, players will be commanding their robots using the cards given. The game starts with Instruction cards where we introduce basic commands in simple code. Slowly game moves to resource cards on which bigger code with generic syntax is written. Robots will be executing these codes sequentially just in the way computers execute programs. The cards are written in Java but readable as simple English.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Anyone who can read and understand English can easily read and follow these codes, thus making it easy for kids and adults to learn programming. There are complicated code cards which will be used in strategy level, which are explained well in the rule book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Story &amp;#10;   C.E.L.E.B (Command Executing Laser Equipped Bot) was developed by S.A.I.L (Secret Artificial Intelligence Lab) for military for war purposes. As the name says he can execute his human partner's commands and shoot enemies with the laser from his chest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a part of S.A.I.L's training program to choose the Commanding Officers for the bots, players are being tested against their logic and strategy in the artificial war zone. Shoot Cards will be distributed equally to all the players. First player starts the game by picking up the top card of Instructions deck and moves his robot according to the command on his Instruction card. If he gets to move to a new grid on the board using this card, he can collect the top card of Resources deck. When it is first players turn again he can choose between playing his resource and picking up a new instruction. As the game goes on, you will collect more resources and strategize your game better. As the robot moves on war zone it will collect important resource codes for it's partner which will help him strategize in the war. The player who reaches the middle of war zone first will be promoted as Commanding Officer. But you need to shoot at least one enemy robot before getting there.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components&amp;#10;  The game box contains&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- 1 Game board (AKA) War zone&amp;#10;    - A deck of Instruction Cards(codes)&amp;#10;    - A deck of Resource Cards&amp;#10;    - A deck of Shoot Cards&amp;#10;    - A rule book&amp;#10;    - 4 C.E.L.E.B game markers&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
