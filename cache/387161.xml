						               													<description>In Boil + Trouble, you and your friends play as witches, with the goal to snatch up and eat six children before the end of the thirteenth turn. Lure them to your Coven using magic spells and minions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Children are manipulated along Direct or Twisted paths. Direct paths are clear, but twisted paths turn and cross each other, and you don't always know where a twisted path leads.   &amp;quot;Heroes&amp;quot; are the antagonists of Boil + Trouble, who attempt to rescue children and kill your minions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has a unique book of spells which can manipulate the board. Players can throw ingredients into a shared cauldron to cast their magic, however, other players use the same cauldron, and the wrong combination of ingredients will limit your spellcasting ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
