						               													<description>In KEEP ROCK! all of the players are cavemen sitting around trying to be the player who collects the most points by hanging onto the unbroken ROCK, or by sticking the other players with the broken ROCK.  At the end when the draw pile is gone and no more cards can be played, the player with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CONTENTS: 10 &amp;ldquo;TAKE ROCK&amp;rdquo; cards, 10 &amp;ldquo;ME BREAK ROCK&amp;rdquo; cards, 10 &amp;ldquo;GIVE ROCK&amp;rdquo; cards, 8 &amp;ldquo;NO BREAK ROCK&amp;rdquo; cards, 14 &amp;ldquo;KEEP ROCK!&amp;rdquo; cards, 6 SCORE ROCK cards, 1 ROCK accessory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY: Take the SCORE ROCK cards and the ROCK out of the deck. Choose a dealer and deal 5 cards to each player. Now place the SCORE ROCK cards back into the deck, spaced at random intervals. The deck (as draw-pile) goes in the middle of the table w/ a discard pile next to it. The dealer starts with the ROCK (unbroken side-up) and goes first. Players each maintain a 5-card hand during play. On his turn a player must play 1 ACTION card and draw 1 card if possible; OR, he must pick one of the other players with whom to trade 2 cards in blind random fashion, and then he must pass his turn.  When an ACTION card is played, the player whom it is aimed at may play the appropriate REACTION card if he can, then draw 1 card if possible. When a SCORE ROCK card is revealed, points are scored if possible (described below). Then the SCORE ROCK card is discarded and play continues. All cards that are played go into the discard pile face-up. When a player&amp;rsquo;s turn is finished, the next player clockwise takes his turn, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SCORING: 1 &amp;ndash; When a SCORE ROCK card is revealed and a player has the unbroken ROCK, if possible he gets two cards from the discard pile as points; if only one is left, then just one. If no cards are in the discard pile, none are scored.  2 &amp;ndash; When a SCORE ROCK card is revealed and a player has the broken ROCK, each of the other players takes one card from the discard pile in clock-wise order relative to the player with the broken ROCK. If the discard pile runs out it&amp;rsquo;s just &amp;ldquo;tough cave luck.&amp;rdquo; If no cards are in the discard pile, no points are scored.  3 &amp;ndash; If a player has the unbroken ROCK at the end (when the draw pile is empty and no more cards can be played), that player collects 5 cards from the discard pile as points.  4 &amp;ndash; If a player has the broken ROCK at the end, each of the other players collects 1 card from the discard pile as points. Players each count the points (cards) in their own collection pile and the player with the most wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
