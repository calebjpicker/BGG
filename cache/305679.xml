						               													<description>This is a cooperative game where the goal is to finish the chosen scenario with every character alive (at least with 1 hit point left).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before playing, you must chose a scenario (there's also an option for custom game) by putting together 4 square pieces to make a square board and using tokens which will be used to accomplish the quest of the scenario.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of a scenario can be to find specific tiles or kill a specific enemy for example.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each colored emplacement of the board you put a tile face down. Tiles can be enemies, quest items, gold or bonuses. There also are shop tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player chose a character between Ruel, Evangeline, Yugo or Tristepin and take the corresponding card and figurine. Each card shows the character's hit points, inventory space, which dice they use to attack and defend (4, 6 or 8 faces). Each character also has a different set of tokens which represent which actions they can do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turn sequence is players play first, then monsters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a player's turn, each player secretly choose their 3 actions at the same time, then they reveal the 3 actions together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turn order is always the same : Ruel plays first, then it's Tristepin, Evangeline and Yugo last.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every player plays one action in this order until everyone has played their 3 actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions are : &amp;#10;- movement : When a character arrives on a quarter of the board, all the tiles of that quarter are turned face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- hand to hand or bow attack : to attack, the player rolls the corresponding dice as shown on their character's card. If it's higher than the monster's armor, the player wins and the monster tile is discarded and the player earns money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- spell : only yugo has the spell action which he can use to teleport.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- gift an item to someone (so they can heal or to have more room in the inventory)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When everyone has played their 3 actions it's the monsters' turn: Each player has a monster color, randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. Each player moves and makes an attack with the monster which is on a tile the color he has.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monsters always attack in the same way. Monsters who are on a red tile attacks Tristepin, yellow attack Ruel, green attack Evangeline and Blue attack Yugo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monsters attack the same way the players do. If the monsters are successful, the player attacked loses hit points on their character's card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continue this way until the scenario goal is reached (all the players win) or until one of the players has no more hit point (all the players lose).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Choose your favorite character and make a team ready to fight the terrible Bouftous.&amp;#10;Together, Tristepin, Yugo, Evangelyne and Ruel will overcome thrilling quests!&amp;#10;Your missions? Find Ruel's lost Kamas, avoid Miss Moches' kisses or hunt Bouftous. If you need a better equipement, visit Kabrok the shoppkeeper.&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Wakfu, le jeu d'aventure&amp;quot; is a cooperative game where all the players fight, win together and share the loot.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
