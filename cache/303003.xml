						               													<description>The Imposter Kings is a 2-4 player card game designed to be quick to pick up, yet challenging to master. A typical round takes around 10-20 minutes, depending on the number of players and experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each card has a value in your hand (1-9), and you can typically only play cards of equal or higher value. It's not often a straightforward path from 1 to 9, so the real strategy comes from knowing what cards can best counter your best opponent, and secure your place on the Throne. For example:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Assassin has a low value of 2. But as a trained killer, she immediately can assassinate any King she can find. Thankfully, there are other cards to help, such as the King's Hand (by stepping in the way) or Inquisitor (who can preemptively force the Assassin out of the darkness with a pointed finger).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Soldier has a middle of the pack value of 5. They tirelessly fight for the King throughout their lives, and now they're confused to which King to serve. If they follow their leads and prove their suspicions, they grow more potent on the Throne.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Queen/Princess sits comfortably in the upper echelon of society with the highest value of 9. They push around all members of the Court with their thoughts, and very few can stand up to them. However, characters like the Elder (value 3) can remind the Court that no one is above the law. Or perhaps an Oathbound (value 6) will step up to the Throne. These mysterious beings are the Kingdom's most revered members and may brush anyone aside to share their agenda. And of course, the King can always take matters into his own hands...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fight viciously with your allies! Bluff and deceive others about what you may have! Assassinate all that stand in your way! Foil plans by forcing your opponents hand! There are a fantastic amount of possibilities, and you have to try to fulfill your objective while hindering others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
