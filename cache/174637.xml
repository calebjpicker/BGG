						               													<description>Prepare yourself for the bizarre as you venture deep into a world of radioactive insanity!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wasteman: A game of desperate conflicts in a desolate future! A frantic game, set amongst the ruins of a neglected and scorched earth. Engage in desperate battles between post-humans, hideous monstrosities and killer robots over the dregs of an age of gluttony. Take control of you own syndicate and test your metal against the weird and terrifying denizens of the wastes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wasteman is a fun, easy to learn, and refreshingly crazy game! Players or 'comrades' control syndicates, typically comprised of between 5 and 20 ruthless denizens of the wastes, in an attempt to vanquish their opponent, survive bizarre encounters and/or capture much needed supplies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a game of Wasteman, comrades take it turn to activate individual figures to perform several actions; such as attacking, moving, hiding or even bringing people back to life with the power of their mind in some cases! Figures can normally only be activated once per turn so you have real scope for strategy &amp;ndash; goad your opponent into activating the wrong figure at the wrong time and they could be left open to all sorts of cunning shenanigans!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a syndicate drops below 5 figures they become desperate and the restriction for activating a figure only once in a turn is lifted. This leads to some really cinematic moments, where often lone survivors hopelessly attempt to fend off hordes of enemies and occasionally succeed! This really keeps the game fun right until the last man.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Figures take different kinds of damage &amp;ndash; they can be spooked, crippled, seriously injured, or killed outright. To make it easier to remember what&amp;rsquo;s happened, each figure comes with a base equipped with slots and removable tokens. These are cast in high quality resin and are included with all but the largest figures. Each figure will receive 1 base out of 10 designs selected at random.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;M.A.D cards really bring the crazy to the game! Each comrade receives a hand of 5 M.A.D cards that can be played at any time (for the most part) to either help yourself or hinder your opponent. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like having the enemy boss abducted by aliens just before riding a conveniently timed tornado to the objective on the last turn! Though normally limited to 5 cards, you can seek the aid of traders or vending machines to top up your hand during a game leading to some very tense moment as your prize fighter sits in the middle of the battlefield kicking a coffee machine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards themselves are lavishly illustrated by yours truly, and beautifully printed on quality playing card stock.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As well as a myriad of rules for hazards, mods to alter the game and a stockpile of scenarios, Wasteman has an in depth syndicate creation system, with loads of equipment, skills and Boss Rosters to choose from. Although each figure comes with a stat card, you are more than welcome to create your own and/or combine figures from different posse packs &amp;ndash; the choices are vast!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wasteman miniatures are sculpted by hand to approximately 35mm scale and will be cast in metal, unless specified to the contrary. All figures will come with stat cards and token slot bases. They will be supplied unpainted and, in some cases, unassembled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
