						               													<description>Mythos: Vengeance of Ognyan is a combat-driven and strategy dependent RPG board game. It follows the steps of three heroes, who set out to slay a legendary Zmey, who has risen from the grave. Vengeance of Ognyan is a core-set and includes everything you need to play in a total of 4 game modes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the Vengeance of Ognyan campaign, players will be able to pick one of three available heroes to venture out alone or in a party with one goal: to slay Ognyan once and for all. Each character has their own mechanics and relations to the others. Every one of them has their own die, stats and skill trees. During turns, players will have a chance to move and then initiate combat, but dice will determine the success of their announced actions. Positioning also plays a large part of strategizing your way to victory: while standing next to specific characters, you gain different buffs or debuffs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the Campaign players will follow open-ended quest-lines, which can lead them through different routes to victory or failure. Each quest is tied to a location and a setup. Every location has its own rule set. You place your heroes, arrange the enemies and proceed with combat until you achieve victory. That can mean different things, depending on your current quest goal - like slaying all enemies or surviving an onslaught for a given number of turns. During a campaign run, players will have to complete numerous encounters, cleanse dungeons and participate in many events before the party reaches Ognyan&amp;rsquo;s Lair. You can also invite a more experienced fourth player to join you and act as your guide through the world of Mythos, but if you do &amp;ndash; their word becomes the law of the game, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s fun for everyone!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With every battle, the heroes grow stronger through a leveling system. If a player can bank enough experience tokens, their hero can level up. The player will have to choose one of two available skill options and with each choice their hero will become a unique result of their play through. But watch out &amp;ndash; enemies gain levels proportionally to the party as well!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After you've mastered the game's rules and mechanics, you can try one of the other game modes present: Ognyan Unleashed, RNG Challenges and Player versus Player Combat are there for more experienced adventurers or those, who are looking for a fast battle without context. Better yet - now that you have these tools at your disposal, you can design your very own epic adventures and share them with the Ognyan Slayers community for a chance to win awesome rewards!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The World of Mythos awaits you. It's time you rise and put an end to Ognyan's tyrannical reign once and for all!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can have a look at the Mythos: Vengeance of Ognyan public rule book here: http://1am.studio/Mythos-Vengeance_of_Ognyan_DigitalRulebook.pdf&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    The Vengeance of Ognyan core-set is the based on the &amp;quot;Mythos&amp;quot; franchise by 1AM Studios, which is inspired by ancient Slavic mythology.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
