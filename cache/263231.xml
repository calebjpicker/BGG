						               													<description>Reveal is a Fun and Sexy Adult Board Game centered around sexuality and Kinks that you can play with friends, whatever type of Relationship you have with them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reveal is designed to fit 4 type of players: From the ones that just want to have a good laugh to people in the Lifestyle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However you want to play Reveal, you choose the Level at the beginning and The Game will adapt to it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is casual like Cards against Humanity or other similar game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any player can end the game, by collecting enough points to call an exit but what we noticed is that players in fact play until the cards rotate enough to go back to the same questions again. It's rare to see someone who quits Reveal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game has 8 set of cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     4 Set of questions with hidden point, strip and Joker cards&amp;#10;     4 Set of Dares&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 4 set of questions are Experience, Opinion, Intimacy and Fantasy.&amp;#10;The 4 Set of Dares are in fact 4 level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You spin a wheel at the center of the board when it is your turn, to determinate which category you will  have to pick a question from.&amp;#10;Whatever category you end up during your turn, you can get a question, a joker (counter card), a Strip card (optional) or a Point cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Question are cards you need to answer. You will be judge by the other participants on your answer. If half of them judge that your answer is not satisfactory, then you have to put back one of your point card or Joker card in the pile of card.&amp;#10;     Point card are collected to buy a dare to impose on anyone - when you have enough of them.&amp;#10;     Strip card if used, request you to remove a piece of cloth.&amp;#10;     Joker card enable you to counter a question, a dare or a strip card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Choose Your Level Before Playing&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is 4 ways to play Reveal: from casual to progressively sexual charged.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you play level 1 of the game (to play with any type of friends OK to talk about kinks and sex). You will only be able to access the Dares from level 1 that you can purchase with the points you collect randomly as you pick up a card during your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you play level 2, only dare level 1 and 2 will be accessible, making the dare a little bit more provocative but still playable with friends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At level 3, level 1,2 and 3 of the Dares are accessible. Now we are talking about Dares including 2 participants. So everyone need to be comfortable with that.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At least, level 4 includes all the dares. this last Level will make the game sexual and is designed for people in the Lifestyle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Depending of the Level you choose to play, it will be more or less easy to counter dares and Strip cards. As you can imagine, at level 1, it takes some points to buy a Dare but it's easy to counter it.&amp;#10;At level 4, it is the opposite: Dares are easily purchase with points but hard to counter with Joker.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Strip cards can be completely removed from the game before starting. It doesn't change the fun of the playing Reveal. It just a choice you make to have people losing their Joker faster or not countering Strip cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designers&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
