						               													<description>Battlesuit: Heavy Metal is a tactical level game of man-to-man combat in a dark future. Players manage a squad or full platoon of heavily armed and armored soldiers as they navigate through blasted terrain to accomplish their mission. This could be to capture or hold terrain, break through the enemy lines, or simply destroy enemy soldiers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each soldier is tracked with his or her own data card, allowing the capabilities of each to be hidden until engaged. Ten different soldier types, each with its own abilities can be selected as part of a squad, through ten different scenarios across ten different tabloid-sized (11x17 inch) geomorphic maps, allowing for hundreds of different battlefield configurations. An included &amp;ldquo;design-your-own&amp;rdquo; system makes it easy to create your own scenarios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also included are guidelines on how to play Battlesuit: Heavy Metal using miniatures, either with or without the map sheets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players who have been around long enough may recognize this game as a redesign of Battlesuit from Steve Jackson Games. This does in fact take that classic as an inspiration, while greatly updating it with new mechanics to both simplify and provide a lot more flexibility toward creating your own scenarios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fire your powered armor, heat up your weapon pack, and prepare for mayhem in the wasteland with Battlesuit: Heavy Metal!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
