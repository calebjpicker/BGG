You run your own protest group NO!  NEVER! ACTION! NOW! STOP! OR NIMBY! Be the first to get 20 protest points and become a LOCAL HERO! by making your community a better place!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Based in a fictional local community, You lead your own protest group and each turn try to run the City! Each player competes to fill City Hall with their supporters and stay in control of the mob (the other players).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who runs the City Hall is City Leader! There can only ever be one Leader, so staying in control of the City means learning the rules and using them to your advantage!  If no one player dominates City Hall then deals have to be done and undone between players about who stays in power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn players move around the board along the green belt as they protest to improve their city and have to make decisions about which other players they support. Decisions are made on the basis of facts, feelings and trust, reasoned argument or power play and determined by the number of cards players have in City Hall.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn can change the number of cards a player has and so alter their influence. Players have to manoeuvre themselves between seeking power and staying true to their cause until one player has gained 20 protest points and becomes the LOCAL HERO! Points are gained by taking control of the City, time served as Leader and from doing deals with other players to get their support.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This leads to a fast paced game, players are constantly changing sides, working out who best to support, and not being corrupt. It is an exhausting game of wit, strategy, coercion and survival that brings out the best and the worst in participants!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end you don't just win you make the World a better place! and had an exciting evenings entertainment with family and friends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
