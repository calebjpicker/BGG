						               													<description>Masterwork&amp;#10;A beautiful game of creating prestigious artworks&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Masterwork, players are artists struggling to win prestige by creating famous artworks and participating in gallery exhibitions. Collect pigments to craft brilliant paints and use those paints to paint the greatest artworks of the High Renaissance. Get critiqued, build your portfolio, and exhibit your work to become the most prestigious artist of the period!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's your turn&amp;#10;On your turn, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t started an artwork, you may select one from the gallery and move it to your easel, indicating that artwork is in progress. Now, only you can complete it. Next, use sets of pigments from your hand to produce paint, discarding the requisite cards indicated in the recipe area on the paint card. Move your new paint from the palette to your hand or place it on your easel, dedicating it to that artwork.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each artwork requires a specific set of paints. When you have gathered them, in hand or on the easel, it&amp;rsquo;s time to submit your artwork for a critique. Roll the critique die; if the value of equal or higher to the prestige value of the artwork, you have successfully completed it! Move the artwork, along with all paints used to complete it, to the table, clearing your easel for your next artwork. If your roll came up short, take a feedback token indicating you&amp;rsquo;ve received useful advice from the critique. This token makes future critique attempts easier. Each subsequent artwork makes future critiques easier, representing the artist&amp;rsquo;s growing popularity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All 24 artwork cards award prestige points, with addition prestige earned by participating in exhibitions. Exhibits award prestige points when players complete sets of artwork cards; such as: &amp;lsquo;Leonardo Exhibit&amp;rsquo; (two artworks from Leonardo da Vinci) and &amp;lsquo;Portrait Exhibit&amp;rsquo; (artworks featuring portrait images). Masterwork includes 16 exhibit cards, with a random set of three used each game, offering a great deal of replayability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mixing colors&amp;#10;Pairs of primary color (Red, Yellow, Blue) cards may mix to be played as a secondary card of the same type. Secondary colors (Orange, Green, Violet) and different card types (Pigment and Paint cards) do not mix. Mixing colors gives you creative options when producing Pigment and Paint cards. Remember: you must always mix the same type (Paint with Paint, etc.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending and scoring&amp;#10;When a player completes a gold-edged Masterwork Artwork card, finish the current round so each player has an equal number of turns (the player to the right of the starting player gets the final play). Each player adds up the Prestige Points from their completed Artwork cards. The three Exhibit cards are evaluated one after another for each player, comparing their completed Artwork cards with the requirements of cards. For each completed Exhibit card, add the indicated Prestige Point value to the Player&amp;rsquo;s total. The player with the most Prestige Points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
