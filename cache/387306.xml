						               													<description>&amp;quot;The sheer horror when you find out Waitrose has just run out of avocados again... or when your wifi's only on 1 bar. These are just some of the terrifying and hilarious situations you will encounter in this card game.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game contains 400 yellow answer cards and 100 black question cards. Each player is dealt 10 yellowcards. A &amp;quot;Card Master&amp;quot; is selected who picks a balck card and reads the question. Each other player selects one of their yellow cards and gives it face down to the Card Master who shuffles them and reads them out. They then select the they find funniest or most tragic and the player that submitted it takes the black card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The role of Card Master then passes to the left of the previous one and the process is repeated until a predetermined score is reached or everyon has had enough. The player who has accumulated the most black cards is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
