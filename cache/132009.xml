						               													<description>Welcome to the dystopian future of The Chronicles of Abakan: The Titan Campaigns, a new board game based on the visually stunning and evocative world imagined by the brilliant international sculptor and painter, Luca Zampriolo. Set in a resource-starved future, The Chronicles of Abakan centers around a world controlled by dynastic corporate families who rule through an apex of technology: HDMs (Hard Doll Machines), powerful mechas that serve as both industrial laborers and military enforcers.&amp;#10; The most powerful of these families is House Weingart, a tyrannical and fascist regime whose monopoly over advanced HDM technologies and, most importantly, the super-efficient refined fuel known as &amp;ldquo;Wein,&amp;rdquo; has granted them a long-standing and unchallenged authority&amp;hellip;&amp;#10; &amp;hellip;until now.&amp;#10; Deep in the solar system, where Wein is fueled on distant planets, the colony of Terra Nova has rebelled. Hailing mostly from North America, the Neo-Terrans have summoned the revolutionary spirit of their ancestors and successfully repulsed their Weingart overlords, and now an interplanetary Civil War has begun.&amp;#10; The Chronicles of Abakan is a world of mercenaries and warlords, of bounty hunters and generals, and revolutionaries and military soldiers. Where HDMs drop from transport ships high in orbit around distant planets to do battle on strange and alien terrains, from the crumbling streets of New York City to the frozen tundras of Saturn&amp;rsquo;s moon Titan, and beyond.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So join in on the strategic and tactical boardgame pitting players against one another in an attempt to secure their dominion or their freedom in a merciless civil war set in humanity&amp;rsquo;s grim future. The Titan Campaigns chronicle the early years of the Neo-Terrans&amp;rsquo; revolution, where players battle for control of resource giving holdings in the Novan Sector, near Saturn. Moons, asteroids, and space stations serve as the battlegrounds, and players maneuver against each other by moving their fleets around the Campaign Map, building up shipyards, factories, and refineries and balancing their resources with expansion and military might.&amp;#10; When battle is engaged, players move to tile-based battlegrounds, pitting their HDMs (Hard Doll Machines)&amp;ndash;giant weaponized mechs&amp;ndash;against one another. These miniatures are based on Luca Zampriolo&amp;rsquo;s original designs, and the models themselves are sculpted by Luca Zampriolo himself, as well as Filippo Zanicotti of Dust Tactics fame. When a player conquers his opponent&amp;rsquo;s holding, he adds it to his own, thus increasing his 4 Resources: Labor, Oil, Iron, and Wein until only one player is left standing.&amp;#10; The board game is set to have two factions: The oppressive Weingart Dynasty and the Neo-Terrans--choose your side today!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
