						               													<description>Wallis's Picturesque Round Game of the Produce and Manufactures of the Counties of England and Wales was first published between 1826 and 1837 according to F.R.B. Whitehouse in Table Games (pg. 17). It was kept in print into the 1840s by John Passmore.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board was a pictorial map of England and Wales, with each space defined by accurately-shaped county boundaries. Race from start of the Thames to City of London in 151 stops - with each county having a number of pictorial representations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;According to Whitehouse it was published by Edward Wallis, 42, Skinner Street&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the later 1850 edition:&amp;#10;This is a geographical race game played on a map of England and Wales. The boardgame is divided into counties with representations of local landmarks and industry. There are 151 playing spaces. The play is a circular one, with the starting space at the River Thames and the end space in London.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players are provided with a Card, containing nine Letters, nine Numbers, two Crosses and one Blank, which are to be cut up on the lines with a pair of scissors. The letters are to be distributed one to each player, according to the number about to play, and the remainder laid aside. They are used to mark each player's position o the Game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player, on drawing a number, is to place his letter on the same number in the Game, and read the description aloud. When it is his turn to draw another, he adds them together and advances his letter to that number which they make when so added, reading as before, and observing any directions which may be given him. But if he draw a cross, he is to draw again, till he obtain a number, which number is to be deducted from, instead of added to his former station, and his letter moved back accordingly. Each card to be returned to the bag after drawing. Whoever draws a blank, remains at his former number. After each player has drawn once, the Game is to be continued in the same manner, passing the bag round, till some one makes up the exact number 151, who wins the Game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The details of the boardgame reveal the date of the Great Fire of Plymouth, October 1840 and the land slide at Lyme Regis of 1839.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
