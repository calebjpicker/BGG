						               													<description>After the exile of MEDUSA in a distance, the gods POSEIDON and ATHENS stood between them and fought a new competition to discover which of the two island is the most acclaimed god in Greece. So ask for the help of the god DION&amp;Iacute;SIUS and together they created a THEATER FESTIVAL to mark the beginning of winter entitled OSCHOPHORIA.&amp;#10;     They invited the greatest artistic producers in Greece to represent them and thus, PRODUCE a GREAT THEATER SHOW. And for this dispute to become more fierce, the gods create an unquestionable rule: 'THE SCENARIO used in productions must contain perfect sculptures'. And for that, it will be necessary that NOBLE ACTORS SACRIFICE themselves in great pose and style, facing MEDUSA on their island to be PETRIFIED. And later these statues must be RESCUE and linked to the great show.&amp;#10;      Other gods would also like to participate in this event helping producers with specific powers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You'll have up to 15 turns to create the best show. At the beginning of the game, you must choose whether to defend the interests of Athena or Poseidon. Your choice will determine which benefits you get at the start of the game. The game will have a maximum of 15 turns, which may decrease depending on the perks earned during the match. Managing your time during the match will be essential to build the minimum necessary to score. At the end of the game, the player must have the minimum necessary to count the points.&amp;#10;Each player will have four meeples to move around the board, collecting resources distributed in nine factories. You will also be able to collect cast cards, mask cards and also petrified statues on the island of &amp;quot;MEDUSA&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The roll of the dice will serve to create the resources in the factories and also to make the movement of the four producers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To take an actor to the island of &amp;quot;MEDUSA&amp;quot;, just enter with your meeple in the place destined for this. And to rescue a statue of your petrified actor, the player must have another actor hired and also a mask activated. To hire actors and activate masks it will be necessary to allocate the correct components to each card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the board there is a space for market transactions between players. And some houses of movement, called squares of Dionysus. When stopping at these squares, the player will receive resources in gold. With this gold you can offer and receive help from other gods. Every time the player receives 3 gold, he must advance one turn on his turn track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when the first player reaches the &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; square on the turn track. And the winning player will be the one who scores the most points with their hired squad cards, rescued statues and resource filling on their individual show sheet (chosen at the beginning of the game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The sum of this score will show which player manages to perform the best show in honor of the chosen god. And if there is a tie, art always wins and all players share the victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
