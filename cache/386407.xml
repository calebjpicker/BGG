						               													<description>BONN TOUR - on the road in the federal capital - is a dice game for 3 to 6 players. The players have the exciting task of guiding a small group of visitors through the federal capital on foot, by bus, by S-Bahn or U-Bahn and by boat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 4 different movement options, which are always done with a die. There are question fields on the game board where a question card is drawn that has to be answered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning, each player draws 3 destination cards.
