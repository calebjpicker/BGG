						               													<description>Each player will contribute to creating the graph (Candelsticks) of one (or more) quoted Financial Instrument, by playing cards from his hand. In his turn, the player can also decide to open or close positions, betting on the rise or fall of the Financial Instrument. The player will earn from the difference between the price at which he opened the position and the price at which he closes the position. &amp;#10;It is essential to study the intentions of the opponents and hinder them while trying to position themselves strategically. Some Money Management cards help you to better manage your positions and hinder your opponents with the typical dynamics of drawing cards, having them discarded, spying or playing out of your turn. &amp;#10;Attention instead to the Event cards that once drawn are activated and can upset the market (and the wallet of those who have risked too much). Of course, whoever earns the most wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is designed to have an elementary basic development that mirrors the development on the market of a financial instrument. The player is led to make delicate choices based on market trends, dealing with an emotional state and risk management that are typical of real operations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this sense, the game is designed so that statistically the rise in prices is slower than the relative descents (you go up the stairs and go down with the elevator). At the same time it will never be possible to know in a game, if you are in a bear market or a bull market as some random cards are removed from the deck at each game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The entire game is designed to give food for thought and teaching. The possibility of comparison is in fact a competitive advantage that very often people in the financial world do not use due to the difficulty of dealing with such delicate issues as personal investments.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The possibility of comparison is continuously solicited by combining different financial instruments and players with market situations and risk appetites that are different for each of us.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
