						               													<description>Kalypto is a fast-paced easy to learn quick two player card game. With a second copy of the game, you can make a bigger deck to play with more players, but you start with seven cards instead of five.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Kalypto, players try to eliminate each other using armies of shadows. In the box you get shadows with a strength from 1 to 10 (4 of each number), action cards like seize, extort, rise and devour (4 of each) and one very powerful candle card. To set up, shuffle the deck and deal out five cards to each player and place the deck in the center. Each player chooses at least one shadow and places it face down in front of him, this is the start of Their army. If you run out of cards in your army or hand, you lose the game. You are now ready to battle!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you choose two actions to perform between four possibilities: you can draw a card from the deck and add it to your hand, you can summon a shadow from your hand that you add to your army, you can use a power card from your hand and place it in the discard pile or you can choose one of your shadows and an opponent shadow! Reveal both cards and the lowest number is sent in the discard pile. If they are the same, they are both discarded. Each action can only be done once per turn. When you've done two of these actions, your turn ends and the next player begins his turn. There are four action cards that are self explanatory: seize makes you steal one enemy shadow and add it to your army face up; Extort allows you to steal a random card from an enemy and add it to your hand; Rise allows you to draw two cards or make your opponent draw two cards (but be careful! If a player has more than seven cards in his hand, he loses!); And finally, devour allows you to choose 1 card from an enemy hand or army and discard it (which is called the pit). The candle card always matches the power of the shadow it fight, and if a player steal this card, he loses the game! If a player draws more cards than there is in the deck, he loses! Play goes like that until there is a winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
