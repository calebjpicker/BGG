						               													<description>Talenticity - The Art-Battle with Visual Magic!&amp;#10;A competitive tactical 2-4 players board game in which players compete for territory, make Moneye (the official currency of Talenticity), collect artifacts and become the superstar!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Talenticity is a mix of a strategy and tactical board game. Explore the Talenticity field with your hero, perform, run shows and conquer the city. And meanwhile: watch out for other artists, they want this city too!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts with random hero and god cards distribution, each player picks a faced down card of a hero and a god.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players receive their Hero miniatures and their performance miniatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player rolls the dices, the one with the biggest outcome starts the game. Then the order goes in a clockwise direction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of every day, all players take a piece of the Skies in order and use their God's eye to see the hidden image. The first player to take a piece of the Skies changes in a clockwise direction every new day. The Players should take and put the skies back one by one in a clockwise direction as well. Each player puts the Skies part back anywhere they want and tries to remember that location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is possible to compete in the sky too! Players can follow who saw which sky and take it to change its position on the next day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players' Turn:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player takes a show card from the deck at the start of his/her turn. Each player can have only 3 show cards in hand. Each turn player can take a show card from the deck or put one show card back under the deck of shows.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player rolls the dices and uses the Action Points*:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 AP for movement on the board&amp;#10;2 AP to place a performance mini around the hero miniatures&amp;#10;3 AP to perform a show. &amp;#10;4 AP to knock out another players performance miniature&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     - The Players do not have to use all the action points that they have every turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players can offer to trade or sell shows and artifact cards to other players during their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To perform a show, the player has to have 3 performance miniatures around the picked location. Then the player has to show the other players the piece of the skies that gives the blessing to perform a show in this location. If the player fails to show the correct sky piece, the show is canceled. The player takes back all three performance miniatures around that location and receives no Moneye. If the show is successful, then the player receives that location card + Moneye according to the show card + any combos.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For placing a performance miniature on the playing field, the player earns 1 Moneye.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player doubles double the Moneye earned from a show that matches the player's god.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player gets +2 extra Moneye if he or she performs the show in a matching location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After performing a show, if unused action points remain, the player can use them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To receive an artifact the player must show a combination of 3 Moneye that read the artifact name.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is not allowed to combo artifacts in one turn. Each artifact can only be used once in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when one of the players performs 5 shows (6 shows for 2&amp;amp;3 players).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The richest player wins the Art-Battle!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
