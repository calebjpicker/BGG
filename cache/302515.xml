						               													<description>Fighting Hives on a planet of Insects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nothing says victory like eating your opponents remains for lunch. Who needs zombies, when you got bugs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is made up of two 8.5x11 squared game sheets, each of which has a grid of offset squares on them.  These squares regulate movement and attacks by insects on other insects.  The game mats can be placed side by side, end to end, or can have a series of &amp;ldquo;bridges&amp;rdquo; that allows them to represent restricted spots that the insects are limited in crossing at.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO START THE GAME:&amp;#10;1. Both players roll one die, the highest goes first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. The first player places his hive anywhere on the game board marked in his own color.(Typically the closer the hive is placed toward the enemy player game board, the shorter the game will be).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. The second player then places his hive, and all of his starting game pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. The first player then places his game pieces and the game begins with the first player making his moves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SEQUENCE OF A TURN:&amp;#10;1. First a player moves one or more of his colors game pieces&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Then he attacks with a single game piece, however this does not have to be a game piece that was moved, it can be any pieces of his color/side. Continue to make attacks, one at a time,with as many of the attacker game pieces that are allowed to attack.  Each game piece can attack only once per turn. The attacking player can make the attacks in any order. A defender game piece that survives an attack can immediately counterattack against the attacker game piece, or another that is within range of being attacked. This must be done before the next attack is made by the attacking side. The attacking side must give the defender time to make the defenders counterattack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. The player then adds a game piece (reinforcement) to the hive entrance (if appropriate) for every food piece returned to the hive during the movement phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues until one of the following occurs.&amp;#10;1. A hive is destroyed. This happens when an enemy WORKER is next to the hive, and rolls a 6 on an attack. The hive is then destroyed.&amp;#10;2. All enemy game pieces are destroyed&amp;#10;3. One side gives up and concedes the game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
