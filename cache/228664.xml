						               													<description>A card and board game for 2-6 players in which each player takes the role of a Demon Hunter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board depicts Europe in the late 1800s. 20 cities are marked on the board, with each city connected to 1-4 other nearby cities.  Some cities may have an effect on die rolls or creature capabilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 3 decks: &amp;#10;-   The Character Deck represents advantageous traits that the characters start the game with.&amp;#10;The Research Deck comprises cards aid that aid the Demon Hunters in their quest. Players acquire these during play. Card types include: Events, Spells, Weapons, Armour, Items, and Companions. &amp;#10;-   The Creature Deck need to be small to fit easily on the map and represent the creatures that can be found in the various cities. Creatures have a strength and a victory point score (earned by defeating them)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with 5 Hits. Each player draws and keeps 5 character cards.  Each player rolls 1D20 to determine their starting City. &amp;#10;Randomly distribute the X top cards of the creature deck to random cities, where X = the number of players. (Max Monsters in any one city at start is 2)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns with each turn having 4 Phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.  Destiny Phase&amp;#10;-   The current player draws the top research card from the deck and places it in his hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.  Evil Phase&amp;#10;-   For each player roll 1D6: on a roll of 4+ flip over the top card of the creature deck and for each new creature roll 1D20.  Place the creature on the indicated City.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3.  Action Phase&amp;#10;-   The Current player may take 2 actions. There are 6 possible actions: &amp;#10;1.  Rest Action - Roll on a healing table to heal any hit points lost.&amp;#10;2.  Travel Action &amp;ndash; Roll on a movement table to move 0-2 spaces.&amp;#10;3.  Search Action &amp;ndash; Roll on a search table to determine whether you can find a creature to fight.&amp;#10;4.  Recruit Action - Put one Weapon, Item, Armour, or Companion card into play. A character can only have a maximum of 1 armour card, 2 weapon cards and 2 companion cards in Play&amp;#10;5.  Research Action - Roll on a research table and draw 0-3 research cards from the deck and put them in your hand. (You may do a max of 1 research action per turn)&amp;#10;6.  Trade Action - If you are in the same city as 1 or more other Demon Hunters, you may trade resource cards, in hand or in play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.  Fate Phase &amp;#10;-   Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess. &amp;#10;-   If at the end of a turn, any city has 5 or more creatures, it is &amp;#10;overrun and all players lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When fighting creatures roll 1D20 (The Battle Roll) and add any force bonuses you might have. If this number is equal to or greater than the strength of the creature you defeat it. Place defeated creatures in your victory pile. &amp;#10;If your modified roll was less, the creature remains in play and roll on the Wound Table taking damage accordingly. If you are reduced to zero Hits skip your next turn and return to play with just 1 hit. &amp;#10;If after losing a battle roll, you still have hits you may decide to either &amp;#10;continue the combat or flee. If you decide to continue, make another battle roll against the same creature. If you decide to flee, you may stay in the city or move 1 space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends at the end of the turn the creature deck has been exhausted. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
