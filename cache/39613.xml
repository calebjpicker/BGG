						               													<description>A manqala game. From http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Sat-gol:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Sat-gol was described by Professor Hem Chandra Das Gupta. He was the first Indian full-time Professor of Geology at Presidency College, Founder of Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Society and Geological Institute. &amp;#10;The information about sat-gol comes from the village of Gosalpur, in the Jubbulpur district, Central Provinces. &amp;#10;Nowadays Gosalpur is in the Jabalpur district of Madhya Praddesh, in North Central India. &amp;#10;No cultural background is given.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is made of seven circles (note that he doesn't say &amp;quot;holes&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;circles&amp;quot;) arranged in a circle. &amp;#10;At the beginning, there are four stones in each circle. &amp;#10;On your turn you take all the pieces from any circle and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each circle. When you have sown all the pieces on your hand, you take the ones in the next circle and keep on sowing with them. &amp;#10;The turn ends when the last stone is dropped in a circle which is followed by an empty one. &amp;#10;If the empty circle is followed by an occupied one, its contents are captured. &amp;#10;According to the original description it is not permitted to choose the hole from which the move begins. You must take the first non-empty hole after the hole where the opponent finished her last move. This would lead to a single game that would be played exactly the same all the time. V&amp;iacute;ktor Bautista i Roca therefore suggested: &amp;#10;     You can choose from which hole the sowing is started. &amp;#10;     The game ends when both players agree that it is impossible to capture more pieces and the remaining stones are not counted. &amp;#10;According to Murray's misinterpretation of Das Gupta's description &amp;quot;the player captures the contents of the hole beyond, or if there is a sequence of empty holes, the contents of the first loaded hole&amp;quot;. Das Gupta says, clearly, &amp;quot;he will be in possession of the pieces lying within the circle immediately next to the latter&amp;quot;. &amp;#10;The player who captures more pieces wins the game.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
