						               													<description>BENEATH - an underground adventure for 1-4 dwarves (2-4 players with the core game)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A board game of sometimes-cooperative mining and mayhem in a quest to restore the Dwarven Kingdom. 1-4 players, 60 min. per player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Beneath players take on the roles of brave but ruthless Dwarves seeking untold riches and the crown of the Dwarven Kingdom. Mining, trapping, stealing and fighting through the uncharted passages beneath the city of Stonewatch, players race to be the first to find the legendary King&amp;rsquo;s Gift, a vein of ore so valuable the Dwarf that finds it will be crowned ruler of all the Dwarves, if they can survive both the monsters and their own colleagues...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Only time will tell if you have what it takes to survive what lies beneath.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beneath is easy to set up. Each dwarf has a unique player board to track their equipment and abilities. Each scenario map in the campaign shows exactly how to set up the challenges your dwarves will face, creating a uniquely 3D board for each step of your adventure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once players select their Dwarves, each with unique abilities, they can further personalise their strategy by purchasing weapons, items and skills from their local merchant. Whether you prefer your treasure hacked from the lifeless bodies of your enemies, or thieved from the pockets of your fellow Dwarves, Beneath lets you Dwarf the way you want to Dwarf.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fully equipped, players they take turns as they journey through the mines, digging through rock and ancient granite, searching for treasure that all Dwarves crave and monsters to slay. A streamlined skills system keeps play dynamic and exciting whilst allowing incredible breadth in how your particular dwarf faces the dangers below.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But what good is treasure if you&amp;rsquo;re not alive to spend it? Each foray into the world of Beneath is also a race to find your way back out and do so with pieces of ancient scroll that show the way to the King&amp;rsquo;s Gift.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With enough pieces of scroll any dwarf will win the game, but there&amp;rsquo;s no honour among dwarves in the dark catacombs, and no crown for second place. Pinching those pieces of scroll from each other? &amp;lsquo;Accidentally&amp;rsquo; blowing up your fellow miners, blocking the exit to tie your shoelaces whilst your friend is slowly devoured by a colossal tremor worm? First rule of mining &amp;ndash; they can&amp;rsquo;t submit a formal complaint if they&amp;rsquo;re inside a giant worm. This is semi-cooperative dungeon crawling at its most semi.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With enough pieces of scroll any dwarf will win the game, but there&amp;rsquo;s no honour among dwarves in the dark catacombs, and no crown for second place.
