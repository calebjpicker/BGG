						               													<description>User Summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Based on the game from the original Battlestar Galactica television series. Game play is similar to that of Poker. The deck consists of 56 cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     52 Pyramid cards (divided into 4 suits - red, green, black, brown)&amp;#10;     4 Cylon cards (similar to Jokers)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The value of the cards are determined by a symbol system of dots, lines, and triangles (pyramids). One dot has the value of 1 and one line has the value of 5. The highest value of the dot line cards is 13, with the pyramid card out ranking that. However a pyramid card can also rank low in a sequence of cards, much like an Ace can in standard playing cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sequence examples:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10 (much like Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10)&amp;#10;     5, 4, 3, 2, Pyramid (much like 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cylon cards are used as wild cards, and can be played one of two ways. The card can either be a stand in for which ever card the player wants it to be OR it can be the Cap Stone to created a Full Pyramid, which is the highest possible winning hand in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are dealt initially 5 cards in Pyramid. The cards are dealt out like in Poker, one at a time around the table, beginning with the player to the dealer's left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left bets first and places their bet into the pot. Then the dealer will ask if anyone would like new cards and how many they want. Players can discard up to 4 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the new cards are dealt, each player can either surrender (discard and sit out the hand), call (match the pot), or raise (match the pot and raise it). If a player decides to raise, every other player must match this raise in order to stay in the game or surrender.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The following is the rank of winning Pyramid hands:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Full Pyramid - Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Cylon&amp;#10;     Kobol - Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10&amp;#10;     Colony - 5 cards in sequence AND of the same color&amp;#10;     Quorum - 5 cards in sequence of any color&amp;#10;     Quad - 4 cards of the same rank, one of each color&amp;#10;     Triad - 3 of a kind&amp;#10;     Duo - a pair&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If more than one player has matching hand types, then the hand that has the highest card wins out. For example two players have a Quorum. One player has 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and the other player has 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. The second player, the one with the 8, beats the hand of the first player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Much like Poker, Pyramid is a game of bets and bluffs. The goal is to win the most money in the end. Use your wits and your best Pyramid face to win all the Cubits!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
