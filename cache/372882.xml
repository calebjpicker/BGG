						               													<description>So it begins&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;hellip;the annual Guly&amp;aacute;s Festival!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everything is ready for the year&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious event to be successful. Big cauldron. Quality ingredients. Awesome vibe. What could be missing? You probably got it by now... Yes, You! The famous Guly&amp;aacute;s Masters. As soon as it turned out that you&amp;rsquo;ll be cooking the main course, many Gourmets and Locals flocked around the fire to see what you are up to. Their expectations are high and very much different. You will really have to get it together to impress these guys! And you will have to pay attention whether it is a critical kitty or a seasoned chef you want to blow away. Well, what are you waiting for? Start cooking like the Eskimo dress up! (Quick!)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Guly&amp;aacute;s is a half-cooperative game where you will need to cook a soup under changing circumstances but working together the whole time. That is until one of you thinks that it&amp;rsquo;s ready and yells &amp;lsquo;Guly&amp;aacute;s!&amp;rsquo;. Your guly&amp;aacute;s is considered successful when its value reaches 13 points. During the course of the game, you will have to cook more than one guly&amp;aacute;s. You will get a different amount of victory points for every meal you cook, depending on whether the soup was successfully made, or which Gourmets were impressed. The ultimate winner will be the person who is the best at navigating between the sneaky Locals, the other chefs and the whims of the Gourmets. And most importantly whoever reaches 7 victory points first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played through several rounds, the players cooking a separate guly&amp;aacute;s in each one of them. The players take actions in clockwise order and can decide between three actions: put an Ingredient in the cauldron, distract a Local or stir the soup. Each player has one Ingredient card in their hands, the active player draws another card - unless they stir the soup - and pick one of the two to take an action. The cards you use always go face down on the game board. Each Ingredient has a separate value so you cannot possibly know the exact value of the guly&amp;aacute;s, plus the Locals can steal ingredients from the cauldron if you don't distract them. So take extra care before yelling 'Guly&amp;aacute;s!'. If you were brave enough and yelled 'Guly&amp;aacute;s!' you will have to check the point value of the soup. If you were right and the cauldron does have 13 points worth of Ingredients in it, you get 2 Victory Points. If you were wrong, all the other players get 1 Victory Point. The players have the option to get additional Victory Points by guessing the Gourmet conditions right. After yelling 'Guly&amp;aacute;s!' but before calculating the value of the soup, the players have to guess if any (or both) of the Gourmet conditions are met. If you guessed right, you get an additional Victory Point for each Gourmet. Good luck chefs!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
