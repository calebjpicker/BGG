						               													<description>BLASTBOTS is a competitive race-against-the-clock game with a focus on resource management and strategic card play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Story So Far: CHAOS ON KHAOS-5!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For the last 5,000 years, the BLASTBOTS have been locked in an endless battle royale for control over their planet, KHAOS-5! You are the robochief of one of the tribes, and you just detected a gigantic meteor hurtling towards your home. You have two objectives &amp;mdash; and only ten turns to accomplish them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal #1: Evacuate as many of your passenger rockets as robot-ily possible before the meteor impacts KHAOS-5!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal #2: Sabotage other BLASTBOTS&amp;rsquo; escape efforts by bringing their rockets down!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Resource Management&amp;#10;It&amp;rsquo;s all about strategy. And resources. And management. And resource management. Deploy resource tokens to operate different sections of KHAOS-5&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing infrastructure. Each section of the board represents different card draws, and you can reallocate your tokens at an opportune moment to surprise your opponents and disrupt their strategies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Card-driven&amp;#10;There are rocket, battle, and discovery cards, and players can draw from the three different decks based on their resource token placement on the resource grid. &amp;#10;     &amp;#10;The types of cards:&amp;#10;Rocket cards super-charge your escape efforts, letting your rockets escape the doomed planet into the safety of space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battle cards offer different ways to sabotage other robotribes&amp;rsquo; escape efforts every step of the way. From destroying rockets in an opponent&amp;rsquo;s factory, launchpad, or even in the atmosphere, your battle cards can inflict the worst kind of damage. . .MAJOR damage. &amp;#10;Discovery cards modify rocket and battle cards present rare opportunities to gain an upper hand in this chaotic struggle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Remember: You&amp;rsquo;re racing time; and time is pretty quick.&amp;#10;Meteors slow no robot. You start the game with ten turns to evacuate your BLASTBOTS and sabotage your enemies. When the first player&amp;rsquo;s meteor totem crosses the threshold to IMPACT, the game ends. Big boom &amp;mdash; and maybe doom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
