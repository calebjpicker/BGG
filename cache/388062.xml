						               													<description>Revolutions and appreciation for traditions, fight for freedom, for rights and the pursuit of truth: Tert&amp;uacute;lia is a game where you will gather and get to know great thinkers, their ideas, and the events that changed humanity!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So get your cards ready, because here's another opportunity to gather friends, impress your family, liven up the classroom, and even impress on a date!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Communists, liberals, conservatives, feminists, illuminists, and Greeks: these are the schools that compete for precious points to win the game. With these thinkers in hand, you can devise strategies to publish books and stage long-awaited historical events.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But beware: the competition is unpredictable and your opponents will want to put obstacles in your way to try to score points before you. Card negotiations and alliances can disrupt whoever is in the lead...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
