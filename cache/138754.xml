						               													<description>Mages in the Marketplace is a highly interactive deck-building game where each player takes on the role of one of four mages. Each mage may also select one of four familiars, minor elementals that grow in power as they are fed magic. These mages are vying to become the richest and most famous, each for their own individual reasons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The twist: Players take their turns simultaneously, and when it is time to decide which card they would like to purchase from the center, all mages hide their selection, revealing them together. Any player who is alone purchases their card without worry, but any time multiple players wish to purchase the same card, a duel takes place between their familiars. The crowd cheers for the winner, who then purchases that card, whereas the losing familiar becomes hurt and its master must find a new card to purchase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The mages include:&amp;#10;The Magician: a master of showmanship. He uses impressive magic to generate extra Fame.&amp;#10;The Seer: a mage with the ability to see into the future. She can influence what order she draws her spells in.&amp;#10;The Sorcerer: a chaotic mage with little control, and less desire for it. His unpredictable nature makes him difficult to defeat in battle.&amp;#10;The Wizard: an old academic with a deep understanding of magic itself. His mana generation is second to none.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The familiars come in four basic flavours, Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, and as one feeds their Elemental they may blend them together into more complicated beasts - by combining Fire and Water, for example, one may create a Steam Elemental. All combinations are represented, including the all-powerful Omni Elemental!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: &amp;quot;Mages in the Marketplace&amp;quot; is a working title.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
