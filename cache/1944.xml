						               													<description>An unusual trick-taking, point-based bluffing card game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal&amp;#10;Getting as many points as possible by collecting egg cards and avoiding cards with fried eggs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play&amp;#10;The 12 egg cards are put into a stack.&amp;#10;The other cards (in four colours, each with values 1-24) are shuffled if the game is played with 8 players. If there are fewer players, specific cards are removed. Each player is dealt 12 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The start player calls a colour. Each player puts a  card in front of him/herself, face down. If you have a card of the called colour, you have to put down a card of that colour. If not, you can choose any of your cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all players have put down a card, each player decides if he/she wants to reveal his/her card, starting with the start player. You can only reveal your card if it is of the colour that was called. But if you have played a card in the called colour, you can choose to pretend you didn't and thus don't reveal your card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If nobody reveals a card, the caller stays in control. If any cards have been revealed, the player with the highest card takes over control.&amp;#10;The player in control can choose between&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     continuing&amp;#10;     ending the round&amp;#10;     doubting a player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the player in control continues, the same colour stays active and all players put a second card on top of the previous.&amp;#10;If the player in control ends the round, the biggest liar is determined: the unrevealed cards are revealed and the player who played the highest card in the called colour gets an egg card. Then all played cards are put into a stack next to the player.&amp;#10;If the player in control doubts a player, that player has to reveal his/her played card. If it is of the called colour, the doubted player must take all the played cards. If the player in control incorrectly doubts a player (i.e. they played a card in a different colour), the doubter must take all the played cards. Some cards have fried eggs printed on them, which count as negative points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when the last card has been played.&amp;#10;Each egg card is worth 3 points, each fried egg on one of the cards a player has received counts as -1. After five games, all points are added up and the player with the most points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
