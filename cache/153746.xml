						               													<description>Machinas: Death Races in the Wasteland is a post apocalypse racing game that  features a unique set of mechanics where the players are involved at all times. Unlike other race games where players can drift far to the rear and out of the action, Machinas uses a &amp;quot;pack&amp;quot; mechanic where players are always in the action. Instead of tracking your position on the track we track your position in the &amp;quot;pack&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Machinas is our first card driven game that can be played by itself or added to any existing miniatures or RPG. Machinas is a stand alone game that can be used with any Post Apocalyptic rules, such as our own After the Horsemen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All you need to play Machinas comes in one deck of cards and the rules. No track is needed and all you need to know to play the game is on the cards! You will have to provide a couple of everyday six-sided dice, but that's it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players customize their drivers and cars then race around the track. If you want you can race along highways and roadways in your favorite post apocalyptic setting, it's up to you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each driver has three Attributes - Savvy, Tech, and Speed and there's a wide variety of ways to customize your car. When the race starts each player keeps his cards out of sight until needed. Once played the cards are laid out for all to see. This keeps the customization of your car a secret until it is revealed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But customizing your car and driver is just the beginning.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the race you have to plan your strategy and tactics. When do you sit back and when do you make your move? Do you try and shoot up your opponents or make dramatic two car passes? Machinas is much more than rolling dice and the drivers with the the right strategy and good tactics will win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Machinas is a perfect one-off pickup game, easy to learn and fun to play. For the serious gamers you can choose to play the Campaign Game where your cars and drivers get better as you gain experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
