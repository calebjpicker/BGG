						               													<description>Assemble a vintage map puzzle and print and solve mysteries hidden within the map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game uses the 1939 World Wonders map produced by Ernest Dudley Chase. It is a highly detailed pictorial representation of known historical and geographical facts at the time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players cooperate to first assemble the puzzle into a map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then print individual quests that can only be solved by examining the map. A quest is solved by decoding a mysterious sentence with hidden words.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each quest consists of a series of questions. Players examine the map to locate each answer and write the answer into the empty boxes on the printed page. At least one letter of the answer is highlighted and that letter relates to one of the mystery words.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all words have been found, their letters are collected and unscrambled. Once the words are ordered correctly, the mystery sentence is decoded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An example of a mystery sentence to decode:&amp;#10;Columbus hid the obelisk in Montevideo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players may work together or solve their own mysteries.&amp;#10;Unlimited random mysteries can be generate forever.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This puzzle is part of the Pluzzables series of puzzles that each turn into board games. In this case, Puzzler's Quest is also a print and play game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
