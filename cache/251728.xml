						               													<description>Dragon Stories is a story telling euro style game that utilizes modified worker placement and area control set in the fantasy world of the Arcturian nations.  The mighty Dragon Weyr has withdrawn their protection from the peoples of the land due to corruption and mistrust between the various races.  The leaders of the nations no longer believe that an outside threat exists which could harm their realm and have begun to manipulate the dragons into attacking their new found local enemies.  The Dragon Weyr viewed these actions as a violation of the ancient code set forth at the beginning of time and have thusly withdrawn their support from the land.  However, not all people are corrupt in the land.  The sacred religious council set up by Arcturias himself still holds hope that the hearts of the corrupted can be turned virtuous again in time.  The council has therefore laid the burden of traveling throughout the land to sway the ancient protectors, upon you.  If you accomplish the task of reinstating the ancient code, the evil that lurks in the shadows will be too weak to overthrow the local kingdoms.  &amp;#10;In Dragon Stories, 1-6 players will manage stats on their individual player boards similar to an engine building game.  The stats on the board also act as currency in the game.  Stat labels are ranged / melee weapons, defensive armor, magical talents and various skills depending on the player board making Dragon Stories uniquely asymmetrical.  Players will interact with the game itself through stories written on cards.  Tough decisions will have to be made to convince the ancient dragons to help protect the realm.  Players will manipulate a modified worker placement system.  Player board stats will have the ability to be improved and players will have to defend the land from invading forces and possibly other players.  Ultimately though, if players do not figure out how to work together, the impending evil will take over the land.  Additionally, the invading evil is also seeking to persuade the dragons to destroy the people of the land.  Enemy forces will accomplish this through a game driven worker placement mechanic which ultimately ends up limiting players worker placement choices as the game progresses.  The only way to stop the enemy is through area control and persuading the dragons to honor the old code.  &amp;#10;Dragon Stories also features different ways to play to suit differing play styles.  Players can play full coop mode which is an all win or all lose style game.  Players can also choose to either play semi cooperatively or strictly competitively.  In the end, you will tell your own Dragon Stories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
