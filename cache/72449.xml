						               													<description>[This game was created for the Sneaky SciFi Game Design Contest http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/55802/sneaky-sci-fi-game-design-contest-geeklist-entri please give it a visit and try out the other great games that were created for the occasion.]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Listen well and attend, for this is the way it was. They were here when our mighty forces came, this planet that was ours by right. They fought us till they were no more, ground to dust by our stark fists of destiny. We remember though, we remember them by playing this simple game. We remember how cheaply they sold their last moments, how easily they were led to the slaughter with mere promises. We remember the last of them, the very last, for that was our promise....that the last sneak standing would find a place in our history. So now remember...&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Battle Of The Stark Fist on July 5th  was brutal, short and final. What remained of Humanity was marched off to a barren expanse of wreckage known as Camp Apocalypse.  As the leader of one of the last remaining factions your goal is to keep your people alive as long as you can how ever you can in hope that something or someone might come along to save you from total destruction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your first job is to secure your followers a place to survive. With limited space you plot and plan with the other faction leaders to carve out your new home.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your next job is to survive each day. The one certainty is that  when the sun sets another part of Camp Apocalypse will be destroyed by the malevolent Stark Fist. In the morning will need to bargain with what resources you have, including the lives your your followers, to find out what part of the Camp is going to be destroyed. The afternoon is spent moving your followers around the Camp to avoid the coming nights destruction, hopefully with the knowledge of  where the destruction is going to happen. After the bombs fall you will need to spend the evening hours caring for those who survived. If you can not supply them with food and shelter they will perish in the harsh night.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each day goes as the one before and and your goal becomes ever more important...to have your faction be the last of Humanity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Flow&amp;#10;-Setup Up Phase- Camp Apocalypse&amp;#10;-Main Phase - It Was The Best Of Times It Was The Last Of Times&amp;#10;--- 1.
