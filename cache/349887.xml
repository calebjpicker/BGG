						               													<description>Birdy can be played in two very different ways. Whether it involves matching colours and collecting birds or putting down bird cards on ones that have already been set out &amp;ndash; both game variants promise loads of fun and develop children&amp;rsquo;s matching abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 1: Feeding the birds &amp;#10; At the moment the birds can&amp;rsquo;t find anything to eat around them and need help from humans. Attract the  birds with food so that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to go hungry. The 25 bird cards are shuffled and then spread out on  the table face down. Three arbitrary cards are left face up so they are visible to all players, and the dice are &amp;#10;placed nearby.&amp;#10; The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. He then chooses one of the 3 face-up cards and tries to attract the selected bird by rolling the matching colours. The player has a total of 3 attempts, and can set aside any matching dice with each attempt &amp;ndash; and continue to roll the dice/die the remaining times. The picture of a birdhouse functions as a joker and can stand for any colour. The X on the die is a &amp;bdquo;Lame Duck&amp;ldquo;, and can&amp;rsquo;t be placed anywhere. If the player manages to cover all colours after rolling the dice (a maximum of) three times, he can keep the card &amp;ndash; otherwise, he has to put the card back. It is then the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn. If the previous player was able to collect a bird, then a new card is turned face up, so that there are 3 cards face up again. The object of the game is to attract 3 of the same kind of bird.&amp;#10;The game ends when one player has attracted 3 of the same birds. That player wins the round. If none of the players succeeds, the one who has collected the most birds wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 2: Bird dominoes&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you link all of the birds onto the long chain of birds? Try to be the first player to attach all of your birds to the long row of birds. The 25 bird cards are shuffled thoroughly and spread out face down on the table &amp;ndash; one card in the middle is turned face up, and one die is placed nearby. Then each player is given 4 bird cards to start with.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. The first player to roll a birdhouse starts. He rolls with one die, and there are the following possibilities:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Rolls a colour: The colour that is rolled matches a &amp;ldquo;free colour point&amp;rdquo; on the card in the middle and one of the bird cards that the active player has shows the same colour &amp;ndash; very good, the bird  card can be placed&amp;#10;     Rolls a colour: The colour that is rolled is not a &amp;ldquo;free colour point&amp;rdquo; or the active player doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a bird card that shows the colour &amp;ndash; too bad, it&amp;rsquo;s the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn&amp;#10;     Rolls a &amp;ldquo;Lame Duck&amp;rdquo;: The active player draws a &amp;ldquo;penalty card&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;     Rolls a joker: The active player can place an arbitrary card on a free and matching colour point&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who is first to place all of his bird cards wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
