						               													<description>Recreate all the action of the ballpark with this tabletop baseball game that will have you getting base hits and scoring runs just by rolling the dice! With each combination of rolled dice representing a play, grab your teammates and see whose team can rack up the most runs and which team will strike out. It's just the thing to add a fun new twist to America's favorite pastime!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is a stylized baseball diamond, with a dry-erase scoreboard at centerfield, twelve metal pegs in two different colors, with holes for the pegs at each base location on the diamond. The pegs fit into two &amp;quot;dugouts&amp;quot; of six holes each on opposite sides of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After determining team names and which team is home and visitor, the players write the team names on the scoreboard with the provided marker. The visitor player places one of their pegs at home plate as the batter, and roles the two dice once. The result is compared to the chart on the playing board, and the runner is either out, or scores a single, double, triple, or home run. If the runner is out, that peg is placed on the lowest numbered open &amp;quot;OUTS&amp;quot; hole on the scoreboard. If the runner advances, the peg is placed in the hole at the proper base location. If a run is scored, the number on the scoreboard is adjusted with the marker and that peg is returned to the dugout.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play proceeds until the visitor player has three outs, then the home player repeats the process for the bottom half of the inning. The two players may play a full nine innings, or some agreed-upon shorter game. The game can be played by two players or teams.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
