						               													<description>An extra card to add to Impression.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Essen promo card is visibly placed on the table at the start of the game with the I side up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players may use the card actions on their turn. When the order cards from age I run out on the table, the card is flipped to the II-IV side for the rest of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Card actions:&amp;#10;The player taking a turn may choose to keep all tradesmen on the board in the same location, and instead of moving them, lie one of them down and perform the promo card action instead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I side&amp;#10;The player taking a turn lays down one of their tradesmen and takes 2 different resources from the supply. This is their action for the turn, after this, the next player takes a turn. The other non-active players can now choose to pay 1 mark to the active player and take 2 identical resources from the supply. The non-active players may only do this once each, and they pay the mark from their own supply. If they don't have money, they cannot make use of this action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;II-IV side&amp;#10;The player taking a turn lays down one of their tradesmen and chooses one of the following 3 options:&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Perform a free production. They don&amp;rsquo;t spend capacity or resources for this. One of the order tiles moves one slot to the right, if it can move. If the order is now completed, the player receives the points as a reward, if it contained a signboard, the benefits may now be gained. If the player had the correct factories on the technology board, they may also gain their benefits.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Make a free movement step on the map, or move to the front on the order track. If the map move is chosen, the move is free, and if he should arrive in a city with this step, one city marker is placed there, and may also gain the city disc, should it be available. No factory may be built and no trade action can be done. If the order track is chosen, and if another player is further ahead, this player can be overtaken, irrespective of what space they are on.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Carry out a typesetting action. They may take a lead letter from next to their board and move it to their composing stick board. If the letters match, the bonus is gained as usual, the contract slot can be unlocked, if the formation is right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
