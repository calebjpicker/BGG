						               													<description>This is a unique game which mixes elements of Connect Four and Twister.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is a unit that holds 21 tiles (3 rows of 7), but only the centre 9 tiles are visible to the players. New tiles can be added to the game board on either end, and into any of the rows. Each time a new tile is added to the game board a tile is ejected from the other end of the same row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The tiles display either a body part (nose, forehead, ear, shoulder, elbow, belly button, back, knee or foot) or &amp;quot;Bent Out of Shape.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a player's turn (or the team's turn if playing in teams), the player rolls the die and takes the corresponding number of tiles from the facedown pile next to the board. The player then inserts the tiles into the game board, from either side and into any row. After they have inserted the new tile, the display of the 9 tiles at the centre of the board will have changed. The player will then attempt to score the body part that is displayed in the very centre of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To score the body part in the centre of the board, the other player(s) will announced the eight body parts surrounding the centre square, two at a time, starting from any corner and moving clockwise around the square of eight body parts. As the other player(s) announces the body parts, the playing player/team must connect the two body parts together by connecting the parts on each other's body or by using their hands. While holding this position, the next two body parts are announced and must be added to the current pose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the team is successful at connecting all the body parts at once, they score the body part in the centre square. If the team is unsuccessful at connecting together all of the body parts, or fails to hold the pose throughout the turn, they score nothing. Players/teams are given two chances to complete the pose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If any of the 9 tiles displayed in the game board displays &amp;quot;Bent out of Shape&amp;quot; instead of a body part, then one member of the team must try to link all of the body parts by himself/herself. Because this task is more difficult, if they succeed they can score any body they wish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first team to score all nine different body parts wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
