						               													<description>Players must complete five missions successfully or succumb to the mole.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set Up: Remove all 10's and jokers from the deck and make an identity deck out of the following cards: &amp;#10;Players 2: 10, 10, Joker&amp;#10;Players 3 or 4: 10, 10, 10, Joker&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle the cards and hand one out to each player, removing the other cards entirely from the game. The player with the Joker is the turncoat. Give five cards to each player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE MlSSlON: The game is played over a series of missions. On a player's turn they look at the top two cards of the deck and select one to determine the mission, placing the other card face-down in the discard pile. lf a player draws a picture card (known as a spy) it is immediately discarded and a new card is drawn. Then, each player takes a card and places it face down next to the mission. When all cards have been placed, add one face-down from the deck, shuffle the cards, and reveal them. Cards matching the suit of the mission add to the team's total; other cards subtract from it. The total must be equal or higher than the value on the mission card to succeed. If any spies were placed, the mission fails.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ACCUSING: At any stage a player can accuse another of being a turncoat. If they are right, the team wins. If not, the turncoat wins. If there was no turncoat, everybody loses. Otherwise, the game is won by the team if they succeed five missions, and won by the turncoat if the team loses five missions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the designer: &amp;quot;Werewolf (or as it is sometimes called, &amp;quot;Mafia&amp;quot;) was always a fantastic game for me, and one I played a lot in my early university years. It is a game of two teams, but of unknown identities. It is an interesting mix of old and new design concepts; the heated discussion and bluffing generated by Werewolf is very modem; whereas the player elimination and sitting around is becoming ever more rare with each new design. One immensely popular (but lengthy) board game involving traitors is Battlestar Galactica, by Corey Konieczka. It sets players on a spaceship, trying to collectively ward off dangers, which would be easier, were it not for the traitor in the midst. I have extracted the game's clever system of sabotage-by-card, and came up with Turncoat.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
