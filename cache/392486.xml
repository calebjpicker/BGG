						               													<description>Dead Grandma is a competitive game of inheritance, full of ruthless rivalries, and strategic sibling shenanigans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will compete for their Grandma's possessions. The first player to win three possessions of one color or three possessions of different colors wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, a possession card is revealed and players will play a number card to bid on that possession. After the initial bid, players can play action cards to help themselves get a higher score or sabotage other players. The round continues until all players have passed. After each player has passed, whoever has the highest score wins the possession card and places it in front of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues until one player has a winning set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
