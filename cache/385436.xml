						               													<description>Step into the role of a space orchestra manager with Philharmonix, the worker placement game that combines music and sci-fi in an out-of-this-world experience!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Send your orchestra on missions to perform on different planets, strategically acquire new talented musicians, and train them to reach their full potential. Please the patrons that sponsor these concerts with your performances, and watch out for unexpected challenges along the way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Philharmonix, you play as a space orchestra manager, trying to become the most prestigious orchestra in the Malaya sector.&amp;#10;Each turn, you will select one of the 6 major actions or the basic move action. The basic action is to move across the Malayan planets or to gain money. The major actions include: recruiting musicians, training musicians &amp;amp; conductors, creating symphonies, performing Symphonies, gaining patrons, and expanding your knowledge and experience. During your turn, you can also perform free actions to manipulate your gameplay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each action consumes action points which would be randomized every round and could consume more action points if the action is&amp;#10;occupied. Thus, players need to be efficient in selecting their actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can gain Prestige in many ways, but mainly from performing Symphonies and recording &amp;ldquo;Records&amp;rdquo; (objectives). Other&amp;#10;methods of gaining Prestige are region majority, collecting musicians, and claiming patrons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after five rounds and the player with the most Prestige is the winner of the game and is proclaimed the best space orchestra manager!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
