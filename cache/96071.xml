						               													<description>Throughout the galaxy, mankind drifts alone, surviving within self-contained space stations known as Islands. They dedicate their lives to trying to build the most magnificent Island in order to impress the mysterious and alluring &amp;lsquo;Angels&amp;rsquo; who are believed to offer eternal life, rebirth and all one could desire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Life on the islands is hard, mining asteroids for ore to refine in hot furnaces to increase the power and prestige of their Islands. The presence of weapons is known to anger the Angels, but some Islands develop them regardless, seeking to increase mining production, for defence, or for attacking their rivals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the Angels arrive, their whims are capricious. Sometimes they merely observe, sometimes they attack. Only the most magnificent Island in the eyes of the Angels will be chosen to be visited by them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;INTRODUCTION&amp;#10;A game for one to three players who must navigate through space, looking for asteroids to mine in order to obtain the ore needed to build and improve their Island. They must avoid deadly asteroid collisions and the aggression of their rivals as they await the coming of the Angels, bringing with them the promise of eternal peace and the threat of destruction. The winner has the greatest island (decided by points) at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY&amp;#10;Each player controls an 'island' a fully self-sufficent space station.  Players must move through the asteroid dense area of space on the board, destroy asteroids and then collectthe shattered remnants.  This can then be refined to create pure ore, and the different ores can be used to create different additional sections of the island, or repair damaged ones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Needless to say, eventually the islands will come into conflict with each other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game's length is determined by the appearences of the mysterious angel-ships, players do no know how long the game is going to last exactly (20-45 minutes on average) and so must judge wen to build offensive weaponry (which score negative at the end), and when to capitalise on point scoring with certain sections (such as more luxurious living quarters and armour) nearer the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The angels appear throughout the game, often dealing death and destruction to the island sections.  The final angel's appearence ends the game, points are scored, and one player wins, becoming the chosen recpient of the angel's love.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
