						               													<description>A dice battle game between fearless creatures. Use action cards to play creatures from your hand, battle with any creatures that are in play, and draw cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each creature's ability are described on the card. Roll battle dice. Collect victory tokens when you send creatures to the discard pile. The player with the most victory tokens wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn works like this: each player chooses an action card (draw cards, play cards, battle), and then actions are resolved in order (draw cards, battle, play cards).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Creatures roll the same # of dice as their strength ratings in the upper right, though the number of battle dice that are rolled may be modified by creature descriptions (both attacker and defender) or by other creature cards with the ability to interrupt a battle. Resolve the battle, and then collect victory tokens (if earned).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A battle works like this: a melee battle happens simultaneously, which means creatures on both sides get to roll before any damage is applied. Because damage is applied at the same time, both sides may win or lose a battle. Some creatures can ranged battle, which means they get to roll, but their opponent does not. Some creatures have first-strike ability, which means they get to apply battle damage before the defender rolls back.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All creatures have unique descriptions and capabilities. Lots of creatures have the ability to band together (as herds, swarms, pods, flocks, etc.) and when they are banded together they battle as a group. Damage to creatures that band together is still determined by a creature's individual strength. It is possible possible for a large group of creatures to cause a lot of damage, but also to take a lot of damage that is applied to more than one creature in the group.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some cards (in expansion packs) represent places. The creatures in these places battle just like the named creature cards with the card strength representing both the creature's strength and the places strength. (Yes, you can also battle places!). Some places cards can generate groups of creatures, as described by the card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Use the included white tokens to track victory points. Use the included colored tokens to track individual creature status, such as the number of creatures on a places card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fearless Creatures is supposed to be a lightweight, fun (yet kinda silly) battle game between creatures that might not always get a chance to battle in real life. It's also meant to be educational, as in &amp;quot;What is this creature?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Where is this place?&amp;quot; and then you can learn more about them. The game is best played in small groups of 2-4 people, ideally a family setting that spans generations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No creatures were harmed while creating this game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fearless Creatures is a print-on-demand card game.
