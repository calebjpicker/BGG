						               													<description>All is not well in the quiet village of Shadowsfall. People are disappearing and there are reports of strange happenings. With fear and suspicion a rife, the villagers have called for the Witch Hunter. Meanwhile, there is turmoil among the Council of Witches. The High Witch is dead and the witches are fighting among themselves for the right to succeed her. But only the most powerful witch can ascend to such a high status.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you gather a coven to take the title of High Witch for yourself, while evading The Witch Hunter hell-bent on burning every witch he meets? In Fate of Witches, 2-4 players compete to create the most powerful coven.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;Fate of Witches is played over several game rounds. Each round consists of three phases in which players first draw a Character Card, and then cast an effect or place a Character into their Coven. Once all players have had a turn, the Hunters in play move. The player with The Witch&amp;rsquo;s Coin then resolves an Event Card. The Player with the highest-scoring coven at the end of the game is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Player Rounds&amp;#10;A round is made of three phases: Drafting, Hunters Movement and the Event. To begin the round, the player with The Witch&amp;rsquo;s Coin draws 4 cards from the Village Deck and places them in 4 piles right of the Village Deck face up. These 4 cards are referred to as the Village Square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Drafting Phase&amp;#10;The player with the Witch&amp;rsquo;s Coin goes first. Players take turns in a clockwise order until all players have had a turn. On your turn, draw into your hand one card from either the Village Deck or the Village Square. Any player can then choose to immediately play a card from their hand: they can either add a Character Card to their Coven (up to a maximum of 5) or cast a Character Card Effect. If an effect is played from a player&amp;rsquo;s hand, that card is resolved immediately.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hunter Movement Phase&amp;#10;The Witch Hunter and the Hound are in town and might be investigating your coven. If a Hunter is currently in a player&amp;rsquo;s coven they are unable to play certain effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Event Phase&amp;#10;After the Hunter Movement Phase, the Event Phase begins. The player to the left of the current Witch&amp;rsquo;s Coin holder will draw an Event Card. That player must keep the Event Card secret, only revealing it once the card has been resolved. There are two types of Event Cards: Scenario and Major Event cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Final round&amp;#10;The final round is triggered when the last Event Card is resolved and placed into the Event Discard Pile. You then play one last drafting phase. Once every player has had a turn, this signifies the end of the game. Now added up your total score and subtract any penalties, the player with the highest scoring coven is declared the winner and is crowned the new High Witch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
