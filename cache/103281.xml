						               													<description>THE WARS OF THE ROSES are ON!&amp;#10;Between 1450 and 1490 direct usurpation was the rule rather than the exception. Around a half dozen men claimed the crown of England-Henry Holland, Richard of York, Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck failed. Edward Earl of March, Richard Duke of Gloucester and Henry Tudor succeeded. Henry of Lancaster possessed it twice, while his son was dispossessed once.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is my opinion that this is one of our best campaign games. We managed to work in all kinds of period flavour while making the game easy and playable, in a system that brings a historical result. The decisions are agonizing, but play moves very quickly, and with most scenarios only a few turns long, you could easily get two into one game night!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most scenarios begin with few troops in play- a faction must use their nobles in the ancestral lands to gather Well-Wishers, Retainers and Array troops and lead them into battle. Spend too much time recruiting and you'll find your side already beaten leaving you nothing for it but to abandon your troops and flight to the Continent! You have to act quickly and often risk the game on one move that will make or break your claimant's chance at the throne...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Above Description from game's web site&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played after choosing a scenario depicting one campaign during the wars. Typical victory conditions include clearing a geographic area or capturing/killing specified enemy personalities. To that end players maneuver their nobles on an area map of England seeking to raise troops and then confront their opponent. A robust battle system is included, but battles may also be played out using the related &amp;quot;A Coat of Steel&amp;quot; miniatures rules if the players prefer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
