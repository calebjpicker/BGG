						               													<description>Dribble, Shoot, Roll! is a 2-player basketball card game in which players take on the role of a Head Coach, draft a team, and roll dice to score points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players begin the game by having a Draft. During the Draft, players will take turns drawing and drafting basketball players to form their basketball team. Each basketball player has a skill level (1-6) for each of the shot attempt skills. The higher the skill number, the higher the chance of that player scoring on their shot attempt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once their teams are established, players will begin play. Players will shuffle their player decks and draw the top 5 basketball player cards to form their lineup. They then will choose one player from their lineup to put into the scoring position.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next, one player will reveal the Shot Attempt Card and reveal what shot the players will attempt. Both players will roll their basketball die and compare the number rolled with their basketball player's skill number of the shot that is being attempted. If the player's skill number is equal to or exceeds the number the player rolled on his/her die, then the scoring attempt is successful. The player gains the number of points the shot attempt awards (1,2, or 3 points). Players then move their scoring marker on their player scoreboard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will repeat this process until the Shot Attempt Deck is depleted. This completes a quarter. The game consists of 4 quarters. After all 4 quarters, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
