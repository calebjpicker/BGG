						               													<description>&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;        To do: This game description is English-translated-to-German-with-Systrans, and needs to be turned into real English.&amp;#10;For example, all &amp;quot;maps&amp;quot; should be &amp;quot;cards&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;|-&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game about snail running. The players lay color rows out before themselves using their snail maps. Each player tries to protect  their color rows as quickly as possible, because only those cards score when they are played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of 110 cards with different moves for snails on them. Among them are colored snails, Schnarchschnecken, snails cards and turbo-snails. To begin play, all cards are mixed and each player is dealt 5 cards for their hand. In addition 3 sets of snail cards are laid out in the center of the table. (thus again in each case 5 pieces) are laid out. These form the exchange supply.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player puts the fifth snail into a color row, this row is protected. Those cards are put aside and are counted as one point per card. Added to his own snail cards,  the player receives a card with  same color numbers as the other players. There is also a wild card color which can be added. That card is is collected by all, is thus particularly lucrative but in  addition it is risky to try and collect  . By means of this pfiffigen mechanism the author achieves a high interaction between the players. These are practically always into the play merged.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The special snail maps bring an additional attraction into the play. With the Schnarchschnecke a  player is forced to an obligation break by a round. With a turbo-snail   can   lock even if  5 cards do not  lie in the row. And finally the card snails: These serve to allow a player to exchange a card from his hand with one the center of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Goldsieber &amp;#195;&amp;#160; la Carte line of games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
