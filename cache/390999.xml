						               													<description>As the dust settles on planet Eiras, the survivors of Blaine's team return to a meeting with Blaine aboard his starship, 'Dictator'. In their possession is something of exceptional value, an item sure to fetch a great price from some of the most wealthy and powerful beings in the galaxy. However, the Council of Seven are not the only beings with an interest in what was taken from Eiras.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Emerging from mist-shrouded worlds on the edge of corporate space, &amp;lsquo;The Nameless&amp;rsquo; are shuffling, rolling, and oozing forth. From tentacled swarms of octopedal minions to titanic &amp;lsquo;ogres&amp;rsquo; with thick, crab-like shells and man-crushing claws, there is no end to the horrors of the Nameless horde.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Terrible events in their own planetary system and the very real possibility of mass extinction have led some Nameless factions to resort to extreme measures in order to survive. Seemingly random incursions into GCPS space and attacks on its facilities are all designed to find a means of salvation for their race.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, following a mysterious tip off that revealed the location of Blaine and his prized cargo from Eiras, a strike team of tentacled creatures attacks Blaine&amp;rsquo;s hideout, forcing Blaine himself to fight for his life. Faced with the ruthless onslaught of the frenzied Nameless, can Blaine and his mercenary crew survive their toughest challenge yet?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
