						               													<description>Story&amp;#10;In a realm plagued by chaos and uncertainty, legends spoke of a powerful elixir called Amrita. This mystical potion could restore balance and grant eternal life. Kings from different realms, driven by their desire for immortality, started a war within their kingdoms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battles raged fiercely as alliances were formed and shattered. Betrayals became common, and dark magic tainted the battlefield. The kings and their loyal followers faced treacherous foes, each striving to possess Amrita for their selfish ambitions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this grand war of strategy and wit, players take on the roles of mighty leaders. They command their armies like weapons, seeking domination over their rivals. Maneuvering through perilous terrains, managing resources, and issuing commands to their troops, they must make critical decisions that can tip the balance of power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Who will emerge victorious and claim the coveted elixir of Amrita? Only the strongest, most cunning, and worthy shall prevail. Are you prepared to seize your destiny and attain immortality?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Number of Players: 2-6&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Objective:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of am&amp;#225;&amp;#185;&amp;#155;taka is to have the strongest army and become the Godfather of the Underworld by winning armies and Army from other players through elimination. The game uses a deck of 54 cards and 60 Army tokens, also 60 Army tokens (or similar tokens).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;54 Attack Cards&amp;#10;60 Army Tokens (Each player 10 )&amp;#10;6 Magic Tokens(Each player 1 )&amp;#10;54 Resource tokens (Each player 9)&amp;#10;30 Health tokens (Each player 5)&amp;#10;1 Game board&amp;#10;6 Character meeples &amp;#10;5 Special abilities&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Setup:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle the deck of cards. Give each player a specific number of cards based on the number of players:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For 2 players: Deal 8 cards to each player.&amp;#10;For 3 players: Deal 6 cards to each player.&amp;#10;For 4 or more players: Deal 4 cards to each player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Put the remaining cards facedown in the middle of the table to create the Draw Pile. Each player starts with a hand of cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, players use cards from their hand to attack their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Resource Allocation:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player gets 10 Army tokens, 9 Ability tokens, 5 Power tokens, and 1 Magic Spell tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, the youngest player begins with attack cards to start attacking. To attack, a player needs attack cards and at least one army token. They can also decide to include more army tokens, resource tokens, and health tokens in their moves. However, there is a maximum limit of 2 for each kind of token.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of a player's turn, they choose a card from their hand and place it in front of one of their opponents. The opponent does the same thing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Afterward, the attacking player selects another player to attack by picking one of their cards. Both players must add tokens representing Army value, resources, and health to carry out the attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards tell us how valuable the tokens are. In a battle, the tokens with higher values win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Let's say Player A wants to attack Player B. Player A has tokens that are worth 1 Resource, 4 Army, and 2 health, which adds up to a total value of 7. Player A will choose their plan based on this. Player B needs to have tokens that add up to a higher value if they want to beat Player A in the battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When someone loses, they lose their health and resource tokens. These tokens can be placed anywhere on the Shadow board. Army tokens, on the other hand, are always placed in the center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When someone wins, they also lose their health and resource tokens and put them on the Shadow board. However, the winner is not required to put Army tokens in the center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When someone loses many soldiers or faces a challenging situation where powerful cards attack, they can use magic tokens to defend themselves. Magic tokens need to be placed in a specific area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When it's a player's turn, they can only put one token in one place. They can't put more than one token in the same spot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Get Tokens:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can retrieve their tokens from the Shadow Leader's board by playing cards with a specific attack value. When a player lands on a particular spot during their turn, they have the option to collect all the tokens available from the next spot on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here's the rewritten passage using simpler language:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For instance, when a player reaches the 5th spot, they receive tokens from the 6th spot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To achieve this, players should follow these steps:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions for Winning Players:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First Action - Move your character according to the number on your player card.&amp;#10;Second Action - Collect tokens from the Shadow leaderboard.&amp;#10;Third Action - Extra step: If someone wins a battle round, they can take a special action on their turn. This action lets them move special Ability tokens to another spot on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions of the Player Who Is Losing:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First Action - Move your character according to the number on your player card.&amp;#10;Second Action - Collect tokens from the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Get Army Tokens:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player reaches a specific location on the game board during their turn and has the chance to collect their Magic Spell tokens, they also retrieve one of their Army tokens from the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player finishes their turn, they need to take a new card from the Draw Pile. The game keeps going in a clockwise direction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game goes on until there is only one player left with Army tokens. That player becomes the immortal of the world and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
