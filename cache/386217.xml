						               													<description>Shepherds of the Fall is a competitive card, dice and domino game focused on collectively responding to the ecological collapse brought on by climate disruption. In this game, you are scientists and researchers exploring a map of cards representing four different ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest, each of which is facing the distinct and violent effects of extreme climatic changes. Your team of meeples spends time discovering the land, finding threatened dice species on the verge of collapse. Using dominoes to determine your actions and movement, you gather these species up and deliver them to field hospitals or back to pristine ecosystems where they can heal on their own and support the biodiversity of nearby ecosystems. The winner of the game is the team with the highest reputation points for healing and reestablishing these species on the map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, you have the opportunity to train your advanced workers, research to gain new special skills, exchange species in certain locations or with opponents, receive much needed supplies and transport from helicopter visits and, most important, bring the species you collect to the rehabilitation and restoration locations to ensure their very survival.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
