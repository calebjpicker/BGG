						               													<description>Hero Mail is a cooperative or solo playable push your luck and resource management game in which you play local superheroes who must protect their city from a villain with sinister plans. The whole game fits on a postcard and there are different postcards for different cities with unique mechanics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game runs in 2 phases. In the first phase the heroes try to stop the villain's plans before he becomes too strong. The villain first collects threat markers based on the behaviour of the heroes in the last round and the current scenario. These are distributed to the different plans. Then the Heroes can recharge and use their abilities by forming 2 pairs from 4 dice rolled and taking an action marker with the corresponding number. If the number is no longer available, it cannot be taken. And if no available or already taken number is rolled and the dice cannot be manipulated with the hero's abilities, the hero loses all markers collected in this round. Heroes can decide to end their turn at any time, in which case they may use their markers to prevent the villain's plans, reduce damage or recharge their abilities. Once all heroes have finished their turn, the villain's unresolved plans are handled and his power increases according to the heroes' behaviour.&amp;#10;When all plans have been foiled or the villain has become too strong, it comes to the grand finale, in which the heroes must defeat the villain. The heroes must complete tasks based on the action markers they have placed during the course of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game was designed during the second corona wave and has several free to download scenarios, to bring some boardgames to everybody during the social distance time. You can also send the postcard with game to your game playing friends and Relatives. You can also support your local game store with this game, as there are several special scenario postcards, which are exclusive available in local game stores.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
