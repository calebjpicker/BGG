						               													<description>Adults always play on the blue track, children on the winding brown track. Each player receives a figure that he places on the starting position at the beginning of the game. Each player receives 3 ducats as entry fee, the remaining ducats go into the bank. The winner of a game is whoever brings home 10 ducats first.&amp;#10;The blue track (adults)&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, each player on this lane receives 6 jokers (2 of each value). The jokers are placed before rolling: they can be used when you are behind and want to move forward quickly or when you want to jump over an obstacle. The placed jokers must be given to the bank. The bank also gets 12 jokers in reserve. The bank jokers must be placed in such a way that the 4 jokers are on the bottom, then the 3 jokers and on top the 2 jokers.&amp;#10;You get a new joker as soon as you come to a crossing space (purple). You get a ducat when you reach or jump over the ducat bank.&amp;#10;If a player on the blue lane comes to an intersection with the brown lane, he receives a joker if this space is unoccupied. However, if the crossing is occupied by a player on the brown track, or if he reaches it, he must be paid a ducat as a way fee, and the player who paid must also go back 1 space.&amp;#10;If a player on the blue lane reaches another player on his lane, he receives a ducat from him. If 2 players are already sitting on a space reached by another, each player must pay 1 ducat to the newcomer.&amp;#10;Every player on the blue track can place ducats on a space. If an opponent comes onto the corresponding space, the player who placed the bet receives a ducat from his opponent. A space can only be betted on by one player at a time. You can bet if you come directly to the space of the ducat bank (if you want to bet more than one ducat, then 1 ducat must be paid to the bank as a betting fee for each additional ducat placed. ) or if you have jumped over the bank space, then however, a 1 ducat placement fee must be paid for the first ducat wagered.&amp;#10;The ducats you bet can only be brought back home if you are directly in the bank or have just jumped over it.&amp;#10;The brown train (kids)&amp;#10;Each player receives 2 ducats when he enters the space of the dukate bank. If he jumps over it, he only gets 1 ducat.&amp;#10;The player can also get ducats from the blue lane players if he comes to an intersection and meets a blue lane player there (1 ducat toll).&amp;#10;If a player on the brown lane is reached by another player on the same lane, he must pay this player 1 ducat and return to spaceno. 1.&amp;#10;If a player rolls a 6 on the brown lane, he may roll again. If he comes to a crossing space, he may roll 2 more times. If another player is reached with a number rolled, he must pay and return to space 1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
