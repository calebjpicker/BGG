						               													<description>Subbuteo Cricket continued the line of sporting dexterity games started by Subbuteo football (soccer).  The game was played on a green beige mat, similar to that use for the soccer version.  The rules mimicked those of cricket (which will doubtless make this review impenetrable to most nationalities).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The bowling side placed the small red plastic ball in the channel in the bowling piece, which was then flicked to propel the ball towards the batsman and a small plastic wicket (complete with separate plastic bails).  The batting action was achieved by spinning a handle attached to a small plastic cricket bat, aiming to hit the ball to score runs; the number of runs scored depended on the distance the ball was hit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fielding side set out its players, which were small plastic men each on a molded plastic base which included a cup-shaped depression.  If the ball was hit into one of these depressions, that was a catch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules allowed for run outs (flick the ball to hit the wickets), leg before wickets (a complex and controversial assessment of whether the ball hit the plastic batsman &amp;quot;in line&amp;quot; with the stumps) and even stumping.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game did not have the genuine skill and excitement of the soccer version, but strangely it did just about work as a contest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In line with other Subbuteo games, there was a variety of &amp;quot;extras&amp;quot; to buy, including scoreboards and boundary fences.  It was well worth saving your  pocket money in the 1970s to save for the Australian team (baggy green caps), or the West Indians (black players with maroon caps).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
