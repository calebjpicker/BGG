						               													<description>&amp;quot;Saggsen Gadan, de S&amp;auml;ggs'schen Siedler&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Saggsen Gadan, the Settlers of Sax'ny&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What do you do when 2 major German game institutions both celebrate a 10 year anniversary in the same year? You throw one heck of a party and you invite all who want to come and join in. And when they leave, you give them a thank-you present.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the 10th of September 2005, the Deutsche Spielemuseum (the German Game Museum and brainchild of Peter Lemcke) celebrated in style in its current hometown of Chemnitz, in the German state of Saxony, by attempting to break a world record in conjunction with that other birthday kid, the &amp;quot;Settlers of Catan&amp;quot;. A more than 300 meter long game table was erected, offering room for 1000 Settler players, who all could participate on one gigantic Settlers map, using 17,500 Settlers' hexagons in the process. As it happened, 816 participants sat down to invade the ribbon island and the record stood.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To mark the occasion, a commemorative Settler expansion, themed on the German state of Saxony, was issued by Kosmos, in a limited edition of 1000, one for each participant. Klaus Teuber was on hand to sign his life away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Saggsen Gadan presented two new scenarios for Settlers, both requiring game pieces from the basic set to play. Special game pieces needed for these Saxony scenarios were also included, ready to cut out. Instead of the usual variable game-set-up of the basic game, the two scenarios both use a ready-made map. There is one scenario map printed on each side of the expansion sheet, in the same vein as the game boards from boxed historical theme set expansions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Saggsen-Gadan:&amp;#10;For this game variant, players must colonize Saggsen using the usual building and resource trading mechanisms. Through progressive development, different manufacturers can be founded, whose products subsequently can be turned into victory points. But be warned: Saggsen is sliced up by many rivers, that can only be crossed at bridges. To become King of Saggsen you will have to make your influence count in the seven regions of the state. Who is the first to obtain 10 victory points?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Catan-Offensive in Chemnitz - a quick scenario for 2-3 players:&amp;#10;By utilizing the resources obtained through building and trading, players aim to populate the city of Chemnitz bit by bit. As the game progresses, players can obtain colorful postcards of historical buildings, museums and leisure facilities. These postcards can then be exchanged for victory points. Karl Marx, after whom the city was known in its East German days when it was called Karl-Marx-Stadt, now takes over the role of Joker/Robber.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expands:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    CATAN&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
