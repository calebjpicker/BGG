						               													<description>This entertaining electronic game plays dozens of songs from its computer memory and has exciting lights and sounds that tell you when you win and when you lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is to win the most money by correctly identifying the mystery tunes. Rach player starts with $5,000. Turn on the game by pressing START and a random dollar value will appear on the LED display for the mystery song chosen from computer memory. Each player deposits that amount into the JACKPOT. Players then bid the number of notes they need to name the tune until all agree that the lowest bidder may proceed. The low bidder then presses the corresponding BID-A-NOTE BUTTON for his bid. The game will play that many notes of the song and the bidder has five seconds to name that tune and press the PLAY BUTTON.(If no guess is made, the &amp;quot;YOU LOSE&amp;quot; tune plays, the player loses his money and is out of the round.) The game then plays then song from beginning to end. If the player is correct, he collects the money from the JACKPOT and a new round begins. If another player believes the guess was incorrect, he may press the CHALLENGE BUTTON during the playback of the song. The playback of the song will stop and the challenger has five seconds to guess the name of the song and press the play button. Other players may challenge the subsequent guess and so on. If the players cannot agree on the name of the song, the money remains in the JACKPOT for the next round of play. The winner is the player with the most money when the when it it is agreed to end the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes a variation called &amp;quot;Stop the Music&amp;quot; and a bonus game called &amp;quot;Follow Me&amp;quot;. A list of the pre-stored songs is included. The games also allows the input of any song into the computer memory for one round of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
