						               													<description>Published in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #23.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eastfront armored combat with minatures (TAC3- 20mm) - using paper folded cards to represent the miniatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Designer's Comments&amp;quot; from Arnold Hendricks:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tac 3/20mm isn't exactly the most detailed miniature WWll land wargame around. In fact, it is really just a direct steal from TACTICAL GAME No. 3 of the TSG. What I hope it will do is provide that real bridge between board and miniatures, to get each side of the fence partly on the other. Miniature wargamers are going to find having combat factors and a CRT a bit strange, while board wargamers are going to find all those tank models and painted figures weird too. In fact, the lack of hexagons alone is startling enough.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are neither complex nor comprehensive, if anything they were designed to be clear. This game is a 'quickie', fast to set up, almost as fast to play. For those tactical historians with the &amp;quot;what if--&amp;quot;, it is a tool for endless answers. By now you should have enough organizational information to be able to set up various German and Russian formations using platoons and companies as building blocks. Pick your terrain and objectives, and have at it. If your imagination fails you, some reading into the real campaign and some of the battles should produce enough food for thought. For the fun-minded, I personally have a set of &amp;quot;orders&amp;quot; cards each containing an order of battle and a mission for one side. I set up a Russian and German deck before each battle, and thus players remain in the dark about enemy forces and objectives&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For those who find Tac 3/20mm just a nice take-off point for 1944 vintage land miniatures, note that S&amp;amp;T does indeed have considerably more detailed and simulation-oriented rules around. I know because I have designed and tested one set myself! Naturally, all it takes is a lot of little notices from you to produce them in an upcoming issue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
