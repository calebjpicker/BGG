						               													<description>Everything Lost is a thematic solo game set in an apocalyptic world in which you are the hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One day, you wake up. Like always, the first thing you do is open your curtains to look outside......to find out this day is different. You are stunned. Everything is lost. Your town is destroyed. Roads are gone, rubble is everywhere. Most buildings which are still standing look like skeletons. A few people are out there, stumbling goalless between the chaos, like... zombies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What is this? What happened? For how long have you been sleeping? You open your fridge. The smell! You close it fast. You feel a cold breeze. You look up. You notice almost half of your roof is missing. You&amp;rsquo;re shaking. It&amp;rsquo;s freezing. You start to feel a primal drift. You realize no one is here to help you. You have got to take care of things. Danger is out there. Instinctively you grab a tool from your toolbox and go outside.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game of Everything Lost consists of 4 chapters. In every chapter you choose 1 (out of 2 or 3) missions to play. Each mission starts at your home, the centre of town. You explore the 4 sectors surrounding your home. When you survive all 4 missions, you win. Search for food, repair your roof, steal a bulldozer and ram a warehouse, save survivors from a mall, eliminate a gang of outlaws, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next time you may follow a different path, by choosing different missions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your map you draw the city with your pencil as the game progresses. Your 5 white dice represent your energy. Use them well. If you spend a lot of dice, your chances will increase, but you will run out of dice fast. When you do, you will need to rest to get them back. This is risky. The mob will grow and events will force you to make difficult choices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Break in buildings to find useful things and weapons, search the rubble, fight zombies and look for  survivors. Convince them to join your team. Get more experienced and unlock new skills and actions. Eventually you will craft new weapons, climb buildings and attack the mob from above, or ambush them. Who&amp;rsquo;s the boss now? But only if you are a real survivor. Will you earn yourself one of the 4 available nicknames? Good luck!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
