						               													<description>The game is based on a Czech role-playing game P&amp;#197;&amp;#153;&amp;iacute;b&amp;#196;&amp;#155;hy Imp&amp;eacute;ria, which mixes steampunk, magic and alternative history together. The rules contain two variants, Power Struggle and Illuminati, and represents fight of up to six factions for power. The factions are:&amp;#10;-Freemasons (conspirational sect consisting only from men)&amp;#10;-Mages (a group using magic and the occult to achieve its goals)&amp;#10;-Industrialists (a group of scientists and factory owners relying on superior technology)&amp;#10;-Oriental Cult (which despises everything Western and plans to replace it with Eastern)&amp;#10;-S&amp;iacute;dhe (elementals from another dimensions, hungry for power they can get in our dimension)&amp;#10;-Strigois (mystical creatures called by or from the Hell itself)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each faction's deck contains 4 Characters, 2 Threats, 5 Events and 1 Shelter.&amp;#10;-Characters are the most important ones, they earn the most of the points. They can be used either as Candidates (for the post of the Prime Minister), or Agents trying to help their candidate in the elections.&amp;#10;-Threats are the means of eliminating enemy Agents, or even Candidates&amp;#10;-Shelters are for protecting from enemy Threats&amp;#10;-Events are for general purpose, either to hinder your opponents or to earn you points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In both variants, each player has his own Candidate for the post of Prime Minister, whose identity is unknown to other players. Those candidates are placed in a column face down and each round ever player puts a card face down in a row with his Candidate. After each player has placed his or her card, all those cards are revealed and resolved in a fixed order (Event, Agent, Threat, Shelter). When a player reveals an Agent, other players may guess the identity of his Candidate. If they guess right, he is revealed and that players cannot gain any points for revealing him by himself. The game continues on, regardless of a successful guess. After a playing a Threat card that will not be neutralized by a Shelte card, that player may reveal his Candidate and earns a number of points corresponding to the game's turn. If all the players' candidates are revealed (either by a guess or willingly) or if number of Threat cards on the table equals to number of players +1, the game ends. The player who caused end of the game gets extra 3 points and each player gets points for surviving of his own and killing opponents' agents. The player with the most points gets his Candidate elected as the Prime Minister,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
