						               													<description>Launching on Kickstarter on the 16th May 2023.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Go RPG is designed to give you that D&amp;amp;D/Pathfinder vibe - even when you're forced to play 'Go Fish' with your 5-year-old. Mates want to play poker? Why not play Poker skinned in RPG?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This isn't a D&amp;amp;D campaign It's a 2 in 1 combo:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Firstly it's a skin for any standard card game you play with your non-RPG friends. This is the deck of playing cards that all true D&amp;amp;Ders and RPGers should have lying around their house ready to be used on an unsuspecting NON-RPG friend or child. Acquaint them, addict them, dominate them! We have 4 decks to choose from, Heroes, Monsters, Locations &amp;amp; Equipment. Each with 14 unique cards built into a 4-suited deck of 56 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Secondly, By combining all 4 decks it will enable you to play Go RPG Campaign:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's Deckbuilding with an engine mechanic (meaning you'll want to build your deck in a way that it'll help you win the game faster.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We've playtested this game for a while now with fantastic feedback. It's simple to explain yet dynamic in its gameplay. With options for Single player right up to 7 players or using additional decks to expand the players even further. You could play this with 50 players if you really wanted to!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game styles include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Single Player&amp;#10;     Co-op play&amp;#10;     Competitive play&amp;#10;     Boss Mode where 1 of the players plays as the monster. Essentially an Evil Dungeon master!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here's how it works:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is dealt 3 hero cards, and a certain number of location cards are drawn based on the number of players. These locations represent quests from a local lord or lady regarding attacks that have been happening in that area. Players are tasked to go and kill the monsters in order to receive 1 item from the item reserve for every monster their party slays.&amp;#10;During gameplay, each player takes turns starting a round and selecting which quest they want to take. Players may entirely or partially opt-out of questing this round and instead head to the tavern to heal their party or avoid the quests that round. 2 players can go on the same quest, and the player who selected this location first will go first in attacking order. Once all players have allocated their quests, they can go and fulfil the quest by flipping over the monster cards to see what monsters they are attacking.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the game is for your party to end with the most gold value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
