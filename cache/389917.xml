						               													<description>&amp;quot;Do you know the key to hunting a Jedi, friend? It is patience.&amp;quot; -Grand Inquisitor&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last remnants of the Jedi Order tremble in fear as Inquisitors stalk them to the farthest corners of the galaxy! The Grand Inquisitor, a long-lived Pau'an, leads the Inquisitorius at Darth Vader's behest, an elite order of Force-sensitive agents strong in the dark side who hunt those who escaped the Order 66 purge. A former Jedi himself, he turned this fervor to the destruction of his former allies. He is joined in this task by Inquisitors referred to as brothers and sisters, each given a number demarking the order of their initiations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reva, the Third Sister, bold and ambitious, nurses a secret grudge against Lord Vader after surviving the slaughter of younglings at the Temple.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fifth Brother, aggressive and self-sure, is ready to strike down any who stand in his way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fourth Sister, swift and deadly, is a hunter through and through. They are the Inquisitors, and the hunt has been called.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
