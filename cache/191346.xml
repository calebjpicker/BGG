						               													<description>In a land where Heroes have battled monsters from time immemorial, a fragile peace has been forged. The fighting spirit, however, still remains. In a final effort to avoid rekindling the ages-old combat, a proposal was made: A tournament of Heroes and Monsters battling as days of old. The fame and glory of the fight without the risk of continued war. This tournament became an annual tradition, one which is now called Monsters in the Middle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monsters in the Middle is a light-weight modular card game. It features a base set of cards as well as modular cards, which are added to the game to change game play and interactions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is suitable for family play, even those with younger children.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can choose to either play a single match from the given games or a tournament consisting of several games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The games of Monster in the Middle are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Champions&amp;rsquo; Duel - in this game, players take turns competing to complete sets of cards played on the monsters to earn points. The player with the highest point total when any player plays their final card is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Grand Melee - in this game, players work at the same time, trying to be the first to play all their cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Royal Chase - in this game, players work to match the cards in their hands to the cards needed to complete a given set, capturing the Monsters and scoring points along the way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Castle Paths - in this game, players draw a hand of cards and select which order they are to play them. All players reveal each card simultaneously, comparing the value with their opponents. The player with the highest total card value wins the cards. Play to capture your opponents' treasures and rid yourself of the monsters in your deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Triumphant March - in this game, players compete to have the highest ranked hand of their opponents, wagering cards along the way to increase their chances of drawing the cards they need.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The various games of Monsters in the Middle include:&amp;#10;Set Collection&amp;#10;Take That&amp;#10;Hand Management&amp;#10;Simultaneous actions&amp;#10;Simultaneous play&amp;#10;Bluffing&amp;#10;Variable player powers&amp;#10;Grid movement&amp;#10;Card shedding&amp;#10;Note: Some games include player elimination, but in all cases where player elimination is possible, it is also an end-game condition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
