						               													<description>Power to the Meeple is a complex, euro-styled strategy game where you attempt to become the mayor of Meepletown. The primaries have just ended and up to five candidates must fight to become the winner of the general election. Whether you choose to be a punk, a Democrat, a Republican and Independent or Green party is secondary to how well you organize your campaign and come up with a lean, effective strategy to win the most votes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Power to the Meeple has three main gameplay phases. First the players participate in an augmented draft where they will be selecting resources. Most resources are just what they are, face value additions to a player's coffers. Alternatively, a player can pick lower valued resources that have abilities attached to them, which brings another balance to the player's strategy. Throughout the draft (which consists of as many rounds as players) each player is required to select one issue card which will stay with the player for the remainder of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second phase consists of each player, in turn order, deploying their five campaign tokens to the areas of the modular board they want to canvass (Urban, Estates, Eco-Buildings or Suburban areas).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the third phase, tokens are revealed and the costs of the campaign are paid with the resources drafted earlier. Players who score in the top 3 positions on an area are usually awarded votes or other bonuses. Scores at individual locations are resolved by the key value comparisons printed on the areas, and the tie breakers are done according to who drafted the tie breakers such as Megaphone, Billboard, Scandal or Town Hall.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once votes are counted, any money earned during that round are counted, players move up on their respective Urban, Suburban, Estate and Eco-Housing tracks, and lastly, discard all unused resources (besides money). All players also keep their issues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rounds 2 &amp;amp; 3 are similar to the first round, with the major difference being the advantages each player may have gained in the previous round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After 3 rounds the players resolve any pending end of game awards or penalties for the last bit of votes and a winner is declared.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
