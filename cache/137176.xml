						               													<description>The ultimate party game for family and friends, this game will have you foolin' around with your team mates no matter where you are.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You've got the friends over, dinner was great and the latest release DVD was equally good, but there's more to a great night with friends than a dinner and movie. What ever happened to fooling around and a good laugh - after all we use to do it all the time as kids?&amp;#10;Foolin' Around is a great party game for entertaining guests and getting your friends (or family) to truly 'bond', so to speak.&amp;#10;Test your impersonation, miming and balancing skills against your friends; discover how well you really know them; expose your talent for deception; find out if you are a truth or dare personality; and so much more...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whose going to score the most points?
