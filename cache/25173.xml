						               													<description>This is a game for ages 10 and up. The box contains a board, 28 cards, 5 figurines, 100 colored chips and 20 white chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board contains a circle with 8 fields, on which the figurines are moving. Next to 6 of those fields there is a field to put a card on. The cards have values between 3000 and 10000 DM and corresponding 3 to 10 fields to place chips on the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every player gets one figurine and the chips in the corresponding color. The figurines are placed on an empty field on the board and each player gets 2 white chips. The remaining white chips are placed in the middle of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards are shuttled and 6 of them are placed face up on the  discard fields.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn you can move your figurine 1 to 4 fields clockwise. The field you're ending on defines what you can do next. When you end on a field with a card laying next to it, you have to put one of your chips on the card. The fields on the card are numbered and have to be covered one by one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Do you reach the red field on the board, then you can place a chip on the card of your choice. On the blue field you can exchange a chip of your color from your supply for a white one. The white chips have a special function. During your turn only one colored chip can be placed, but on that same turn several white chips can be placed on the same card. Instead of a colored chip you can also play one white chip. White chips are neutral and don't belong to any player once they are placed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a figurine arrives at an already occupied field, the new arrival has to discard one of his chips. After that the player can continue his turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a scoring as soon as the last field of a card is covered. The player who has placed the last colored chip on that card gets the card. After that, the opposite card goes to the player who has placed the last colored chip on that card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The chips that were on those cards leave the game. New cards are placed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when no one has any chips left. The winner is the player with the highest total value on his gained cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
