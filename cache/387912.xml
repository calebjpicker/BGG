						               													<description>Guide the animal folk of the forest from their humble beginnings in the village of Thistleden as they explore new lands, develop tools and abilities, and ward off predators and dangers in this civilization-building game for 1-5 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has a 3x3 card tableau  representing their Den. During the planning phase, each player chooses a Denizen card in secret to add to their Den. Then all cards are revealed, and players place their Denizens cards in their grid, and activate all the cards in that row or column, each of which grants actions based on its type: Harvesters, Builders, Scientists, and Explorers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the round, if the row is full, the player discards two of the cards from their active row (keeping only the one they played). Discarded cards are placed in their Legacy tableau, and adding strength to future actions as their civilization grows in age and knowledge.&amp;#10; Players compete to explore new areas, build new Dens, research new technology, attract helpful Denizens and Leaders, and to defend Thistleden from threats.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from developer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
