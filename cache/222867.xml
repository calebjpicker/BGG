						               													<description>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I Mustache U is a social party game where players use cards to make predictions about each other and earn points for predicting correctly. At the end of the agreed number of rounds, the player with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, participants can either declare the leading players co-winners or have the point leaders enter an elimination round where they take turns being dealer until one player earns a point and others do not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two roles that change throughout the game: the dealer and players. Each participant begins the game with over/under and yes/no cards they use to make their predictions about the dealer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play begins when the first dealer selects a card from the stack, reads the prediction to be made, then reveals the card to all players. Each player signifies how they think the dealer will respond by placing their prediction card face-down in front of them. Once all players have locked in their predictions, the dealer reveals their answer, and players flip their prediction cards face-up. The number of correct predictions by the players will determine how many correct predictions the dealer will need to take the card and earn a point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Using the same prediction selected by the dealer, players place their answer card face-down in front of them to lock in their answers about themselves. The dealer then makes the same prediction about each player. If the dealer makes at least as many correct predictions about the players as the players made about them, the dealer places the active card in front of them, signifying they've earned one point. A tie favors the dealer, as long as they've made at least one correct prediction. Play continues by the next clockwise player becoming the dealer and drawing a new card from the stack. Whether you're looking to meet a stranger or learn very personal things about your friends, I Mustache U is an exciting experience that is sure to create memorable moments and connect people through play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
