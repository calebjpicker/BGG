						               													<description>The player becomes a roof painter in a certain town, and repaints the roofs using three colors of red, blue, and yellow in response to the instructions of the government office and requests from the residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Depending on the status of the request, the roof that was just painted blue by a colleague may be immediately repainted red.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The turn order is determined by trick taking, and chips are placed on a sheet with the image of the roof of a city. Points are scored if you can create a theme sequence consisting of three colors: red, blue, and yellow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The theme line is won on a first-come, first-served basis, so of course you want to win with tricks, but the player who was lower in the trick can also gain an advantage depending on the result of the previous player repainting the roof or the situation of the theme. Also, during the trick, players who could not follow the lead have a chance to score, making it a play that is not straightforward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
