						               													<description>I don't know why you wanted to come here out of all the places you could have taken your vacation but take heed stranger. If you thought the gangs that prowl your cities were dangerous then you obviously haven't done your homework on Transylvania. You can't go out at night for fear of running into the blood sucking Blood Leeches or the flesh eating Howlers. You even have to be careful during the day for fear of running into a member of the Stitched looking for some new body parts to create their next member. Nowhere is safe and tonight there is a full moon. The Howlers will be uncontrollable once the moon rises. If I were you I'd hop on the next train and get the hell out of here while the sun still shines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to Gangs of Transylvania a miniatures rule set for gang warfare between supernatural creatures. With this game you will be able to create your own gang of vampires, werewolves, and a host of other horror creatures to fight for the right to rule the streets of Transylvania. These rules are available as a downloadable PDF. To play each player creates a gang (generally 5-10 models) depending on a predetermined number of points.  A general game is normally around 200 pts. You'll also need at least 3 10-sided dice, a tape measure and a 3'x3' play area.  Feel free to include as much 3D terrain (buildings, trees, etc) as you like.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. MINIATURES&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a good idea to have the miniatures of all the gang members you will be using before you create your gang. It is also a good idea for all players to have miniatures that are similar in scale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. CREATION POINTS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before you can create your gang all players must decide on how many creation points will be used for gang construction. An average gang costs 200 creation points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. GANG MEMBERS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are five different types of gang members for you to choose from each with its own special rule.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. CREATURE TYPE&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Creature type refers to what type of creature the gang member is. There are ten different types of creatures to choose from. Each creature has its own unique special rule.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5. WEAPONS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you have all of your gang members chosen you need to arm them with weapons to fight with.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6. FREAK POWERS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Freak powers only apply if one of your gang members is a freak. Freaks can be given bizarre&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
