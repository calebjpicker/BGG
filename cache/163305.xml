						               													<description>In Dystopian: the adventure deck game, one to four player assume the roles of Agents of the Dystopian Police Department (DPD) who are working to solve a murder.&amp;#10;They will work together, to search the city of Dystopia, among it's many different locations, first, looking for evidence to frame a suspect, then catching the criminal, before he escapes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAMEPLAY for a 1 player game: first thing, the player will choose 1 agent, each with a specific ability, and characteristic, then he'll choose a location, from where to begin his investigation.&amp;#10;Then, the player will form the investigation deck, which is composed of a mix of encounters (people and robots -called AI-Roids- that he will talk to, interrogate or &amp;quot;simply&amp;quot; attack that will help him with the investigation, or will hinder it), locations and clues.&amp;#10;There 12 locations, and each location can either be safe, neutral or dangerous. In safe locations, encounters will tend to be friendly, or harmless, while in dangerous locations, encounters will be aggressive and will be a liability to the player. Each encounter card shows three type of behaviors, and the player applies the one, associated to the location he was met. &amp;#10;To deal with an encounter, the player will use action points. If the player has no action points, he will suffer the consequences, which will involve, eventually, spending time, and the player only has a limited amount of time/days/turns, to catch the culprit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player will have to go through the investigation deck, gaining clues and evidence, to frame the suspect, that will make the player understand where the criminal is hiding.&amp;#10;It's up to the player to determine how fast or slow he should investigate, keeping track of his action points, knowing where he's investigating, and managing his time, action points and the risks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the player has gained enough evidence (in the evidence phase) he will decide wether to keep investigating, to gain more evidence which will limit the number of locations the murderer will try to hide in, or start looking for the criminal, early on (but with more places to search him, into).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dystopian: the adventure deck game is the second installment in the dystopian trilogy, with Dystopian: the manhunt, and the soon to be finalized: Dystopian: raise and fall.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
