						               													<description>Get ready to till the soil and sow the seeds of success! In our new single player tile laying game, you will become a master farmer, harvesting crops for the most points possible. Carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes are the crops of choice, and your goal is to cultivate the most fertile fields and maximizing your harvest. With easy to learn gameplay this game will challenge you, test your skills, and bring out the farmer in you! So grab your tools, get ready to get your hands dirty, and become the top farmer in the land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pick up a random tile from the face down pile and place it down. Try to connect and chain the crop types so that you can get a higher market value for that crop. From the beginning, only one of the crops values are shown and later in the game after you scored 10 points the other two's values are revealed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
