						               													<description>From the patent description:&amp;#10;&amp;quot;A multiple player word forming game is disclosed. The game uses a board, a cup and a plurality of cards. The cards are randomly transferred to and from the players. The players use the cards to form words. In the best mode, a game board defines a flat surface bounded by a peripheral wall upon which the cup freely travels about. A player begins a turn by spinning the cup, which eventually lands upon a card transfer space. The card transfer space dictates whether the player either draws or passes cards. The player transfers cards either from the deck or to a discard pile or to or from another player during a turn. Then the player attempts to spell a word by selecting cards in his hand and laying them face-up in front of him. Opponents may challenge the player's word. Any player who transfers all of his cards during a set becomes empty-handed and may not challenge words. The number of points earned by each player is dependent upon their performance both in forming words and in manipulating the number of cards in their hand. Preferably, a chance card multiplies the number of points a player can get. The set ending player's total score is doubled if the player ended the set with the chance card. Other player's scores are multiplied by zero if they held the chance card when an opponent ended the set.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In English, players use a cup shaped spinner that will move around the 5x5 board to determine card movement between the players. Players have to build words from their available cards and score points displayed on the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
