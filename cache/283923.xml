						               													<description>Gale&amp;atilde;o Fantasma (Ghost Galleon)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are reports of mysterious events at Perna de Pau's Cove. &amp;#10;Are numerous rumors that the Ghost Galleon, with a valuable cargo of gold coming from Spain, has just reappeared by the beach. &amp;#10;Rival area pirates are immediately scheduled on a plank and steal the treasure hidden behind the stories of the ghost of the Blackbeard, who presents himself in its protected and invaluable treasure.&amp;#10;Who is the first pirate with enough courage to go to the Ghost Galleon, search all my treasure chests for the treasure and take him to his hiding place?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal of the game&amp;#10;Be the first pirate to return to his hiding place with the gold pieces of the treasure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Moving your pirate&amp;#10;Roll two dice and advance as many houses as the sum of both dice.&amp;#10; You can not go to another pirate's hideaway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Caves&amp;#10;There are four caves on the beach (marked with lanterns) with secret passages between them. Allow skirted the board faster.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The approach to the Ghost Galleon&amp;#10;Follow the black arrow on the beach to opposite black arrow. &amp;#10;Go around the galleon in the same direction as you walked along the beach.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Ghost of the Blackbeard&amp;#10;You can move it whenever you get a 6 at the die roll. Use it to help you get in the way of the others.&amp;#10;He can never leave Galleon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Houses with cannon and houses with cannonballs&amp;#10;To shoot a cannon, the Phantom must move to the house directly behind that cannon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Board&amp;#10;When the Phantom comes home next to yours (he can stop there even if he has not finished the sum of the data), or when you arrive at a house after his, or if you are in a cabin when he enters, you are immediately taken spiritually to walk on the board, Ha, ha, hal !! &amp;#10;When you have recovered from the shock (ie lost in turn), you are saved by a barrel passing through there. Jump to the barrel of your color and start your journey from there.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Search and Obtaining the Treasure&amp;#10;You must keep one or more keys that will open the treasure chests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Entrance into the Haunted Cabin&amp;#10;Enter the path of the door (marked with an arrow). You can not enter if the Ghost or other pirate there.&amp;#10;Remove the round silhouette from the top of the hill. Hold any key face down or the Parrot with face up in front of you.&amp;#10;Devessair and re-enter the Haunted Cabin in new turns if you want to catch another circular silhouette.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The parrot&amp;#10;When you catch the Parrot, immediately:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     withdraws at random any silhouette belonging to another player;&amp;#10;     remove a key from the Haunted Cabin, even if there is the Ghost;&amp;#10;     look under any of the chests to see which key opens and future references.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In subsequent times, the player who has the Parrot may prefer not to cast the dice, but to repeat 1, 2 or 3.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Ghost of the Blackbeard and his Parrot&amp;#10;If the Ghost moves to next to the pirate who has the Parrot, the Blackbeard sends the parrot back to the Haunted Cabin, where it is placed on the top of the hill of circular silhouettes. Then the pirate walks on the board!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Entrance into the booths with treasure chests&amp;#10;Enter in the same way as described for Haunted Cabin&amp;#10;The bottom of each ark shows what key is needed to open it. Remember this for future references, or if you already have a matching key (with 2 or 3 teeth) prove it to the other players showing them your key and the bottom of the ark. Then open the ark, secretly remove the silhouette (if you still there is one) look at it and keep it face down in front of you. Replace the lid on the chest and&amp;#10;put it back in the cabin. One of the chests does not need a key - just remove the silhouette.&amp;#10;The split key is unnecessary and does not open any ark!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Duels&amp;#10;Duels are an exciting way to gain weapons, treasure, keys and the Parrot of other pirates.&amp;#10;If you wish to challenge an opponent to a duel, move to the house next to his (do not need to come with exact number) and shout: &amp;quot;Choose the weapons&amp;quot;! You can not challenge him to a duel if he's in a cabin or in his refuge.&amp;#10;Both display the silhouette of a weapon, face up, if you have it. Then roll the dice to decide the outcome of the duel:&amp;#10; * a player with a pistol throws the three dice.&amp;#10; * a player with a sword throws two dice.&amp;#10; * a player without weapons or with a broken sword casts a die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The highest value of a single dice designates the winner.&amp;#10;The winner removes any of the silhouettes or the parrot (if any) from the loser along with both weapons used in the duel.&amp;#10;The winner can then, if he wishes, change places with the loser.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winner of the game&amp;#10;The first pirate to arrive at his own refuge, having found the treasure is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
