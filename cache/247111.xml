						               													<description>Vanquisher is a game of abstract territorial control, engine building, and city building. Players take on the role of kings competing to fill newly discovered land with their own buildings, while trying to block others from doing the same. Each player will use resources, bribe officials, and send armies in order to create the dominant kingdom and claim the land as their own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Vanquisher, players will take turns performing actions and constructing buildings in a limited map area. The area consists of a grid, where players will place their newly constructed buildings. But careful planning is essential, since buildings can only be constructed without them touching, a specification that can be used to a player&amp;rsquo;s advantage. Each constructed building will also give a special benefit to the player which they can use throughout the game to assist them in collecting resources, using army tokens to block other players, and allow them to use additional actions during their turns. A player can additionally use actions to bribe officials, which take form of cards that will assist them in creating a more efficient engine to claim the most land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after 12 rounds, and players get points from territorial control, and bonus points for achievements, money, and certain buildings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game was made available as a free Print and Play by Ngb Designs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Game:&amp;#10;In a realm much like our own, Kings search for undiscovered territory to expand their kingdom. News has spread of new land found far across the mountains, and Kings now rush to claim it as their own and vanquish others along the way.&amp;#10;Vanquisher is a strategic kingdom building game. Players take turns constructing buildings, growing their armies, and bribing officials in order to spread their influence on the unclaimed territory. It is up to the players to manage their resources to help grow their kingdom, and stop others from growing theirs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
