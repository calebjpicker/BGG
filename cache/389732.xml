						               													<description>Run away! Tonkatsusaurus is a team based game for 4 or 6 players.  Each player is assigned a certain food-themed creature variant, such as a tonkatsusaurus, with two players, on opposite teams, both having variants on the tonkatsusaurus - with and without sauce!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has a card showing their animal in front of them, and there is a deck which contains cards corresponding to each animal - though the two tonkatsusauruses share one type of card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, the players are playing cards from their hand into a pyramid shape. To play a card, it must have two supporting cards, and one of them must be the same type. You could also move your animal into the pyramid; it will be worth points equal to the level where it is placed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before placing it into the pyramid, a player can also activate their animal to move a card from lower in the pyramid to higher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The team with the highest sum of points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
