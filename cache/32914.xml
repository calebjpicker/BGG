						               													<description>You've all wondered about it. Some have even argued about it. Now you can play it for yourself to see which side would win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game was developed to help cross-understanding of the two different chess systems.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One side plays with the Western Chess pieces, the other with the Chinese Chess pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Due to the differences in western and eastern chess boards, both halves of the board retain the characteristics of each side. The number of squares have been increased to accommodate the slightly larger Chinese chess board. A central row on the Chinese chess side terminates at the &amp;quot;river&amp;quot; to merge into the western chess board. Units playing at the central row interface play as per normal but with a termination at the end of the row. Bishops and Queen moving along the diagonal will side-step across the central row to maintain the same colour of squares.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because of Eastern initial advantage checkmating with catapults in first move, West starts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All usual rules apply.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Western - King - 1 step in any direction&amp;#10;     Eastern - ji&amp;agrave;ng/shuai (General/Marshal) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)&amp;#10;     Western - Queen - moves diagonally and vertically/horizontally&amp;#10;     Eastern - sh&amp;igrave; (Scholar/Official) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)&amp;#10;     Western - Bishop - moves diagonally&amp;#10;     Eastern -  xi&amp;agrave;ng (Elephant/Minister) - moves in 2 step diagonals (blocked by a piece along its diagonal) (cannot cross river)&amp;#10;     Western - Knight - moves in 2/1 step &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; (blocked by a piece along the long side of the &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; when in Eastern territory)&amp;#10;     Eastern - ma(Horse/Cavalry) - moves in 2/1 step &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; ( blocked by a piece along the long side of &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; when in Eastern territory)&amp;#10;     Western - Castle - moves vertically/diagonally&amp;#10;     Eastern - ju (Chariot/Wagon) - moves vertically/diagonally&amp;#10;     Eastern - pao (Catapult/Cannon) - moves vertically/horizontally, takes enemy piece by leaping over another piece&amp;#10;     Western - Pawn - 1 step forward, takes enemy piece 1 step diagonally (1 or 2 step opening move)&amp;#10;     Eastern -zu/bing (Private/Soldier) - 1 step forward (across the river, 1 step vertically/horizontally)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other rules;&amp;#10;Western Chess Unique Rules&amp;#10;1. Castling&amp;#10;2. Pawns resurrect to any previously &amp;quot;taken&amp;quot; piece upon reaching the end of board &amp;lt;-- no longer applies&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Chinese Chess Unique Rules&amp;#10;1. Horses/Cavalry are blocked by pieces straddling the long leg of L &amp;lt;-- only within Eastern Territory&amp;#10;2. Elephants/Ministers are blocked by pieces straddling the diagonal&amp;#10;3. Privates/Soldiers can move horizontally upon crossing the river&amp;#10;4. General/Marshal and Shi cannot exit the fortress except when jumping out to kill opposing King in direct line of sight&amp;#10;5. Elephants/Ministers cannot cross the river&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some Game specific basic notes:&amp;#10;1. West always moves first (or East checkmates with his catapult in 1 move)&amp;#10;2. Korean Chess rules will be used in the case of the Eastern General and both Shi. They can now move both horizontally and diagonally along the fortress lines&amp;#10;3. The Eastern General retains the ability to jump in order to &amp;quot;take&amp;quot; the Western King but not vice-versa so the Western King needs to avoid &amp;quot;seeing&amp;quot; the Eastern General&amp;#10;4. The Western horse upon crossing the river into Eastern territory, will be subjected to the same blocking (horse-leg) rule as Eastern cavalry whilst in Eastern territory&amp;#10;5. The Eastern cavalry upon crossing the river into Western territory, will no longer be subjected to the blocking (horse-leg) rule whist in Western territory&amp;#10;6. The Western pawn no longer has the ability to upgrade to another previously &amp;quot;taken&amp;quot; piece upon reaching the end as it does so within the Eastern board&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An article on the game was published in the German daily &amp;quot;Neues Deutschland&amp;quot; (transl.: &amp;quot;New Germany&amp;quot;), 22nd September 2007. http://www.nd-online.de/artikel.asp?AID=116589&amp;amp;IDC=27&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For more info: http://www.act.com.sg/eastvswest/&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
