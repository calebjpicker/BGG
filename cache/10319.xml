						               													<description>From the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, it is possible for everyone in your family to enjoy all the fun and excitement of one of television's newest and highest rated shows with the new home version of &amp;quot;The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime&amp;quot; game. Players compete against one and other to solve the clues which will allow them a try at the word puzzle board. The tension and excitement builds as players race to be the first to figure out the clues and solve the word puzzle, but beware of the stinger. With one sting you can lose a valuable, and possibly, a game winning turn. So gather your family and friends around and enjoy the newest and exciting game you will ever play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;User review:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played by two players or teams while one additional player acts as gamemaster. The players play three puzzle phrases and the one with more money is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin each puzzle phrase, the gamemaster uses console to show the players which letters of the alphabet are contained in the puzzle phrase with one additional false letter called &amp;ldquo;The Stinger.&amp;rdquo; The gamemaster uses the wipe-off board to indicate the phrase missing its letters as one would in the game of Hangman.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player may choose two letters from the console to have those letters placed in their proper positions on the wipe-off board by correctly guessing a clue word. The gamemaster  shows the number of letters there are in the clue word on the wipe-off board and then places them one at a time until one team guessed the word. Guessing the clue word gives the right to have a chance to guess the puzzle phrase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When choosing letters from the console, money is added to the jackpot: $25 per letter during the first puzzle phrase, $50 per letter in the second, and $100 per letter in third. Should the player choose The Stinger with either choice the player may not guess at the puzzle phase and the game continues with a new clue word. The jackpot is won by guessing the puzzle phrase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While promoted on the show (albeit with a different box during Season 1) and mostly faithful to it, the home adaptation turns the show's giant computer and keyboard into a dry-erase board and a set of plastic tiles (later cardboard letters). The bonus round is not present, either, instead awarding the Million if a player or team wins all three rounds in a game. Further, only 48 puzzles are present, allowing for just 16 games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Notably, the game also included a contestant application, which is somewhat amusing since the game was given to couples who appeared on the show.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
