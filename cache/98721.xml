						               													<description>Contains 110 cards... everything you need for 2 or 4 players to play anywhere using a single deck! It is fast, easy, fun and FULL OF DOOOOOM! Created by Artix and the team, this card game is fast, easy, crazy fun. Spend a little quality time away from the computer screen with the family, or duel your friends during lunch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everyone starts with 20 Health. (Use 10 for a quick game!). Each player gets 7 cards. The deck goes face down between the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On YOUR TURN...&amp;#10;DRAW! - At the very start of your turn, discard as many cards as you want into the discard pile, then draw until you have 7 cards total in your hand. After you are done drawing, play as many cards as you want in any order! EQUIP ITEMS - Some cards, like Armors and Pets say, &amp;ldquo;Equip on your turn&amp;rdquo;. To equip a card, place it face up in front of you. Equipped cards remain in play until the end of the game unless your foe finds a way to remove it, or you choose to discard it during your turn. You can equip as many cards as you want on your turn, however, you can only have 1 Armor and 1 Pet equipped at the same time. If you equip a new one, the old one is discarded. ATTACK! During your turn you can make only 1 Weapon or Spell attack and also 1 Pet attack. Add as many enhancements as you want to any attack to increase damage! If you have armor equipped, check to see if it increases your attack&amp;rsquo;s damage even more. Declare all of your attacks at the same time and when you are done, ask your opponent if they can defend against it. After everything is concluded, all cards used during the attack are discarded. (Except equipped Pets and Armors of course.) BLOCKED!? Use a Counter card to undo a block, trap or even another counter! There may be other creative ways to prevent them from stopping your attack too - read your cards carefully and exploit the rules! ANYTHING GOES! - During your turn you may play as many of your cards as you want. Cards will tell you when and how you can use them. Cards that say &amp;ldquo;ANYTIME&amp;rdquo; can be used, literally, at any time... even if it is not your turn... even if the card is still in your hand... and especially if it messes up something your opponent was trying to do! (Example: Stealing their pet with a trap card the moment they try to attack you with it. How rude!) END YOUR TURN - Say &amp;ldquo;Done!&amp;rdquo;, or something like that. This officially ends your turn and starts theirs!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On THEIR TURN&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;MESS UP THEIR ATTACKS &amp;amp; ACTIONS! Use blocks, traps and card special abilities to reduce or prevent damage. If something says &amp;ldquo;ANYTIME&amp;rdquo; you can literally use it at anytime. The most important rule of the game: The cards you play will change whatever just happened. (Example: If you get a chance to steal you foe&amp;rsquo;s armor while they are trying to use its special ablility... go for it!)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WIN!&amp;#10;If you run out of cards, reshuffle the discard pile into the deck and continue taking turns until your opponent is reduced to 0 health and you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
