						               													<description>From the rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;UTENSILS. A pack of Red, White and Blue Cards, called Route Tickets, four STEAMSHIPS for travel on the water, and four TRAINS with Engines of color corresponding to the ships, for travel in Europe. It will be noticed that the trains of cars used in playing this game are like the European trains in appearance. Each player should take one STEAMSHIP and one TRAIN OF CARS of the same color. Each player should in turn draw a Red Ticket, without looking at it previously to taking it in his hand, and should put the prow of his Steamship upon the Red spot indicating the City first named on that ticket and from which port he is to sail. When traveling upon the WATER, Use the Steamship ; when going from CITY TO CITY IN EUROPE, each player should use his train as his piece, removing his Steamship from the board as soon as he begins to use his Train, and removing his train from the board when he again uses his Steamship. A player should put the front part of his Train on the City at which he is supposed to be. When ON THE WATER he should use the prow of his ship to indicate his position.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PLAYERS HAVING MADE THE FIRST MOVE continue in turn to move their pieces to the next place mentioned on their respective ROUTE TICKETS, thus: A player drawing the Route Ticket New York, Storm, Queenstown, Liverpool, and London: will it five moves, reach the latter point (using the Steamship from New York to Liverpool, then removing the Steamship front the board, and playing his Railroad Train from Liverpool to London). A player drawing the ticket New York, Rescue, Southampton and London, will, in four moves, reach the latter City, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players who prefer to use ordinary pieces instead of the Steamships and Trains of Cars, may use the four wooden pieces enclosed in the game, but if the Steamships and Trains are used, the wooden pieces are not. As a player moves his pieces, he must call out the place or city to which he moves. When a player reaches the last City named on his Ticket, he throws his Red Ticket aside (as it is not used again in the game), and continues to play and draw front White Tickets until he reaches Constantinople.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a ticket has been used it is thrown into a discarded pile or placed under the bottom of the stack from which it was originally drawn. The players, by this process, eventually reach CONSTANTINOPLE, which is the turning point of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;AFTER REACHING CONSTANTINOPLE, a player must draw Blue Route Tickets, which will eventually bring him back to Boston or New York. The player making a TOUR OF EUROPE, as far as Constantinople, and first arriving at the last City mentioned on his return card (either Boston or New York), WINS THE GAME.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It will be seen that a player may make the trip very quickly, or that it may take a long time. The first Red Card that he draws will take him across the Ocean, but he may have to play upon the cities mentioned on several WHITE Cards before he reaches Constantinople, and he may draw several Blue Route Tickets after reaching Constantinople ere he gets back to Boston or New York.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;N. B. &amp;mdash; Players must move on EVERY City mentioned on EVERY Route Card they draw. Players can only move to the next City mentioned on Their Route Card, in one turn, therefore it will take six turns to reach the last City mentioned on a card having six names of Cities, etc. The red dots on the Ocean, such as Storm, Rescue, Fog, etc., supposed to represent incidents in the ocean trip, are used in the game exactly as the cities are.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GOING TO DINNER. It sometimes occurs that Two players meet in the same City, in which case they go to DINNER together, that is, both pieces are put upon the Dinner space, or picture, in the corner of the board. Players do NOT remain upon the Dinner space but remove to the next City on their routes (the Dinner only being an incident in their journey).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It does not require a SEPARATE turn to go to Dinner, the pieces being immediately placed on the Dinner picture on their meeting in any foreign City. Remember that you draw a Red Ticket on the first turn only. The White Tickets are used to carry you to Constantinople, and the Blue ones to bring you home. This will be easily remembered from the order, Red, White and Blue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board (from the 1st edition) sits on top of a wood framed bottom and there is a sliding drawer in the side for the game pieces to go into. The 2nd edition comes without sliding drawer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
