						               													<description>Traxit is an abstract boardgame , where the goal is to be a close to the top during the 4 scoring rounds. The catch is that your opponent on your right decides which of 16 movement tiles you have to use for your next movement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has 2 pawns and 16 movementtiles. Give the movementtiles to the player on your right, and place your pawns anywhere on the lower level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You opponent choose which movementtile to give to you, and you have to use that path, although you can rotate it an way you like. After using the movemnettile it's discarded. You can't move through other pawns, nor outside the board, and if you can't move at all, your opponent must take one of your pawns and move it any space on the lowest level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each 4th round (4, 8, 12 and 16) you score points for the position of your pawns (0, 25, 50 or 100) depending on how close to the top you are. There is also a bonus for managing to get your pawns to the highest level at any time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is also a short version of the game, wher you only play 12 of the 16 movementtiles, and a team variant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
