						               													<description>Fognik is a small but powerfully enchanted land.  The Four Towers of Fognik are home to the highest level of enlightenment that a mortal can achieve.  However, over the last age the Four Towers were mysteriously abandoned and Fognik left in disarray.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You and a small group of other demigods have come to rule Fognik and restore the Four Towers to its rightful place as a center of power.  There can be only one ultimate ruler of this magical land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Four clans of humans and a myriad of mysterious creatures inhabit Fognik.&amp;#10;You can claim your power by having followers and using your influence to enlighten worthy peasants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Those that climb beyond the blue mountains shall be enlightened and will reside in one of the four towers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Those that claim the fiery depths of the red gorge shall find themselves cast as demons in the underworld.  The power of the underworld is strong and every new demon that turns to the depths of darkness also dims the light and casts a lord from the four towers into the depths.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Train some of the humans as mercenaries, merchants and mountaineers to help your cause.  Sacrifice your followers in the champion&amp;rsquo;s temple to gain the will of powerful creatures that inhabit this strange and varied land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you can use all of the tools at your disposal you could rule this mystical place and control the Four Towers!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Four Towers is played on a concentric grid laid out on a map of the four clans domain.  Each turn a player places one peasant from any of the four clans on the grid and places two other peasants as followers or as one of the three occupations; mercenaries, merchants or minstrels.  The grid represents the power struggle for control.  Peasants that make it to the outer circle of the grid become lords while those that gravitate towards the center go to the underworld and become demons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players collect followers as a means of supporting and predicting which clan will have the most lords.  Mercenaries, merchants and minstrels each score influence points at the end of the game while also presenting additional capabilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sixteen unique champion cards each with their own special skill and/or bonus point structure helps to make every game completely unique and presents an enormous number of paths to success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are calculated by multiplying each clans followers by the number of lords, calculating the bonuses from the champion cards and collecting influence points from the different occupations.  The player with the most points is victorious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
