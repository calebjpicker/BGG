						               													<description>Fast and furious card game.&amp;#10;There are 52 cards in four suits of service personnel. The four services are The Royal Navy, The Army, The Royal Air Force, and The Women's Auxiliary Territorial Services.&amp;#10;Deal out all the cards after shuffling. Each player does not look at their cards but makes a face-down pile in front of him. At the start players turn over their top card as fast as they can. Any number 1 card is placed in the middle of the table. From then on, you can earn 'Promotion' by playing a number 2 card of the same suit, then a number 3 card, and so on. The cards in the middle must be the right service to gain 'promotion', but you can also discard a card on any other player's face-up pack, obeying the promotion rule of the next highest card, but as it is not promoting a card in the middle of the table, any promotion card, regardless of suit can be played.&amp;#10;Play should be fast, because there are many penalty card laws and the rules say &amp;quot;The fun of the game relies on penalties being enforced&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards is the winner.&amp;#10;The cards feature the insignia of rank in each of the four services. There is also a number in the corner of the cards so if you do not know the ranking, you can just remember to play the next higher card in that service. &amp;#10;The box exhorts players &amp;quot;Learn to spot the ranks&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;This is a patriotic game in that players, especially children, were very interested in all things military. I would date the game as 1918 because the RAF (Royal Air Force) didn't exist before April that year. Previously it was the RFC (Royal Flying Corps)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
