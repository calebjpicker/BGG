						               													<description>Angry Birds Lunar Launcher and Planet Base play set. Based on the best-selling phone app game, Angry Birds, kids can now play their favourite app game in real life! This set offers two different ways to play - you can mount the planet base on the wall (using the included 3M Command strip technology) or place it on a table. The gravity-defying blocks and pigs and a handheld launcher allow kids to build, launch and destroy like never before! Includes: handheld launcher, planet base station, mounting bracket, 3 popular Angry Birds, 3 pigs, 10 blocks and bonus pieces and 2 x 3M Command strips. Suitable for ages 5+.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object:  To score points by knocking down pigs, blocks and bonus pieces to score the most points.Level 1&amp;bull;  Decide who will build the castle on the planet base and who will launch birds to    try and knock it down!&amp;bull;  Build a castle on the Planet Base.  You may design your castle any way you want,     but you must use ALL the blocks, pigs and bonus pieces.&amp;bull;  Launch the birds at the castle.  You get three tries, one for each bird.When launching a bird, hold the launcher in one hand, and then put your finger in the launcher ring to pull it back.  Then let go and watch it fly!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any pig you knock off is worth 2 points, and any bonus piece you knock off is  worth one point. NOTE:  if the pig or bonus piece    is still attached to a block when you  knock  it off, it still counts.&amp;bull;  Add up your points, then switch roles so that the player who launched the birds now builds the castle, and the person who built the castle will now launch the birds.&amp;bull;  After both players have had a chance to score points, compare the results.  The player with the highest score wins the round.&amp;bull;  If there is a tie score, the round doesn&amp;rsquo;t count and you must play it over.&amp;bull;  First player to win 2 rounds is the winner!Level 2&amp;bull;  Level 2 is exactly the same game play as Level 1 but the scoring is different.  It&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated but there&amp;rsquo;s also a      chance for more points!&amp;bull;  Just like in Level 1, you have 3 chances (1 for each bird) to knock things off.  But in Level 2, you also get points for knocking off    blocks!  Also, EVERYTHING is worth more points.&amp;bull;  Pigs are worth 75 points, Long Blocks are worth 50 points, Short Blocks are worth 25 points and Bonus Pieces are worth 10     points. &amp;bull;  Just like in Level 1, compare points to determine the winner of each round.   If there is a tie score, the round doesn&amp;rsquo;t count and    you must play it over.&amp;bull;  First player to win 2 rounds is the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
