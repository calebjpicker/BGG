						               													<description>The town of Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Ridge is being threatened by a powerful Dark Lord and its deadly Minions. The call has gone out for a Hero to rise up and undertake a series of Quests, each designed to bring ruin to the Dark Lord&amp;rsquo;s dark plans. Do you have what it takes to solve the Quests before Darkness consumes Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Ridge and its inhabitants?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MyQuest is a solo game designed to allow you to explore a fantasy town and its surrounding wilds in an attempt to thwart the plans of the enemy - a Dark Lord and its deadly Minions. Players choose from one of six different Heroes and must undertake 3 Quests, chosen at random from a deck of 30 Quest cards. Before the game begins, one of 10 different Dark Lord cards will be selected (at random) for the player to rise up against, each with a unique power and the command over one of four different Minion types: infernal demons, unrelenting undead, savage beasts, or elemental primordials. In this way, the game will offer variety each time it is played, as the Quests, Heroes and enemies can be different.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Heroes must overcome terrible Misfortune cards that get in their way and will even have to face Encounter cards that provide various skill checks that they will have to master. The central mechanic for the game revolves around rolling six-sided dice and trying to get at least one 5-6 to pass the myriad of tests facing each Hero. From the spoils of their victories in battle and chance encounters, Heroes will also earn gold that can be used in town to heal wounds, remove curses, buy items of power, and sail to distant spots on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But time is not on the player's side, for the Threat of Evil track grows as Minions reach the town square or certain cards are drawn from the Misfortune deck. Does your Hero have what it takes to battle back against the likes of Evil such as the Demon Prince, Insane Horror, Ancient Dragon, Troll King, or Lich (to name a few)? Only the brave, cunning and quick will be victorious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
