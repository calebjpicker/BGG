						               													<description>This is the first board game that's not fair for all players, or as we call them &amp;quot;Victims&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Victim starts off with the maximum assistance allowed by FEMA in the amount of $26,200.00. If you start off as a &amp;quot;family of one&amp;quot; maybe you can win, but those who start off as a &amp;quot;family of three or more&amp;quot; could become homeless 'fast,' and with all the city ,state, and federal red tape built in this game... &amp;quot; you will see why victims of Katrina continue to have such a hard time&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You must move carefully around the board, and hope you don't land on the red cross where you will hold until they answer the phone. As you may find out as a Katrina victim you could wait a &amp;quot;life time&amp;quot;. You can even be unlucky and pull the card that says &amp;quot;Former First Lady Barbara Bush thinks your happier living in Texas&amp;quot; and be forced to stay in the Astro Dome. But, there is some hope if you win a federal case against FEMA, you could be awarded additional assistance.  Who knows??&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We hope this game is a reminder of the worst natural disaster ever to hit the U.S. and the worst governmental response to a U.S. Disaster. The Victims still need your support.  Through the purchase of this game, you will be assisting in this, as we are donating a portion of each sale to Katrina relief organizations which are continuing to assist real victims.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
