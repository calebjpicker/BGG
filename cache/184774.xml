						               													<description>Src:Card is a standalone 1-2 player (2-4 with expansion) card game that challenges players to build their own super robot core while attacking their opponent by writing code. Make your robot core as formidable as possible while creating code to attack and anticipate changes to your opponent's network. Src:Card is made for anyone interested in programming who has a love of gaming.  Birthed from a love of German style boardgames, computer strategy games and too much time programming, Src:Card incorporates real coding concepts that are challenging for experts and easy to learn for beginners.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Src:Card players have statement (method, bug and structure) cards and cybernetic core cards in their hand throughout the game.  At the beginning of a turn a player will draw a new card. A player has the opportunity to harden the core of his/her robot's cybernetic core by adding nodes and firewall components.  Each player must balance increased strength attributes against the vulnerabilities that new core cards present. Each player desires to harden his/her robot's core as much as possible while delaying the eight card &amp;quot;boot-up&amp;quot; threshold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the same time, players are creating code using actual programming items to defeat their opponent's super robot. The placement of different loops, varying conditional statements and a multitude of functions allows each player to create dynamic, ever changing instructions of attack against their opponent. All components can be nested and with the addition of expansion packs, new functions and additional players are added to the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player has passed the 8-card &amp;quot;boot-up&amp;quot; threshold, their robot is alive and is open to attack from its opponents. Should an opponent defeat your robot, they will be victorious. However should you do the same, you will neutralise the threat of that nation&amp;rsquo;s super robot and claim victory for your realm!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
