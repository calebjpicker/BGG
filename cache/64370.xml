						               													<description>A colorful game board of the world&amp;rsquo;s continents illustrating castles, sunken ships, lost cities, strange creatures, famous jewels and storied treasures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players choose a colorful token and travel various pathways collecting the treasures on the game board.  The game is designed for easy set up with a playing time of about thirty minutes.  Information regarding the world&amp;rsquo;s treasures will pique the interest of all playing. The game is straight forward in play with each participant trying to acquire as many treasures as they can as quickly as possible.  Wealth is accumulated by seizing treasure tokens, retaining situation cards of value, and collecting treasure notes.  For those who enjoy a quick search of facts, an informative twenty-page booklet listing historical finds of treasure has been provided.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Treasure Trove was created to provide an opportunity for parents and grandparents to sit down together with older children and enjoy a board game that is not too time consuming.  The game was designed to invite the interest of all ages targeting 7-12 year old.  The theme of treasure was chosen because it fascinates people of all ages.  The game has unique colorful player tokens, and the multiple treasures allow each player to collect their share in the process of playing the game.  An element of strategy is evident, but there is enough chance and luck to prevent that from dominating the game.  The beginning player has just as much chance of winning as one who has played often.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is designed to be colorful and imaginative. Any quest for treasure entails adventure.  Illustrations of strange animals, castles, lost cities, sunken ships, and temples add to the experience of traveling the world in search of treasure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 72 situation cards that keep the game entertaining. Historical facts, tales of wealth and hidden truths about treasure are revealed in the cards.  Some contain as much value as the treasure pieces, while others cause the loss of a turn or opportunity to move to another location on the board, adding to the element of chance.  Some of the cards are witty to keep the game light-hearted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
