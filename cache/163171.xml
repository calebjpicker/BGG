						               													<description>Super Turbo bitCrawl FX: Alpha Xtreme is a co-op game designed for 1-8 players in which our heroes venture through a dungeon in search of treasure, adventure and eventually the BOSS FIGHT!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, players are given a choice of eight classes within the standard four fantasy archetypes: Mage, Priest, Rogue, and Warrior. Each class has a specific number of starting dice for basic attack and agility rolls and class specific skill that is unique for each of the eight classes. After players have chosen their class they are tasked with selecting the skills that their character will possess for the duration of the game. There are eight double-sided ability inserts available to each archetype allowing for a total of 24 unique versions of each of the available eight classes. Players then select their portrait and sprite representation for this game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once players have selected their class, abilities, and portrait, the players select the boss they will face at the end of the game. There are two bosses in the base game, along with eight abilities for the bosses to possess. This allows for a total of 48 unique bosses that the players can encounter at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once set-up has completed, our heroes embark on their adventure through the dungeon. &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;A turn is divided into two phases. The first phase is the exploration phase during this phase each hero has 3 exploration actions that they can take. These include things such as moving into a new tile,  scrounging rooms for treasure, equipping items and resting to name a few. After each hero has taken their three exploration actions it is now time for the encounter phase. Random targeting determines where the encounter(s) will be taking place, the hero(es) that have been assigned an encounter will roll the encounter die to determine what they will have to contend with, be it monsters, events or nothing at all. During the encounter phase each hero is allowed one action and the encounter phase does not end until all monsters have been defeated. After the monsters have been dealt with the heroes gain experience and divvy up the treasure.  The &amp;quot;Player One&amp;quot; marker is moved all heroes move their special ability dice closer to the ready and the new player one starts the turn with their three exploration actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The dungeon and all things in it, including the boss, are designed to scale based on the number of heroes playing and the highest level hero in the dungeon. As heroes level up they gain additional attack or agility dice and their special abilities require less of a cool down between uses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base game includes 26 hex tiles, which the heroes reveal as they explore the dungeon. The boss fight is triggered by the random pull of one of these tiles that is labeled &amp;quot;BOSS FIGHT!!!&amp;quot; when this tile is entered all heroes teleport to the tile to do battle with the boss. STbCFX:AX is a co-op game at its core but does allow for a competitive element tied to the value of the treasure that the heroes collect while exploring the dungeon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
