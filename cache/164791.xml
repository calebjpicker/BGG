						               													<description>Hetsugigawa no Tatakai is the fifth entry in the Sengoku Folio battle game series. It's a doujinshi (self-published) game similar in tone to the early SPI folio games-low numbers of counters, compact map, and an easy-to-learn game system used for all the entries in the series. The full name is &amp;quot;Hetsugigawa No Tatakai: Toyotomi (Sengoku) X Shimazu-1587.1.20 (&amp;#230;&amp;#136;&amp;#184;&amp;#230;&amp;#172;&amp;#161;&amp;#229;&amp;#183;&amp;#157;&amp;#227;&amp;#129;&amp;#174;&amp;#230;&amp;#136;&amp;#166;&amp;#227;&amp;#129;&amp;#132;: &amp;#232;&amp;#177;&amp;#138;&amp;#232;&amp;#135;&amp;#163;&amp;#227;&amp;#128;&amp;#128;(&amp;#228;&amp;#187;&amp;#153;&amp;#231;&amp;#159;&amp;#179;) X &amp;#229;&amp;#179;&amp;#182;&amp;#230;&amp;#180;&amp;#165;&amp;#227;&amp;#128;&amp;#128;1587.1.20, Battle Of Hetsugigawa: Toyotomi (Sengoku) Vs. Shimazu-1587/1/20)&amp;quot;. In this case, the 'Sengoku' in parenthesis doesn't mean 'Warring States' (pronounced the same, different kanji) but rather is the name of the Toyotomi commander who provoked the battle with a foolhardy assault.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After responding to a request for aid against the Shimazu by the Otomo, Toyotomi Hideyoshi prepared a huge army to take the island of Kyushu. His vanguard consisted of forces from the Sengoku and Chosokabe (around 20,000 in all)-they entered Bungo province in NE Kyushu and were instructed to stay on the defensive until the Toyotomi main body arrived. Instead, samurai being samurai and not inclined to listen to anyone, Sengoku Hisahide decided to attempt the relief of nearby Toshimitsu Castle (then being besieged by the Shimazu). The Chosokabe protested but eventually joined the assault, figuring that if Sengoku was determined to go through with the assault it would be better to join in than to sit by doing nothing. However, the Shimazu were aware of their advance and increased their efforts to take the castle, laying claim to it before the Toyotomi forces arrived. Undeterred, the Toyotomi forces (also with elements of the Otomo and Sogou, about 7,000 in all) gathered for battle on the 12th day of the 12th month of the 14th year of Tenshou (January 20, 1587). The Shimazu (with a large number of allies from the Ijuuin, the force adding up to about 15,000) provoked an attack with a feigned retreat (a favorite Shimazu tactic), luring the Toyotomi into an ambush and routing their forces. The Toyotomi withdrew from Bungo and this was to be the high point of the Shimazu-things would be far different when the Toyotomi main force arrived.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle is played out in eight turns. Victory is determined by both enemy casualties and possession of the two castles on the field. Counters are rated for morale, combat strength (melee), and marksmanship (in this case, the arquebus). The Toyotomi forces face a tough fight as they're outnumbered almost two to one by a Shimazu force with superior morale. Thankfully, they aren't required to be be as stupid as Sengoku Hisahide.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
