						               													<description>Welcome to Yokai Quest&amp;#10;Yokai Quest is a game where players lead a group of heroes who must face a multitude&amp;#10;of enemies and dangers.&amp;#10;The main enemies of the heroes are the Yokai, mythological creatures from Japanese&amp;#10;folklore. Each Yokai has its own distinctive traits and abilities, from the evil Oni, to the&amp;#10;funny Tengu, to the prankster Tanuki. But they are not the only enemies the heroes&amp;#10;must face, the world of Yokai hides a multitude of hidden dangers.&amp;#10;Throughout the campaign, the players will follow the plot of a story that will take them&amp;#10;through different scenarios, where they will have to face all kinds of challenges. After&amp;#10;each scenario, win or lose, the plot will continue until the story is complete.&amp;#10;Yokai quest has been designed with simplicity in mind, so that anyone, of any age group&amp;#10;and knowledge, can play yokai quest after just one reading of this rulebook.&amp;#10;But let&amp;rsquo;s not waste anymore time! We know you are itching to start, so let us go right&amp;#10;into the world of Yokai Quest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yokai Quest Strikes Back brings with it the following changes and improvement to the original Yokai Quest!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Major Upgrades:&amp;#10;1.  Major revision to the rulebook and Gameplay. We did not just fix the rulebook, we have now completely revised the game. Yokai Quest Strikes back difficulty level has been designed to be challenging for experienced players while at the same time a Little Heroes mode (Easy mode) has also been created for children and new players.&amp;#10;2. The original Yokai Quest had 16 scenarios. Yokai Quest Strikes Back brings you +20 scenarios in a separate, new +80 pages campaign book!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay Tweaks:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Strategy&amp;#10;    1. Hero movement : Movement is now an action. Heroes no longer have costless movement. Additionally, leaving a square adjacent to a yokai will now cost double. Players will now need to strategically plan their hero movement and placement.&amp;#10;    2. Friendly Fire : Powerful abilities have been tweaked - in general, heroes can no longer unleash a skill without a care in the world : swinging their sword at their allies will cause significant damage! The addition of friendly fire means that hero position, skill choice and energy expenditure decision is now even more strategic!&amp;#10;    3. Players may no longer swap items at any time during their phase. Swapping items from the inventory to the hero board can now only be done during the &amp;quot;take a breather&amp;quot; phase, at the end of a hero turn.&amp;#10;    4. Energy token management : Energy tokens can now be used to recharge a skill. This adds another level of strategy to the energy token management. Do you recharge a skill, or save the energy to unleash another skill?&amp;#10;    5. The concept of Line of Sight has been added to the game&amp;#10;    6. Terrain elements have been properly incorporated into the game. There are more strategic decisions to be made around these elements, such as Shrubs, Magic Barriers, altars and monoliths.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Spawn Rate and Yokai Difficulty level&amp;#10;    1. Yokai Spawn rate has been modified , there is now the normal mode (harder), and an easy mode.&amp;#10;    2. Additionally, each spawn point will now spawn a yokai each turn, unless specified otherwise by the scenario conditions&amp;#10;    3. Yokais attributes, attack and defense stats have been tweaked and modified.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additional changes&amp;#10;    1. Heroes no longer receive treasure tokens for defeating a Yokai, unless specified by scenario conditions. Treasures must be earned!&amp;#10;    2. Skills or Abilities have been completely revamped. Each Hero now begins their adventure with a limited number of skills, and are able to purchase more powerful skills with the victory points (experience) they gained during their adventures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Download the new rules here:&amp;#10;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Swi9sXRXel9ejZ9PeCtpSLnqe9udPNs?usp=sharing&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New campaing on kickstarter, suscribe in:&amp;#10;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zenitminiatures/yokai-quest-strikes-back&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
