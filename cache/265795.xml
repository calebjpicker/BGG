						               													<description>A battle-royale, tile placement, strategical board game with grid movement and resources management mechanics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts with putting villagers on the border and each stepping to the middle tile of the side. Villagers start moving by opening new tiles. They explore new lands and mine or find resources, kill enemies, buy new soldier... But they must be afraid of The Storm. The Storm is behind them, and the safe zone is becoming smaller over time. They must fight for that zone and survive. They can mine resources, help friends, shoot from catapult, be lost in a forest an much more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A bit detailed:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Getting Started&amp;#10;To start a game you need to connect borders and place tiles inside borders. Then choose a color, take 2 soldiers, open the central tile of one of the sides of hexagon and place your soldiers on it. That tile is considered as free space. It cannot harm you or be used in any ways. Place the counter on one of the corners of hexagon, which will be counting point. After finishing the preparation choose the first player by rolling the dice, the queue will be determined clockwise. The goal is to survive and be the last man standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turn&amp;#10;Each of villagers can do one action in each turn. The actions are: moving to neighbor tile, buying another villager, killing enemy villagers. Villager can move only to neighbor tiles (the tile which has common side). He must open the unopened tile after moving on it, if the tile is not closed by the storm. He can also carry the resources with him to the new tile (maximal quantity of each resource is mentioned on villager&amp;rsquo;s section), but resources only of one type.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Villagers&amp;#10;A villager dies after a hit from another. To hit an enemy, villager needs to stand on the neighbor tile of the enemy and move to another neighbor tile of an enemy, which is not an abyss, another enemy. You can only kill one enemy on a tile, if the enemy villager&amp;rsquo;s number is greater than one, you can choose which on must die. Villager dies immediately, when he stands on enemy tile. Player can use only the resources, which are located in it&amp;rsquo;s villager&amp;rsquo;s tile. Player must pay one bread , if his villager&amp;rsquo;s count is more than or equal to 3, otherwise he must sacrifice one of his villagers for each unpaid turn. On one tile can be placed less than 4 villagers. You can buy new villagers by gold. Bought villager is placed on tile, where is the other villager with gold. After death of the villager all his resources stay on the same tile, and everyone can take it. If that tile is not available, the resources go to bank. If player does anything with villager, he cannot cancel it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
