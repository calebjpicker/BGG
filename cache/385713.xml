						               													<description>You are a worker working at a rabbit cat sorting area. Let's do our best today to sort the rabbits and cats.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rabbit has long ears and a short tail, and the cat has short ears and a long tail. Everyone knows it. But this is difficult.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, the lead player plays any one card and declare whether it&amp;rsquo;s a cat or a rabbit.  Afterwards, each following player must player a cat (long tail, short ear) or a rabbit (long ear, short tail) accordingly.  If they cannot play the required animal, they either play a rabbit/cat to lose a trick and hands black chips to other players or play a new species and make a trump in order to win the trick.  The card with highest trump or highest responsibility value wins.  If all player can play a card of the needed animal, bonus points (2 white chips) will be given.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of a round, the single player with the most collected black chips do not score points; otherwise, each white chip scores 1 point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thus, in this game, the player would like to declare an animal that every other player can follow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
