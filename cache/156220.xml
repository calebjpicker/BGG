						               													<description>Kastellet is a game for two, played on a hexagonal board comprised of sixty-one smaller hexagons, five to each side.  The central hex is referred to as the Point, and may not be played upon by either participant.  There is a unique neutral piece called the &amp;ldquo;Roy&amp;rdquo; which is used to mark the Point.  Each player has thirteen pieces in their own color, as follows: five Flag pieces, four Maces, three Lances, and one Bar.  Only one piece may be on a hex at a time; landing on an occupied hex is a capture, and the opponent's piece is removed from the game.  The object of the game is to continually &amp;ldquo;cover&amp;rdquo; the Point by always having at least one piece ready to move onto it.  Should a player lose his pieces covering the Point and not be able to move another piece into covering position on the next turn, he loses the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game begins with the players at opposite ends of the board, with a five hexagon side closest to them.  Their five Flags are placed on those closest five hexes, the player's back line.  Flags only move forward to one adjacent hex, toward the opponent's end of the board.  Should a Flag reach the center hex of the opponent's back line, on the next turn (if it has not since been captured) it can be exchanged for that player's Bar piece, which is held in reserve at the start of the game.  The Bar can be placed anywhere on the board, but will remain there for the rest of the game, unable to be moved or captured by either player.  No further moves are allowed for that turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Maces begin the game two to a side on both ends of the players' Flags, extending around the rim of the board.  Maces may move to any adjacent hex, in any direction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lances begin in the central three hexes of the third row of hexes inward from the players' back lines.  The movement of a Lance is through the points and lines of the adjacent hexes to one of up to six hexes just beyond.  The game's hexes may have three alternating colors so that the color-bound moves of the Lances are obvious.  Because of its position on the board and its style of movement, the central of the three Lances begins the game covering the Roy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
