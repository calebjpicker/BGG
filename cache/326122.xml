						               													<description>World War 2 in your pocket Operation Market Garden  is a two player card game, ideal as a filler before or after your main gaming event. Also great as a travel game to take on holiday or when you're out with friends. It plays in 20-40 minutes for players aged 8+.  It's quick to learn but strategic, learn from your enemy and try to get inside their mind to work out what sequence they will lay their cards down.  Artwork by Adrian Stone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Recreating the largest airborne invasion in history, Operation Market Garden in World War 2.  Use your battle and tactic cards to out smart your opponent, use your equipment wisely, reveal events and monitor your divisions. Can you win enough battles to secure the vital bridges, will you be able to capture and hold all of them in time?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round consists of 7 battles, to win a battle the player must have the highest points score. The player will combine, battle, tactic, equipment and event cards to get to their total score.  Whoever wins the most battles wins the bridge.  The Allied player must win the bridge to proceed to the next bridge a draw is not enough.  Players will take it in turns to be the Allied player to see how many bridges they can capture.  The German player can reduce the effectiveness of the Allied player by altering the Allied Division cards, the Allied player can try and counter this using the Victoria Cross card but these are limited so you must use them wisely.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Events can be positive or negative for both sides.  Players must try and work out what sequence their opponent will lay down their cards.  They must remember what cards have already been used and try and get inside their opponents mind to out think them, what did they do last round, will they do the same thing, which combinations of cards do they favour, when should I use my Victoria Cross card.  There are only 3 equipment and 3 tactic cards for each side so they must be used carefully.  Can you get your opponent to use their most powerful card on your weakest card?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
