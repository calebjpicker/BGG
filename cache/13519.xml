						               													<description>Crusade - This is the next generation of board games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What is it?&amp;#10;Crusade is an exciting 2-player board game that is also a three-dimensional card game. If you or anyone you know likes playing card games or thought provoking board games then this is an absolute must-have. Designed with adults in mind it makes a great present for a wide range of ages and will keep both players intrigued every time they play. A typical game lasts about 15~20 minutes so you'll never get bored, you'll never play the same game twice and it really is never over until the last turn of the card. It has very few rules, but for those who prefer not to read rules at all or to have to explain them to new players, each game comes complete with a short 10 minute/side audio-cassette. Side one gives full instructions and an explanation of how to set up the playing pieces, how they move and why. Side two gives simple strategies enough to take you through your first exciting game. Play it once and you've learned it, but it takes memory, luck and cunning to become a really great player. The unique assembly of the playing area and rigid storage box will allow you to play on a full size board, yet when packed away the game is so compact you can take it, or store it, almost anywhere. It is ideal for use in the home, on boats and in caravans. Games are only available direct from the manufacturer and can be ordered by credit card on the secure Internet site or by Fax, Phone and Post.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crusade had been in development for over 10 years before it was put into production, during that period it was extensively tested and refined, into what we believe is now the most exciting 2-player board game ever. It really is the most addictive game you will ever play, the logo 'never just a game' says it all, we've not met anyone yet who has just played one game and put it back in it's box!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The concept was to create a brand new game that had a timeless theme, a game that could stand the test of time in the same manner as Chess and Checkers (Draughts) this would mean the game could not be linked to any film or television characters as they could only date the game to their own popularity. The game would be designed to be user friendly and instantly familiar, as soon as the first game had been played the contestants should feel as though they have been able to play it all their lives. But in order to keep the players interest, the more times the game would be played the greater the thought would need to go into each move. There should be no complicated rules, the game should flow naturally requiring variations in strategy through a series of constant decisions presented by multiple choices and allow for changes in tactics and objectives as various options and opportunities arose.&amp;#10;The playing arena had to be unique, it was required to be robust but light and of a sufficiently large size to make it have a real presence when in use, yet when dismantled the board needed to be compact and take up as little storage space as possible. The board would also to be designed with the facility of integrating a personalized advertising panel allowing corporate customers to promote their company along side the playing area.&amp;#10;The playing pieces would need to be clearly distinguishable and easy to use as this game would not only be played by adults but also by the young and the elderly.&amp;#10;The traditional problem of explaining rules and strategies to new player would be overcome by including in each game box, in addition to the standard explanation leaflet, an audio-tape of not longer than 10 minutes per side that would explain every aspect of the game and allow instant play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the beginning.&amp;#10;We started by examining existing board games and listed their strengths and weaknesses. Probably the most universally well-known board game is Chess; it's been around for over 2000 years so it's certainly stood the test of time. However, great game though it undoubtedly is, it does have basic weaknesses; it's difficult to learn to play well, and a player needs an opponent who is on the same level in order to produce a good contest, a novice or a grand master will provide little entertainment to an average player. Another major factor is, it's enough to give you a headache trying to think all those moves ahead, we wanted a game where you could laugh and joke while you played, our game had to be fun, serious fun. We wanted certain elements of Chess but without the complexity and the seriousness. We accepted that one of the great strengths of Chess was that it allowed for changes in strategy throughout the game and although the game could get very involved, there were actually very few rules. Once you knew how the pieces moved and their relative values that was enough to get you started. Another great strength was the layout of the playing area, very simple and mathematically perfect.&amp;#10;The next choice was to choose what would be the driving force of the game, what made the pieces move. Many traditional board games use dice to determine the moves, well that again we saw that as a weakness, luck plays a very big part in dice games, meaning there is very little skill involved in relation to chance. We decided that a standard pack of playing cards would determine which playing piece moved in Crusade they would give infinitely more permutations to their order of play than dice, as well as the fact that a pack of playing cards is familiar to everyone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Armed with this basic criteria for a new game we stripped out all the other aspects linked with existing board games that we considered not acceptable so:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Out went the boring type of game that seems to go on for days, but you can tell who's going to win after the first half hour.&amp;#10;Excitement is built in to Crusade, it's a quick, yet thought provoking game. Each game will last on average about 15-20 minutes and you'll need memory, luck and cunning in order to become a great player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Out went the endless pages of rules; so complicated and ambiguous that you spent more time reading them than playing the game and the difficulties of explaining to new players what a game is all about is also resolved.&amp;#10;Crusade has very few rules; it's based more on an understanding of the playing pieces objectives and how they move around the board. Play it once and you've learned it, perhaps the strangest thing is, in no time at all, you'll feel you've played it all your life. To help you learn to play in minutes and to explain the game to new players, each game comes complete with a short audio-cassette. Side 1 explains how to set out the pieces, how they move and why, and how to play the game. Side 2 provides hints on strategies and details a full demonstration game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Out went the old fashioned cardboard playing area with the unsightly crease down the center, that folded away into a weird long flat box, which you couldn't seem to store anywhere.&amp;#10;Crusade has a sturdy four piece high quality molded game-board that twists together in seconds to produce a full size playing arena, yet when dismantled it packs away into a specially designed box that gives maximum protection with compact storage. Approximate dimensions in mm. 316L x 162W x 60D (like a shoe box but about half as deep) with a weight of less than 1 kilogram. This makes Crusade not only a fantastic game to keep at home but also the ideal game for use in boats and caravans, where space is at a premium.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Out went the problem of finding a group of people to play with you.&amp;#10;Crusade has been designed to be a 2-player game, because it's far easier to find one person to play with rather than getting together the 4 or 6 people required for some types of board games. Opponents can also be drawn from a vast age range. We recommend it is suitable from 8 years old to Adult, however many below 8 years old can pick up the idea of the game within minutes, as have the many people in their 80's who now enjoy playing. There's a simple handicapping system that allows an expert to have an interesting and exciting game with a complete novice, but nobody stays a novice for long. Even playing with people who do not speak your language is not a barrier; the game becomes self-explanatory by just watching it being played. You will become familiar with Crusade quite literally within minutes, you can play time and time again but you'll never play the same game twice. Each game is a new challenge and throughout the game, even if at times your position doesn't look strong, you still have a chance of winning right up to the very end. It's totally absorbing and never over until the last card is played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
