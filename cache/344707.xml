						               													<description>Czech board game about road traffic. The game was to teach children the rules of the road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has their own car on the game board - dice and tokens (money) are used to play, which are used to pay fines for violating the rules of the road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Interesting fact: &amp;#10;The official rules of the game also provide a basic overview of road traffic signs.&amp;#10;The preface to the rules was written by the Ministry of Emergency Security&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Basic course of the game:&amp;#10;It is played on a game board that shows the road (which has a clearly defined start and finish) and each player has his own figure (in the shape of a race car), which moves around the playing area. To move around the board, players roll the dice (three dice with numbers 1 to 6). At the beginning of the game, players roll the dice - the player with the highest total starts and then the others according to the sum on the dice.&amp;#10;Subsequently, the players take turns - everyone rolls the dice on their turn - and according to the sum on the dice, they move on the playing field towards the goal with the toy car.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board shows the roads, including traffic signs - for example:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Main road in front of the intersection - the player can continue without interruption&amp;#10;     Side road in front of the intersection - you are on a side road and you have to pass all the vehicles on the main road - so deduct 2 points from your roll of the dice for the delay at the intersection.&amp;#10;     Prohibition of overtaking - in corners or marked places, players may not overtake the vehicles of other players in front of them - they must follow them, even if they threw a larger number of points on the dice. It is possible to overtake only after the end of the overtaking ban.&amp;#10;     Traffic light - the game contains a dice that has colors on the sides - red, yellow and green. When a player arrives at the intersection square with a traffic light, he must roll this dice and may not continue until he is green.&amp;#10;     Speed &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#139;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#139;limit - a player who moves in this part of the road counts only half the value of his dice roll.&amp;#10;     No stop sign - if a player ends his turn on this square, he must pay one coin fine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game also contains red wooden chips that represent money. At the beginning of the game, the players distribute them evenly. When playing, the places where fines are paid are defined - for example, No stop sign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner is the player who reaches the finish line first and at the same time has at least one more money - so he did not spend everything on fines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
