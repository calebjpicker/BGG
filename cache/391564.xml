						               													<description>Players compete to place their figurines on a precarious tower based on dice rolls. The game requires dexterity, strategy, and a bit of luck. The player who successfully places all their figurines without causing the tower to collapse wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: Players take turns rolling a die and placing their figurines on the corresponding colored levels of the tower. If the tower wobbles and figurines fall off during a player's turn, that player is responsible for picking them up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal: The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their figurines. Players strategically choose where to place their figurines on the tower, aiming to create a stable structure while also trying to make it more challenging for the next player. Rolling the die determines which level to place a figurine or perform other actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
