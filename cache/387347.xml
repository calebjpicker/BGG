						               													<description>From the creators of the hit game WordARound comes a magical twist for Disney lovers!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In WordAround, players try to discover and read words written in a circle on round cards before their opponents. The player who guesses it correctly gets the card as a point. The first player to collect 10 cards or the player who has more cards at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Disney WordARound is perfect for both fans of WordARound and new players to the game who can enjoy hours of playing with friends and family.  As fast as you can, read the Disney word in the circle and shout it out.  It may not be as easy as you think! Each game card has a fan-favorite character on the back.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes 100 cards with 300 Disney-related words.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
