						               													<description>These rules are for use with very large scale fleet actions. They give the possibility of refighting an action as large as the battle of Jutland in just a few hours. &amp;#10;They include full information to fight with the ships that existed at the time in the squadrons they were actually in. &amp;#10;Counter sets for each squadron are available by email once you have bought the rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What if Jutland had been refought in 1918 as the German High Command wanted to. &amp;#10;By this time both fleets were vastly different to those that fought at Jutland in 1916. &amp;#10;The British had 12 major warships with 15&amp;rdquo; guns and the Germans had their own 15&amp;rdquo; gunned dreadnoughts available. The British also had two whole units of aircraft carriers with torpedo dropping planes. The Germans had shore based aircraft and Zeppelins. &amp;#10;Rules include all ships in the Grand fleet and the High Seas Fleet as they were in 1918 as well as aircraft, submarines and aircraft carriers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A PDF file of ship counters is also available by email from the publisher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
