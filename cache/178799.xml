						               													<description>The merciless battle between Powers of Light and Darkness started in the old times. Powers of darkness retreated, but it was just a temporary respite.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Be prepared for the full battle with the Manticore! Investigate the forest and construct roads to the magical armor and amulets. Monsters &amp;ndash; servants of darkness &amp;ndash; will hinder you. Time is limited: as soon as magical fetters are off, the monster will start his fire path to the Castle in order to become the Absolute Lord of the Forest. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste a minute: find the artifacts that are the only chance for a victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two variants of the game: team-play against the Manticore (against the system) where the team either together wins or loose; and individual game face-to-face with the Monster.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The legend returns!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ESSENCE OF THE GAME:&amp;#10;   &amp;#10;Players begin their journey in the Forest world of the City which is soon to undergo an invasion of the awakened Manticore. At first the players should find their way into the abandoned workshops and places of power around the City &amp;ndash; where they will be able to acquire weapons and artifacts that enhance certain characteristics of the hero. Pathfinding is carried out with laying on the board of tiles depicting the road. Each of the players paves the way for their own, but can also use the road paved by other players. Some tiles contain a monster - if a player has laid out such tile, then a monster token is placed. Player may try to circumvent a monster, but may also fight him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all the tiles are exhausted, the Manticore awakens and begins moving in the direction of the City. If the Manticore reaches the City - all the players loose the game, so the task of the Players is to defeat the Manticore before her arrival in the City.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;Battle with monsters and with the Manticore is made with a die roll. However, in addition, there are also random battle cards that determine what type of attack (magic, melee, shooting) is used in this round of the fight (see &amp;lsquo;Conducting a fight&amp;rsquo;). Card is opened blindly, and can bring a pleasant surprise (attack with the most developed hero&amp;rsquo;s skill) or not pleasant. This encourages players to improve different abilities of their heroes.&amp;#10;AWARDS&amp;#10;Winner of the &amp;quot;Baby Expo Ukraine 2018&amp;quot; (best strategy game)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
