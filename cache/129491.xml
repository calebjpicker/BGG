You will have to be creative and smart in handling your budget, cash flow, and strategy in order to turn your original capital into the profits you need to move ahead in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Action Cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just as in life, each player starts the game with their own unique set of Action Cards. Essentially, these are your gifts, talents and special abilities in the game. It's up to you to use them in the best way possible, and they can be played during any turn. So, be creative and you will make money and friends The Stock Market, Loans, &amp;amp; Partnerships As you go through the game, there will be many business dimensions that you can leverage to help you win, such as the Stock Market, Loans, Partnerships and more...&amp;#10;The more dimensions you master the better results you will get and the more fun you will have...in FreshBiz and in life!
