						               													<description>Runestar is a D12 mass-fantasy system, designed for use with 28mm miniatures. It has a dynamic turn sequence to create a sense of simultaneous combat and balanced play rewards strategy over luck. Players choose their own armies from one of twelve army lists; fielding hosts of infantry, archers, cavalry and skirmishers, supported by war-beasts, artillery, air cavalry and superheavies, led by their heroes and mages. With over two hundred unique unit types the variety is endless.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All units in Runestar are made using a mathematical formula, so all army lists start from a level-playing field. However, there is plenty of style to go with the substance, and players can expect characterful special rules and random crazy stuff too. Its not quite as balanced as chess, but then it isn't designed to be!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of each game of Runestar varies - from headhunting missions to slay enemy heroes to all out clashes of force; from small elite forces ambushing vast hordes to take and hold scenarios; from epochal sieges with giant hosts to subtle skirmishes of ten or twenty warriors in places deep and dark.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can set their battles on the nodeworld Goragaia or in extra-planar realms, where the laws of Nature hold less sway. With five Era's worth of fantastical history, players can re-fight legendary battles in the Runestar canon or forge the future in the fires of war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The one-roll combat system (attacker strength + defender weakness = to-hit roll) ensures that games play swiftly, and the mighty D12 allows for plenty of variation between units whilst keeping things slick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Rune-magick system is unique. Mages combine rune cards to form spells, stacking the abilities of different runes on top of each other to create their own chants. Players must use their own initiative to cast magick effectively, and the creative possibilities are boundless.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magick items are extremely rare, and most champions must rely on runic blades which need to be charged by mages to have any special effects. Mages also have access to Arcanes - runic staves and talismans which cast special spells when they are charged with certain runes, providing more of a tactical advantage than one of brute might.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Runestar is set on the nodeworld Goragaia in its Fifth Era and is as much a saga as it is a game. Forces metaphysical clash against each other in a world steeped in ancient history, echoes of dead gods, runic-magick and the mystery of the Runestar itself. Caught between a titanic federation of human realms, the Sivan Alliance, and the Undying Legions of psychotic monarchs, the Symbol Kings, the factions of Goragaia know that only one force will remain standing by the end of the Fifth Era...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
