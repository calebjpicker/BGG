						               													<description>Hegemony of Faith is a card and party game for 4-8 players, every player's main purpose in the game is to find a way to collect the most believer cards and become the leader of the largest faith group.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The biggest game feature in Hegemony of Faith is that: every player never worries about death or being eliminated from the game. This game has a surrender and temporary cooperation mechanism. When a player does not have any believer card in his turn, he will find another player to surrender and swear allegiance (Of course not true allegiance), become a follower in a group, and cooperate against another player. However, the follower players can still secretly recruit their own forces in order to seek a comeback.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;According to the surrendering mechanism above, it also has a betrayal mechanism. After becoming a follower, players can use specific skills or action cards to betray and take away the believer cards of the group leader. In addition, of course, there are also special cards, that allow players to prevent betrayal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, players will experience what it feels like a faith leader. You have to consider how to use the cards and the strategy to get the most benefit. You also may become another's follower and conspiracy to betray. No matter what you do, you have to find a way to become the most powerful faith party leader to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
