						               													<description>Taumant's Lair is a dice game for a single player with a duration of approximately 20 minutes. To play you need six six-sided dice, each not exceeding 0.5 inches, about eight pawns, and a dozen counters or tokens. If you do not have any pawns nor counters.&amp;#10;The game is divided into three different parts, each corresponding to three pages, which you will use as game boards. Print each one on a different sheet of cardboard and follow their instructions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part I: Recruiting Adventurers&amp;#10;The first step to penetrate Taumant's lair is to form a party capable of surviving its many hazards. Luckily, you are near to the city-state of Kalazar, located between two kingdoms at war. It makes Kalazar the perfect place to look for adventurers. You must explore the city and try to recruit people prepared to risk their lives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part II: The Dungeon&amp;#10;It's the time! Your party is about to get into the cavern. Your goal is to get through its six levels with as few losses as possible. You will play six turns, each corresponding one level of the cave. Put the pawns representing your adventurers on the appropriate square of the column 'ready' and another one on the first level of the dungeon. If you beat the sixth level, you will face Taumant in Part III with your surviving adventurers!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part III: Taumant!&amp;#10;You have arrived at Taumant's chamber. This will be a tough fight! As soon as he meets the adventurers, he prepares himself to reduce his enemies to ashes with his deadly fire breath. You have only three turns before he buries your party in a hell of flames. Every unwounded adventurer has a roll for every turn. Put this sheet 12 inches from you and roll a die towards the dragon; if it stops on him, you will cause damage points depending on its location. If you cause 50 or more damage points, you win! Otherwise, you can return to Part I and try again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
