						               													<description>The Mechanic is a very compact card game for 2-6 players (4+ ages), you can learn how to play it in less than 3 minutes. In the box you can find 84 cards: 12 special engine cards, 66 gear combinations cards and 6 mechanic character cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The mechanics of the game is similar to Mexican Train. Each card has a combination of two gears, one on each end. Each player builds their own mechanism by matching and connecting the gears by type and color. The goal is to be the first player to play all of their gears.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special engine cards are used to begin the game, but also to split the sequence into two, so players will have the opportunity to play on more than one side of the mechanism, giving them more options to get rid of all their cards. Gears can be arranged in several ways to build different mechanisms&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
