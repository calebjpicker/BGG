						               													<description>From the back of the box:&amp;#10;Contents: 4 boards with perforations, 126 banknotes, 10 fixed cards, 4 insurance policies, 80 random cards, 80 pegs, 1 die.&amp;#10;The purpose of the game is to trade goods in such a way that you can keep your business going, avoid bankruptcy, if possible make a profit and become the foremost firm on the market. Each player has a business, in other words a board with columns for 6 kinds of goods, and a starting capital of $100,000. Each player buys one kind of goods. There are 6 different kinds of goods with various prices. Before a player can buy one kind of goods he must throw a certain number on the dice. When he does so, he can go ahead and buy a maximum of three units of the chosen kind of goods. If the player throws a smaller number, he must then take a card from the pack of random cards and follow the instructions. These can be helpful or unhelpful. Once a player has several kinds of goods he can start selling and by doing so try to make a profit. However, he can sell only goods of one kind each time, and only - as with buying - when he throws the right number on the dice. Once he has thrown this number the bank gives him  the specified selling price which contains a certain profit margin. If the player throws a smaller number, he may not sell and must draw a random card whose instructions he must follow.&amp;#10;What makes the game exciting is that all the players have the chance to bid for goods being bought or sold. In other words, when goods are being bought each player can make his own bid and acquire the goods. The same applies to selling. The specified selling price can be undercut, giving the player an opportunity to find a buyer for his goods. But remember: the purpose is still to make a profit in the end.&amp;#10;The winner is the player who reaches the topmost square with his goods. The other players then count up their capital (goods and money) and work out their relative positions on the market.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
