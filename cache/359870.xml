Designed by a manga artist and published by a manga publisher, the game is sold in their stores and has a manga produced with it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck has cards numbered from 0 to 9, and each card has a special action on it. Each player chooses two cards and hides them from the other player, standing them up in small standees. The players must deduce which cards are hidden.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players start with two hit points. Each time a player makes a correct deduction, and accurately identifies a hidden card (an attack), the hiding player loses a hit point. When a player gets to zero, or starts their turn with no hand cards, they lose the game. But players can recover points when playing cards during the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has a hand of the remaining cards, and take turns playing a hand card and then making a guess. The hand card played has a special demand, such as, 'is this card a 5 or higher?', or 'which card has the higher value?'. Other cards have actions such as, return a played card to your hand, and, your opponent may not attack this turn.  As cards are played out to the table, it becomes more obvious what cards are hidden.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, when a hidden card is revealed, it goes back to the player's hand and they may place another card hidden.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By logical deduction, a player should be able to work out which cards are hidden and eliminate their opponent.&amp;#10;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
