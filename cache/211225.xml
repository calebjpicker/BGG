						               													<description>A new tactical Wargame in which players will experience the hardships of modern combat like never before. Unlike the wars of the past the War on Terror has been against an enemy that is all but unseen, he wears no standard uniform and doesn't comply with the rules of war. Tactical Firefight has captured the essence of the nature of combat during these turbulent times. In the game one player will play Coalition Forces while the other player will be playing the insurgent forces. Contained in the first installment of the Tactical Firefight Series are missions from Operation Enduring Freedom(OEF). The US lead invasion of Afghanistan in 2001-present. Gameplay will involve a scenario deck in which the Coalition player draws a card from his/her scenario deck. Reveals this to his/her opponent and set up the game likewise for that scenario. As well as these scenario cards. Once the mission is set up each player will then draw a card from their respective objective decks. For the insurgent player this objective is secondary to stopping the Coalition player from achieving the mission goal. So for the Coalition player this objective is secondary to the overall mission. If these objectives are completed during the game however will affect the amount of victory points at the end of the mission. Tactical Firefight will also be able to be played solo with just as much depth as when playing against an opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
