						               													<description>Cubano is a territory placement game, using cubic dice and wooden sticks. This nice and clever material can also be used to play several other games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the main game, &amp;quot;Cubano 2 dice&amp;quot;, each player has a color and tries to form the biggest set of connected dice of his own color through three phases. At the beginning of the game, all the cubes and sticks are put in a common reserve.&amp;#10;During the first phase, each player rolls two dice and take from the reserve sticks and cubes according to the dice rolled (own color = 1 cube, other colors = 4 sticks).&amp;#10;During the second phase, which starts when there is no stick left in the reserve, players can collect cubes, place cubes and sticks on the board (a cube must be surrounded by sticks) and also steal cubes and sticks from other players stocks.&amp;#10;During the third phase, which starts when the reserve is empty, players tries to place their remaining sticks and cubes, and can also turn cubes already placed on the board on their own color. The game ends when the last cube is placed, and the player with the most connected cubes wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
