						               													<description>It will take strengthyness, craftyness and magickyness to be Gameshop Adventurers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a D&amp;amp;D style adventure game for 1 or 2 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Needed to play: the deck of 6 cards, 1d20 and 4 eurocubes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players work together as a Party of Adventurers to survive their journey and defeat what awaits them in the final room. Each player chooses one Player Card and then which side they wish to use, placing cubes to mark their initial XP and HP.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player begins with 2 skills, listed next to their initial XP: STR (Strengthyness) and CRF (Craftyness). All players have a starting STR equal to a D4 and a CRF which will differ depending on which card they chose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For both STR and CRF, the die rolls will be as stated until you reach a new XP level where they will increase (ex. The Warrior begins with a STR:D4, when he reaches 2 XP this then changes to STR:D5)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Sorceress and Wizard can also cast magic spells (their Magickyness). There are two types of spells: those in blue can be cast at any time during an Attack; those in red can be cast during an Attack but the player may not use their STR to help (see Attack below) in the Party Attack number. Only one spell may be cast in an Attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player also begins the game with a Special Skill or Starting Spell which is listed at the bottom of the Player Card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attack: Most rooms have a foe in them to be overcome. Attacking is mandatory unless the Wizard uses his Enchantment Spell (in this case the party moves to the next room and there is no attack but the party receives +1XP for being sneaky).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player will roll for their STR value separately and both values are then added together. This is the Party Attack number. One player then rolls for the STR of the foe (as listed in the current room). This is the Foe Attack number. If the Party Attack number is equal to or higher than the Foe Attack number, the players win the attack, slay the foe and proceed to the next room, with each player gaining the Success Bonus as listed. If the Party Attack value is lower, each player takes the amount of HP damage as listed and they then proceed to the next room.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Order of Play: The players will proceed from room to room, in numerical order, until they reach the final room where they will be successful and live to fight another day, thereby winning the game, or they will be soundly and  utterly defeated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the 4th in a series of Annual Games Unlimited Holiday Games and is the followup to Gameshop Express (2011), Gameshop Workday (2012) and Gameshop Gladiators (2013)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
