						               													<description>Played this is a child, so the game's objective is not remembered. It came with a fold out board a la Twister, though not as large. There were numbered/colored Glunk cards that were placed around the board in designated outlined locations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I only remember it being one of those frenetic games, as players raced to grab certain types of cards using the included one foot+ long wands with a suction cup at the end. Many times the suction wasn't strong enough and frustrated players with smash the wand down on the card numerous times until it would adhere. It was a noisy, chaotic affair, and the gimmick wore off quite fast. Made good for some temporary hysterics though..&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;            &amp;#10;        &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Played this is a child, so the game's objective is not remembered.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Response: This was kind of a Demolition Derby type of Go Fish. There were two sets of cards. Player Cards and Glunk Cards. The Glunk cards were shuffled and placed face down in the middle of a 4' by 4' heavy vinyl sheet. The Player cards were scattered face down around the Glunk cards. Each player would take turns counting 3-2-1 and tuning up a Glunk card and calling the colour of the Glunk pictured. The card would be placed face up on top of the deck.The person turning the card would have to quickly get out of the way as blows would begin raining down as players would try to stick their suction cup tipped Glunk stick to the back of each card in rapid succession, looking for a colour match. No hands allowed, except to replace the non-matching cards face down on the sheet. When a match was found the player would call it, keep the card and claim the Glunk card to form a pair. The winner was the player with the most pairs at the end of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Note:*My brother's solution to cards not sticking well, was to LICK the suction cup in between cards. I ended up with many bruises resulting from being bashed while playing. The force of the blows was quite something, seeing as the sticks were made of thick, rigid plastic. Within two years all were broken and the vinyl sheet - white when turned over, became my thrifty mother's picnic table cloth.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
