						               													<description>Tower Capture combines the strategy of checkers and chess with the luck involved in a quick roll of the dice. The idea of Tower Capture is to simply capture the tower of your opponent by moving across the board of white and black hexagons. However, the movement of your 10 pieces is partially controlled by the two dice, which determine whether you move to a white or a black space, and whether you move through a red, yellow, or blue path. To win, make it to the space adjacent to the opposing tower, and capture opponent's pieces along the way by landing on the same space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
