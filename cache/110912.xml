						               													<description>A two player card game, in the similar style to Lost Cities, but different. It currently has no theme, and can as of now be played with two standard playing card decks, shuffled together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game involves the player in solitaire style card moving, card organization, thoughtful hand management, constant card battling with opponent, and fast quick turns, with drawing, recycling old cards, and discarding useless ones.  The game is designed to be very completive, use risk management, be tactically complex in options, and played through multiple rounds, with some games yielding multiple game points, so the far behind loser has a reason to fight with a bad hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players involve themselves in gameplay in which they draw cards during their turn, maintaining hand sizes of 10, and play those cards down on differing piles, to accumulate points, matching the suits.  However, the opposing player is constantly battling for victory as well, with his piles point totals.  Players also discard and recycle cards onto the various piles.  Many cards have special attributes which mix up the play.  First player to reach an objective of 5 game points, (added from various round points), is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
