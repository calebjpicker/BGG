						               													<description>[Adapted from the box back and instruction sheet.]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here is a magnificent mound of fun games that you can play, all of which will help children develop their spelling skills. This pack consists of instructions, and 100 small (42 x 62 mm) cards with letters, letter values, and illustrations by Tony Ross from David Walliams's book Awful Auntie. Also included is a list of words that are drawn from the [British] government's notes for Key Stage 1 and 2 spellings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Games include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CROSSWORD: Players take turns playing letters from their hand and a draw pile onto a growing crossword on the table, scoring the sum of the letters' values in the new word. When the deck runs out, the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WORD CHASE: Players each choose a 7-letter word from the word booklet, and then take turns in rummy-like play until they have the letters for their word in their hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WORD GRAB: All 100 letters are face down. Players take turns turning up one letter.  When someone sees a word that can be spelled, they call it out, collect the letters, and spell the word in front of them. You can also claim others' words by calling an anagram of their word, or by making a new word by adding new letters. When the cards are all face up, the player with the most letters wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GRID LOCK: 16 cards are placed in a 4x4 grid, and players write as many words as they can spell from those letters. In GRID LOCK II it's the same but with the requirement that letters be in an adjacent chain like Boggle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SPELLBOUND: Four letters are placed on the table. In a turn a player places a letter on one of the four columns, at the top or bottom, and says a word that includes the letters in that column in that order. The first to empty their hand wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
