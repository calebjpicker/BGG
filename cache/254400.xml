						               													<description>Archers, chariots, javelin throwers, infantry, initiative, and the Mount of Megiddo itself all play their part. This is a two player non-card driven war game. The Egyptians have to get 1/3rd of their forces, within a time limit, off the opposite map board edge. The Judeans either have to delay them, or inflict sufficient losses on them. Historically, the Egyptian forces were on their way to help their allies the Assyrians against the Babylonians. To do so, they had to pass through Judean territory. We do not know why Josiah went to war against Egypt. The Assyrian capital, Ninevah, had already fallen to the Babylonians and Medes in 612 (read Nahum). The remaining Assyrian forces had regrouped at Haran, but in 609 they were forced west of the Euphrates. It appears to be at this time that the Egyptians under Necho II were coming to the Assyrian&amp;rsquo; aid. King Josiah marched out to meet them in battle. Perhaps Josiah opposed the passage of Necho&amp;rsquo;s forces through the pass at Megiddo (See 2 Chron.35:20-24) because he feared that the growth of either Egyptian or Assyrian power would have adverse results for the continued independence of Judah. (TKB 2 Kings 23:29). Pharaoh Necho II sent word to Josiah that God had told him to immediately attack Babylon &amp;ldquo;so stop opposing God who is with me, or He will destroy you.&amp;rdquo; (35:21) Yet, Josiah refused to accept the word of the Lord from Pharaoh Necho II and went to fight against him on the plain of Megiddo. &amp;ldquo;Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Pharaoh Necho II has said at God&amp;rsquo;s command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.&amp;rdquo; (35:22) Josiah was wounded by an archer in battle and died in Jerusalem and was buried in the tombs of his fathers (35:23-24). There was great mourning in Judea and Jerusalem. This is 2nd Megiddo, King Josiah vs Pharaoh Necho II. Can you change history?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
