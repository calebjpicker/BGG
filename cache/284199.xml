						               													<description>Two legendary cyborgs from AvP Arcade Game are now available. Compatible with with AvP board game and Unleashed wargame expansion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dutch Schaeffer is a no-nonsense Major in the USCM and an experimental &amp;lsquo;half-synthetic&amp;rsquo; cyborg developed by Weyland-Yutani Corporation after his arm was torn off in an off-world colonial resistance against a xenomorph hive. The only other known example of a cyborg in the USCM is Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa, who Dutch famously teamed up with after their supporting USCM squads were all but wiped out during a Xenomorph invasion of San Drad, California on Earth. Interestingly, Dutch and Linn also temporarily allied themselves with two yautja during that incursion, but that has since become highly classified and sensitive information, of which both Dutch and Linn have been programmed to forget about due to many suggestive rumours about Weyland-Yutani Corporation involvement. Schaeffer is a heavy-set Olympian of a man, enhanced by bionics throughout his body and carries an impossible to ignore cybernetic arm which he uses to smash his foes into the ground, grapple them, throw them or simply blast them to pieces with the M56 Smartgun mounted within it. Without the physique Schaeffer has maintained for himself, using this device would be practically impossible for any human to utilize.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Linn Kurosawa is a petite, cyborg soldier, but her size is no means indicative of her combat prowess. Where her counterpart Dutch is a wall of muscle and machine, Linn is a whirlwind of destruction armed with a pair of M7 heavy autopistols and a katana that has been honed to a mono-molecular edge, and able to cut through nearly any armour. Linn&amp;rsquo;s armaments don&amp;rsquo;t end there though, as she has an over-flowing arsenal of martial arts techniques which she applies in all kinds of combinations to deal a crushing, but utterly puzzling, blow to her&amp;#10;adversaries. Since the xenomorph infestation incident of San Drad, Linn has continued to command the 13th USCM company and has seen far more off-world combat than Schaeffer, often in unexpected locations. To this day, Dutch and Linn team up in a variety of combat zones against all manner of foe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
