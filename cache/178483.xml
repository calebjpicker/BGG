						               													<description>Card Game&amp;#10;Object of the game: To get as many high scoring pairs as possible.&amp;#10;The winner: is the one with the highest score. This is determined by adding up the numbers on the right hand corner of each pair of mates.&amp;#10; Dealer gives each player seven cards and puts the rest of the pack in the middle, turning over the first card. Each player looks to see if he has any mates. This can be seen by matching the number at the top right hand corner. A pair must be one male and one female, not two males or females. If he has any pairs, he places them face up in front of him, so that everyone can see.&amp;#10;Each turn, the player must have a minimum of five cards in his hand before he starts. If his hand has become depleted because he won some pairs on his previous turn, then he must take as many cards as he needs from the middle pile to bring his hand up to five. He can take the last card thrown down by the last player as one of these cards if he wishes. If he has a pair (or pairs), he puts them in front as before so that everyone can see. At the end of his turn, he throws down one card on the upturned pile.&amp;#10;Tracey Trouble card can be acted upon when the player wishes to steal unprotected pairs ie: if one is picked from the pile, he may act upon it immediately or keep it until it is of more use.&amp;#10;Johnny Condom cards can be used whenever a player wants to protect his pairs whether he picks one up or is dealt one. To protect a pair he must place a Johnny Condom card on top of that pair.&amp;#10;Right Brian Bummer cards are good for nothing and are there as a joker card - mainly to hold up the game.&amp;#10;5When all the pairs are out and the only cards still circulating are Tracey&amp;rsquo;s, Johnny&amp;rsquo;s or Right Brian&amp;rsquo;s, then each player adds up his score and the player with the highest number is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Amusing Note: According to the back of the box there are cards called 'Right Brain Bummer', i.e. no good, but in the components they have changed to 'Right Brian Bummer'. Someone didn't do their spell-checking very well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
