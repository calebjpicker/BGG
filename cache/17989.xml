						               													<description>DISCOVERY OF INDIA, is a, presumably Indian, educational boardgame based for 2 to 4 players Ages 8 and up.  It is published in English.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players move their playing pieces around the board which is a pictorial representation of the country of India.  The country is divided into 25 states, each further divided into a number of territories. Pieces are able to move move from territory to any adjacent territory, whether belonging to the same state or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as a player visits a state for the first time he/she collects a token card for that state - the ultimate aim of the game being to visit all 25 states.  There is no requirement to go to more than one territory in each state though the geography of the board (and the country for that matter) will require players to pass through a large number of territories in order to visit all 25 states.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each state has a set of quiz cards associated with it.  When a player moves into a new territory he/she is asked a question pertaining to the state in which the territory is located.  If the question is answered correctly the territory is &amp;quot;conquered&amp;quot; and a marker placed on the board to denote which player &amp;quot;owns&amp;quot; that territory.  Ownership of a territory means that other players that wish to pass through it must successfully answer a quiz card question in order to progress further.  This forces players to plan their routes carefully in order to work their way around territories owned by the other players, or gamble on whether they might know the answer to a question they may be asked.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player that is the first to visit all 25 states, thereby collecting 25 token cards, is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
