						               													<description>This is a set of eight scenarios for Advanced Squad Leader. The scenarios all include German units from the 1st SS Panzerdivision Leibstandarte Division Normandie&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These scenarios tend to be a mix of medium and large numbers of troops. Here is a summary of each scenario as provided by Lone Canuck Publishing:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     LSSAH 41 - Mouen, France, 28 June 1944: British spearheads of the 15th Scottish Division have advanced south, seizing bridges over the Orne River.

The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte is rushed into a blocking position unseen by Allied observers and waits in ambush, directly in the path of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment.Map Boards: 2, Overlays: 3, Turns: 7&amp;#10;     LSSAH 43 - Solders, France, 18 July 1944: Despite heavy losses, Operation GOODWOOD continued to grind its way forward, the battlefield littered with burning hulls of the British 11th Armoured Division. Shortly after midday, the 2/Fife and Forfar Yeomanry is ordered to capture the Bourg&amp;eacute;bus Ridge; simultaneously, the 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte is ordered to counterattack. Map Boards: 3, Overlays: 1, Turns: 7&amp;frac12;&amp;#10;     LSSAH 44 - Tilly-la-Campagne, France, 25 July 1944: The Americans had launched Operation COBRA, at the same the Canadians had launched Operation SPRING; its objective to capture Point 122. On route the Canadians had to first clear Tilly-la-Campagne, where hidden among the smoulder ruins were the Pioniers, Panzergrenadiers, and Panzers the 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte. Map Boards: 2, Turns: 7&amp;#10;     LSSAH 45 - Saint Barthelemy, France, 7 August 1944: The Germans launched Operation L&amp;Uuml;TTICH, its objective to recapture Avranches and cut-off Patton's 3rd Army spilling into Brittiany. In the foggy morning hours, 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte drove into Saint Barthelemy fully expecting the village to be cleared earlier by 2.Panzerdivision; but as the fog lifted, the lead elements found themselves fighting in close quarters with GIs of the 117th Infantry Regiment. Map Boards: 4, Overlays: 1, Turns: 7&amp;frac12; &amp;#10;     LSSAH 46 - Saint Barthelemy, France, 9 August 1944: The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte attack ground to a halt.

The 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte received orders to hold open the narrowing corridor to allow the what was left of the 7th Army to withdraw out of the collapsing pocket. Map Boards: 4, Turns: 7&amp;frac12;&amp;#10;     LSSAH 48 - Saint-Lambert, France, 20 August 1944: The Allies' noose was tightening about the neck of the Falaise Pocket.
