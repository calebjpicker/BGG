						               													<description>Mythos of Legends is a tabletop wargame of grand strategy involving gods, mythical beasts, legendary heroes and mortal soldiers. Players choose their faction from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Dark Age Pagans, Ancient Egypt and Eldritch Abominations. Each faction has a unique roster and playstyle, further affected by the player's choice of deity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Mythos Board is the domain of the gods. Each player has one 35mm scale deity model which affects the rolls that they need to make on the battlefield. By way of example, soldiers that follow Ares will fight more effectively in combat than those who follow Hades, but Hades' followers are much tougher to kill. Each deity also has unique abilities called Divine Interventions, such as Osiris resurrecting friendly models or Loki stealing the enemy's dice,  meaning that overall the player's choice of deity has a massive effect on how their army performs. The gods are locked in their own struggle of wills and moods as they move around the Mythos Board. Their position grants further bonuses to their followers depending on what stats the player thinks are most important at the current moment in time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The soldiers, beasts and heroes fight on the battlefield in the name of their deity. Legendary Units such as the Lernean Hydra, Julius Caesar and Ragnar Lothbrok are represented by 15mm scale miniautres, while ordinary soldiers are sculpted in 10mm on ranked bases. Players secretly assign their units order tokens and then activate them alternately, carrying out the order. Success or failure comes from dice rolls based on four stats - Wrath, Wisdom, Swiftness and Determination - with the number of dice to be rolled based on the unit's profile, equipment and the position of the patron deity on the Mythos Board. The deity's stats determine the roll for a success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The turn structure is set up so that players roll off for priority, move their deities and attempt divine interventions, secretly assign orders to their units, carry out their orders alternately and then finally take break checks and check for victory conditions as determined by the scenario.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
