						               													<description>Theme: Willy Slowman was probably the best intergalactic merchant ever to tackle the business.  He started out with a hundred credits to his name and the keys to a small cargo hauler.  Over the years he forged intergalactic trade routes, stared down pirates and amassed a small fortune.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When Willy died he left behind a sizeable fortune and a single stipulation in his will, that one of his relatives would prove to be the rightful heir to his shipping empire by following in his footsteps.  Relatives started pouring out of the woodwork trying for a chance to win Willy's fortune.  You know nothing about trade routes, or pirates, or the galaxy at large... but this is a chance of a lifetime.  As one of Willy's recognized relatives (fourth cousin of a nephew, twice removed) the lawyers for the Slowman estate are going to provide you with 100 credits and a small cargo hauler, if you can be the first to amass 1000 credits you will prove yourself to be the rightful heir.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: In this game the players race around the board to pick-up and deliver chits to amass their fortunes.  The board is modular in order to increase replayability, and the chits are not sorted to decrease the set-up time (chits only have to be added/removed when changing the starting worlds - not the board layout).  Chits include Events which have a timed effect, Goods, Passengers, Enemies which can harass the players or be hunted for bounty, Mined Goods and Ship Upgrades (increase your combat effectiveness or speed).  This allows for a variety of gameplay strategies.  The rules have been streamlined and every effort has been made to make it as streamlined and simple as possible without losing any of the flavor or depth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But in the end the game is all about making money, and the first player to 1000 credits is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
