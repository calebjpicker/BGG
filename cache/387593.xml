						               													<description>This is an unusual game from Parker Brothers that involved a detailed map of the United States as the game board, lined with letters of the alphabet that were used to make radio call signs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is supposed to begin in the players' home city, at their local station, and a spinner is used to contact other stations. That sounds like a normal race game, and apparently the player who achieves the greatest combined distance wins. However, the game also involves &amp;quot;special pins&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;measuring device&amp;quot; which are not obvious at all. Multiple copies of the game board have been found with pinholes across their surface.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game appears as &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; in the 1927 Parker Games catalog, but it has disappeared by 1929.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
