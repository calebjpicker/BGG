						               													<description>In the traditional, diagonal form of Checkers, pieces are restricted to playing on a single color of the checkerboard. Thus it is possible to play two games simultaneously on the same board. The first game is played on the Dark squares, and the second game on the Light squares.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also, the conventional way of playing two games simultaneously is that the player makes a move in the first game, then another move in the second game. However, in 'Persephone' the player picks between either of the two games in which he wants to move a piece. Captures still take precedence over any other move. So a player is forced to make a capture on a particular side of the board if possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player wins when he manages to capture all of his opponents pieces that are on the same color of the checkerboard - either all the Light pieces or all the Dark pieces. With two games at once, the chances of a draw are greatly reduced. If one of the games is undecided, the other game can still be resolved for the win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The two sides are Iron and Gold. Instead of pieces being referred to as Men and Kings, they are known as Maidens and Queens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other than this, the game follows the rules of Spanish Checkers. This is played very much like Anglo-American Checkers, the main difference is that the Queen has a more substantial move along any number of vacant squares, including ones beyond a captured piece. Captures are mandatory. If a player has a choice of captures he must take the greater number of pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
