						               													<description>Cinelinx is a fast paced card game of connecting movies, actors, genres and more together to form cohesive links between them. With a dynamic play area based on every card played, the game constantly adapts itself to film fans of any level of skill or knowledge. Want to throw a wrench into things? Director's Cut cards can often hinder your friends or change the rules to keep things interesting. Now you finally have an outlet for that wealth of movie trivia building up in your brain!  &amp;#10;Cinelinx is a new take on movie trivia games and is the perfect way to test your movie knowledge and challenge your friends during your next movie or game night!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules&amp;#10;1) Separate Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut cards from the main deck and set them aside nearby. Then shuffle the main deck and allow each player to draw 10 cards.&amp;#10;2) An anchor card is needed to start the game. We recommend locating a genre card from the main deck and dropping it in the center of the table to begin. The remaining genre cards should stay in the deck to be drawn randomly during gameplay.&amp;#10;3) Decide amongst yourselves who will go first, and then continue playing clockwise.&amp;#10;4) Players should take turns connecting cards in their hands to cards in play. Players can only play ONE card during their turn, unless instructed otherwise by a Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut card.&amp;#10;Tip: Cards can be dropped vertically or horizontally and connected to any open side of a card in play. The reels that are formed as cards connect should not touch unless a valid connection is made.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5) Connections must be verbally announced to be considered valid. A connection can be defined as the relationship between two cards. See our official rulebook for complete connection details.&amp;#10;Example announcement: &amp;ldquo;Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio can be connected because they were both in &amp;lsquo;The Wolf of Wall Street&amp;rsquo;. &amp;ldquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6) During their turn, if a player does not have a playable card in their hand they can DRAW a card and play it immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card in their hand they can draw a second time and play the card immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card then their turn is over. &amp;#10;Instead of drawing, if a player cannot play a card in their hand they can choose to SWAP up to three cards in their hand with three random cards from the main deck. Once a player has swapped cards their turn is immediately over. A player can only SWAP once per game. Cards that are discarded should be placed back into the main deck.&amp;#10;7) A connection can be challenged at any time.&amp;#10;8) The first person to shed their full hand wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut&amp;#10;During gameplay, when someone plays a Directors card from their hand they are allowed to draw from the Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut deck and should follow the instructions on the card they draw. Most Director&amp;rsquo;s Cut cards can be played immediately. &amp;#10;Challenging a play&amp;#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven VALID then the challenger must either draw a card or lose a turn. The player who was challenged can decide which option the challenger should proceed with.&amp;#10;If a connection is challenged and is proven INVALID then the player who was challenged must take their card back and draw an additional card. Their turn ends immediately after they draw.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Download the Cinelinx Rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
