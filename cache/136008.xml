						               													<description>Play as an interdimensional cowboy on the move searching for unique cows. You've come across &amp;quot;The Field&amp;quot;, a plane that seems to attract 4 particular monstrous Moos! But these Moos are difficult to capture and you need special tools if you want to stand a chance against the other cowboys who have also discovered The Field.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pull together 3 tools to specifically utilize against the different types of Moo. You can wield an EMP Rifle to take down Cyborg Moos, or trail Zombie Moos along with a Brain on a Stick. You might need a Steel Stetson to protect yourself against Dragon Moos, a Puzzle Box to trap Ghost Moos and don't leave your Faithful Companion at home, he'll help you round up any Moo you want!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Capture 25 different Moos, or get a pedigree herd of 15 on one type to win against the other cowboys.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a game with entry level tactical play. Choices are available in every step. It is meant to be a fun game for anyone to play and accessible to all levels of experience. Specifically, the game is designed to help bring players who have not had much experience with tactical play into the broader gaming market. The steps of the game are as follows:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rustle:  Draw the top two off of the deck, or one off the discard pile.  If there are not enough cards in the deck, shuffle the discard pile, place it face down and continue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Round-up:  Wrangle cows and play action cards or sit-a-spell.  If you choose to wrangle or play action cards you may play as many as you are able (including multiple sets of tools).  To sit-a-spell you may discard any number of cards from your hand at once and draw that number from the deck. If you sit-a-spell you may not play cards, and you may not sit-a spell if you have played any cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Portal: Roll the Moo Dice.  (A 6 sided die with 1 color for each Moo type and two opposite faces colored black). Place one Moo of each indicated type in the field according to the Moo Placement Rules.  If all four dice show black then a Stampede has occurred.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mosey:  Move one Moo of each color in the field one space if possible.  If there are no Moos in the field, or if none of the Moos can be moved, then skip this phase.  If there is only one Moo of a color in the field you must still move that Moo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the Mosey phase, if you have more than 7 cards in hand, discard in the order you choose until you only have 7.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
