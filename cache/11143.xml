						               													<description>An action game where moves are made on the roll the dice.  Players must move their mice on a roll of green or stay put on black.  Mice are moved off the playing surface by pulling on their tails and the box top, shaped like a wedge of cheese, is used to catch the mice.  Chips are awarded for each caught mouse. The first player to win 18 chips wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Three Blind Mice is essentially Carla Cat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Similar to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Carla Cat&amp;#10;    Carla Cat&amp;#10;    Carla Cat&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object of the Game: First Player to get 18 chips is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To Start the game each player receives nine chips. First player to roll a green spot is the &amp;quot;Catcher&amp;quot;. Other players select a mouse and place mouse on base, holding it by the tail. Catcher rolls color cube by using &amp;quot;Cheese Wedge&amp;quot; as shaker.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules of the Game: When a Blue or green spot turns up, the players must pull their mice off the base before the catcher traps them with the &amp;quot;cheese wedge&amp;quot;. If the mouse is caught, the player pays the catcher one chip. If his mouse is not caught, the player is not paid a chip by the catcher. If all the mice escape, the catcher exchanges the &amp;quot;Cheese Wedge&amp;quot; for the mouse of the player on his left and this player now becomes the catcher. When a black or white spot turns up, the players must leave their mice on the base. If a player pulls his mouse off the base when black or white turns up, he pays the catcher one chip. However, if the catcher should touch the base with the &amp;quot;cheese wedge&amp;quot; to the player on his left, and pays one chip to each of the mice still on the base. The player on his left now becomes the catcher. When a player has lost all his chips he is out of the game. As soon as one player has 18 chips he is the winner and the game is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
