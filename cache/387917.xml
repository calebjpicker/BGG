						               													<description>2-5 Players will Join Hello Kitty, My Melody, Kuromi and more on a day of exploration and discovery at the park. In Hello Kitty: Day at the Park, players are playfully competing to have the most epic day of fun at the local park. They will explore the park by laying tiles and completing adventures as the game progresses. They will gain items as they explore, and use those items to complete Adventures which they will document by taking Selfies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn, players add tiles to the park and then try to find the best location to complete their adventures (Looking for areas containing all the symbols they need).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game features a unique system to scale all parts of the game in difficulty for each individual player, even while the game is in progress. So kids can start with the most simple version, and slowly begin to explore the game's mechanics and learn the more advanced strategy as they feel ready.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all the tiles have been played, the end of the game is triggered, and the player who gained the most victory points from their adventures wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from developer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
