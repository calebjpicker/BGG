						               													<description>ARE YOU AVERAGE ENOUGH TO BE A WAPLE?&amp;#10;You, solo, or with up to three friends take, the role of a member of the worst wrestling family ever, The Waples! Play as Biff the scared wrestler, Spiff the rubber sword-wielding teen, his mom Ivanna and her charms, Randi the out-of-work model, Yodel the chef, or many others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WAPLEworlds is similar to a dungeon crawler game in that players move their characters, members of the Waple Family, around an 8x8 tile, while encountering Bad Guys and exploring exotic locations such as Pepe's Motor Lodge and the Scam and Save Pawn Shop. Yes, it is comedy themed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The starter box includes eight playable Waple figures and their Hero Cards, 25 Bad Guy Cards and their standees, over 40 item cards, over 20 Something Happened cards, Mission cards, 12 location tiles a WAPLEworld &amp;quot;newsletter&amp;quot; with rules and pre-made scenarios, 10 dice and money, damage and level tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a player's turn, he moves his character and can perform an action: search, confront a Bad Guy, use a card, or enter a building. Confronting a Bad Guy can mean to either fight him, bribe him, or run away like a chicken.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Confrontations with Bad Guys: Fighting, Bribing and Running Away, are all controlled by dice rolls based on the stats listed on both the Hero's and the Bad Guys cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After that, if not in combat, the player will draw a Something Happened card and execute what it states. If the player enters a location he rolls a die to see if a Mission is currently available there. If it is then he may try to resolve it to save that area by placing the appropriate new tile and Bad Guys onto that tile with the Waple and any that join him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The third phase of a turn is for any Bad Guy that the player is controlling to either move peacefully or attack the player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game can be played with a simple one tile and one mission limit to up to five tiles and over a dozen missions completed, based on the time limit the player wants.  Missions increase in difficulty by placing more Bullies (minions) along with the Big Shot (boss) on the Mission tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the first tile everyone starts at level 0. After the tile's mission is cleared, all Waples level up and can enhance their skills in the way the player wants, increasing dice rolled for certain stats. Bad Guys level up and roll one more die per level as well. On the second tile the Waples search and complete two missions. The game progresses as such until the final Scenario Mission has been conquered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
