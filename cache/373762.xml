						               													<description>Rotten Rampage is a standalone solo game that is included with the Token Terror board game set. The objective of the game is to assume the role of a zombie and conquer the village. As the game progresses, players are given the opportunity to acquire additional zombies to add to their arsenal. However, the task of being a zombie is not easy, as your parts can become detached, and the villagers have an array of weapons at their disposal. The fewer the villagers, the more aggressive they become, requiring players to exhibit great tenacity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game comprises several rounds, which continue until either the villagers have destroyed five out of the six zombie parts or all the villagers have become infected. The zombie parts represent the entire army's health tracker, making all infected targets vulnerable to damage, particularly toward the end. Some of the zombie parts are required for actions, such as using the zombie head to infect villagers with a coin toss. While these actions are necessary to win the game, there are spaces where players can regenerate lost parts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each zombie part and villager has a number. The villagers move through revealed cards each round, with a battle triggered whenever a villager and a zombie share the same space. Once the battle is resolved, the moving phases come to a halt. During the encounter, a dice is rolled, and if the result falls within the range listed on the attacking villager's tile, the associated number is detached from the zombie. The attack range for each villager's number is clearly printed on each tile, allowing players to develop strategies at a glance. However, the villagers could enter spaces that level up their range, flipping their tile over to give them a wider range of attacks. The tile underneath them also allows for alternative maneuvers or actions, adding to the complexity of the game. Hence, effective positioning is vital for success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
