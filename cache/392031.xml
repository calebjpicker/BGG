						               													<description>You are the dungeon master of the demon army, who has been entrusted with the dungeon, which is called &amp;quot;the town of beginning,&amp;quot; which is closest to the city of man.This dungeon is a popular dungeon where first-time adventurers come to test their skills, but strong adventurers don't visit, so they spend ordinary days dealing with first-time adventurers.However, a serious fact was discovered the other day.In fact, I discovered that the legendary holy sword used by the brave men of previous generations was hidden in the treasure which lay behind Dungeon.I found out that this holy sword was capable of cutting through mountains with one stroke.Ordinary monsters cannot even be touched by the overwhelming power of the Holy Sword.If the Sword is found by adventurers, especially the brave, it is obvious that the demon army will be inferior.Will you fight off the adventurers who challenge you one after another and protect the legendary holy sword that lies deep in Dungeon?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
