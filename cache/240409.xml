						               													<description>This is a role playing board game focused at learning and discussing the theme of collaborative economy and its relation with open digital services. In particular focuses on platform coops as an alternative crowd-sourcing model with respect to privately owned network models. A main inspiring reference is Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy by Trebor Scholz.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a board game that mixes role playing, card deck building, collaborative gameplay and transformative narrative aimed at exploring platform coops and their integration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What is the object of the game? For the single Megacorp player, to acquire all the Platform Coops transforming them in its subsidiaries. For all other players, who play as Platform Coops, to earn 5 happiness points. Players can decide whether the game ends as soon as one Platform Coop reaches their goal, or all are required to reach the 5 happiness points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How is it won or lost? Players win when they reach their goal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What do players do in their turns? Each player picks a new card which goes in their hand, and also may play a card as a new service of the coop or Megacorp. Each player has then to pay taxes and compute earnings, which are determined by the cards that they have played. For coop players, the effects of the cards of their deck are integrated with those of the shared service which require all coops subscription to become effective.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is available as print and play, all materials available on Github with the rules. On Youtube there is a how-to-play video.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
