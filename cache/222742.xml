						               													<description>In Mojo Samurai, your clan will have to use the ressources that destiny gives it to lead its samurais to victory.&amp;#10;Each player will fight enemy clans in a war without mercy for the control of the territory.  This games plays in 3 rounds, and each rounds ends with a moment of truth that is brutal and short lasted. Mojo Samurai is inspired of the classic Koi-Koi (or Hanafuda).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the begining of a round, Players deploy their samurais on deployement locations. (either their HQ, or an encampment that was built in a previous round)&amp;#10;Then, they draw 8 cards, the cards ranges from number 1 to three, in 4 different colors, and they contain one of 4 symbols)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;8 more cards are placed face up on the table.&amp;#10;The players turn by turn associate card from their hand with a card on the table forming a pair (with matching number and color) If the color they associated is their clan color, they get a free deployment (placing one samurai in a deployment location) and they can make a number of movement with their samurais equal to the number on the cards they associated.  For example, the red player associate a card with number 2 red from his hand, and 2 red from the table, he picks those cards up and places them in front of him. He then moves either 1 samurai of 2 spaces, or 2 samurais of 1 space.  Since he associated a card of his color, he also gets to deploy (before or after movement) a samurai on the battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After associating a card, the player can spend the cards he accumulated by association using the various symbols on the cards to either destroy the content of a tile, build a fortress, build an encampment, get more movements, or deploy more samurais.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battles on the field is one for one. Meaning that if a samurai attacks a space with one enemy samurai, both are destroyed, and the tile becomes free.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the content of a tile is destroyed with the use of card symbols, a fortress (if present) on the targeted tile is sacrificed instead, saving the units present.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a round is finished, (with no associations possible, or no card symbols can be spend anymore) 2 victory points are allowed for the players controlling most tiles, the player with the most samurai on the battlefield, the player with most fortress on the field, the player with most encampments on the field, tied players get 1 points. and 1 point for each controlled special locations, and 3 point for controling the center tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After three rounds, the winner is the player with the most victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
