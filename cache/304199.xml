						               													<description>Mega City a Moloch of a city was flashy, loud and dirty. Life was hard and survival was complicated. If you knew the right people in Mega City it was easier. If you did what you were told, it was also easy. But the easiest way was to simply not stand out, become invisible, merge with the haze of the city and stay out of everything. What do I care? That&amp;rsquo;s the way it is. Many of the young people didn't mind, they were just interested in having fun, being cool and being able to do what they wanted to do. Why should one then interfere with the stress that the old people made for themselves. Until, yes, until you faced reality, staring at you brutally and cruelly, punching you in the face, breaking your bones or snuffing out your lights. &amp;#10;That reality was a man whom everybody only referred to as &amp;rdquo;The Baron&amp;rdquo;, the crime lord who controlled everything in Mega City. His army of henchmen was everywhere and enforced his will with unlimited brutality and cruelty. &amp;#10;In Secret Hunters, each player leads a group of young people who have formed a gang with the goal of overthrowing The Baron. They all share the fate of having been brutally abused by The Baron and his henchmen. To achieve their goal are not choosy with their methods. They hack terminals, crack safes, bribe the followers of the mystery man, but they would never use weapons. Each gang consists of 4 specialists. A hacker, a safecracker, a spy and a biker. Using the action board and 4 action tokens, the characters are guided through Mega City, but, The Baron does not just watch as his weaknesses uncovered, his henchmen strike mercilessly. Four pieces of evidence need to be found and presented to the court in order to take out The Baron, but to find out which four pieces of evidence they are, the players need to collect clues they get from informants, as to where relevant safes and terminals are located which may contain possible evidence. The gang which has collected all four pieces of evidence and manages to take them to court wins the game and is referred to by the others as the real Secret Hunters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
