						               													<description>The hottest football game not just for football fans! Footballiser is a board game in which you can conquer the world of football as both a team leader, club owner and a football player. A game where you not only get to use your strategic skills alongside your dexterity, but also have to exploit both if you want to win the cup!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of Footballiser is to be the first player to obtain all 6 Stadium Development Items and to win the league final! Footballiser is a turn-based game, meaning in each round players get to decide what action(s) to take. Each round comprises two phases: using of an Action Card and carrying out an operation. An operation may be opting for a Stadium or Team Development (either via trading in trophies previously won for successful matches, or by rolling the Development Dice), or playing a match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stadium Development Items are to be put on one&amp;rsquo;s Development Board, except at the start all 6 sections of the Development Board are occupied by a certain number of flags. To remove flags and therefore to make place for possible Stadium Developments, one has to win matches. When it comes to playing matches, a player has to draw a Match Cards. Match Cards come in four different difficulty levels, often depicting famous football situations. All 50 Match Cards are unique, providing you a pool of possibilities that would be extremely hard to get bored of. The Footballiser Field consist of numbered cells, making Match Cards easily understandable, and the footballer figures easily placeable on the board. One must flick the figures in a way that the figures push to ball to a selected few cells that count as a successful pass, and repeat the process a few times to kick the ball through the goal line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After winning the match, the player gets to decide which section to free up for Stadium Development, although it shall not be random, as the usage of Action Cards and Power Cards are often conditioned on a certain level of Stadium Development. Power Cards provide you with a higher chance of winning matches, for example by allowing you to try again certain shots or skip otherwise necessary passes on your way to the goal. Action Cards either provide help for your development in game, or offer up an opportunity to set someone else&amp;rsquo;s development back, for example by having them put Development Items back in the pack or by making them skip turns or limiting their choice when their turn comes. If all the flags are taken off of the Development Board, all Stadium Development Items are placed on their rightful places on the Development Board, you may proceed to play the league final. When you win that, you win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
