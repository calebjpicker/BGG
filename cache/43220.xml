						               													<description>The game Triad was self-published by Sid Sackson in 1957 and was the third game &amp;quot;published&amp;quot; by him chronologically. Poke was published in Esquire Magazine in 1946, and he published Slam himself in 1951. Slam, since it has more rules, came in an approximately 4&amp;quot;x2&amp;quot; white paper booklet. Both of these games would be reprinted in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games in 1969, while Triad would appear (slightly modified) as Pe-Ling in 1970. Triad was then published in GAMES magazine in 1986, while Pe-Ling was presented at Spiel in 1989 and in included in an issue #5 of Spielbox in 1990.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Triad is similar to Mah Jongg, but uses a special deck made from two decks of cards using only the ace through 8 of each suit. For four players, a third set of cards is added. The rules mostly detail scoring for the various hands that can be formed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, players try to combine twelve cards in three sets of four cards, each set belonging to one of the three classes allowed. To do this, players can choose to take a face-up card from the draw pile or a face-down card from the discard pile. A set of the Class 1 type consists of four cards of the same suit. For Class 2 sets, each four cards should be arranged as two pairs, with the sum of the values being 9 (e.g., 2, 2 and 7, 7). Class 3 is about making groups of four cards of the same number (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 2). In each Class, some cards combinations are considered weak, easy or strong, giving 2, 4 or 8 points, respectively. Moreover, there are several conditions and card combinations that add doubling factors progressively to the total sum. In this way, one doubling multiplies the points by a factor of 2, two by 4, three by 8, etc. The game lasts several rounds until a player reaches a predetermined amount of points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
