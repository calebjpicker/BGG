						               													<description>Did You Really Just is an adult party game that requires you to spit out the first thing that pops into your head. A &amp;quot;Challenger&amp;quot; starts the game by flipping over a category card such as &amp;quot;When I drink Tequila I...&amp;quot; They then challenge each person at the table one by one by flipping over a letter card which has a random letter of the alphabet on it. The first person (between the challenger and the person they are battling) to shout out a word or short phrase, fitting the category and starting with that letter, wins the letter card. They then move on to the next person at the table in a clockwise rotation. After everyone at the table has been challenged the &amp;quot;challenger&amp;quot; passes the letter cards to the person on their left and now that person is the new &amp;quot;challenger&amp;quot;. They flip over a new category card and play continues in the same pattern.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all letter cards have been played, this concludes round one. Everyone counts their letter cards and the person with the most cards wins that round. Keep a tally of the winner and shuffle the letter cards to start a new round. You can play as many rounds as you like until the group decides they are done playing or you run out of category cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The answers you give to each category card do not have to be truthful, but they do need to make sense. For Example if the category is &amp;quot;When I Drink Tequila I...&amp;quot; and the letter is &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; you can answer &amp;quot;Streak!&amp;quot; even if you have never actually done that. If you answered &amp;quot;Shoe&amp;quot; that does not make sense with the category and the group takes a vote on if it fits or not. If they say it does not fit you re-do this battle by putting that letter card back into the deck and flipping over a new letter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all rounds have been played the person who has won the most rounds (has the most tally's) is the ultimate champion!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
