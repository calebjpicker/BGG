						               													<description>Dish of Spurs (DoS) is a set of miniature rules for skirmish actions during the Border Reivers period.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In DoS players lead bands of raiders or the forces out to stop them. Each unit gets two actions per turn with which they may move, shoot, herd cattle, break down doors, etc. Captains confer bonus actions on their troops and heroes inspire their fellows to greater bravery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions generally require a die roll to succeed, and all dice are normal d6. To shoot for example, you must roll higher than your shoot score. To rally, you must roll higher than your morale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is scenario driven, with victory varying according to circumstance. A raider may win by getting a certain number of cattle off the board, the local marshal wins by preventing them. Or perhaps two clans fight over a wedding, one seeking to prevent the union, the other to see it carried through.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes an optional hidden movement rule which while slowing play adds a lot of nuance to the tactics of each side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
