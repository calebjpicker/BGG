						               													<description>A Battle of Onin is a strategic trick-taking card game, designed for between 2-4 players. It offers some mechanics reminiscent of classic games such as Spades, Euchre, Pinochle and Hearts, but with incredibly nuanced gameplay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to play: &amp;#10;13 cards are dealt to each player. Each player sets a bid for how many tricks they'll try to win; high card wins the trick! Collect too many tricks and over time you will become corrupted and your influence will suffer.  Collect too few tricks and you won't keep up with your adversaries! Strategize with your enemies to survive; you may have to make risky decisions in the process. But remember, allegiances change rapidly. Score the most influence points to win without being negatively affected by your corruption.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What separates A Battle of Onin from other traditional trick-taking games?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A reimagined 52 card deck along with familiar mechanics offers a new challenge for experienced trick-takers; while players who are unfamiliar with the genre will learn with ease.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With a cohesive blend of subtle complexity, cooperative elements, and unique strategies, A Battle of Onin requires the ability to play offensively and defensively simultaneously; as every hand can and must be strategized to your advantage...even the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Battle of Onin is designed to be color-blind friendly. For players who are colorblind, we have kanji symbols denoting color and faction; Featuring four unique characters that are easily distinguishable. Provided is a key to help translate the symbols and play seamlessly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because we know that skill levels vary, what makes this game stand apart from the rest is it's malleability. A Battle of Onin is Modular. We encourage you to play the multiple variants of gameplay we detail that fit your skill/enjoyment level. From basic, to advanced to expert mode. We also encourage you to implement your own ideas and house rules to maximize your fun-factor. Be creative and make the game as enjoyable as possible!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beyond all that is the ease it takes to learn, set up, shuffle up and play. Though it takes minutes to learn, new players can play competitively almost immediately.  This gives A Battle of Onin re-playability. Most of the time, we don't just play one game. We play 2 or 3.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
