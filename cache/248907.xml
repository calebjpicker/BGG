						               													<description>&amp;quot;After centuries of never-ending wars, the dark magic of Faer has taken hold of the lands of Euthia. One of the most powerful mages, the mighty Rasgaroth, had succumbed to this darkness. He was leeching away the energy of all living things wherever he appeared. As his power grew, Euthia was in danger of being engulfed by this evil. The mages of the order of Vis forged a secret union to deter this looming threat. After many years of studying ancient tomes of forbidden knowledge, they eventually found a way to awaken mighty dragons, control them and with their help to defeat Rasgaroth and his minions. The mages were successful - Rasgaroth was torn to pieces by dragons and his fortress, Arakius, was reduced to ashes. The wars were over. But some of these mages thrived for even greater power and tried to use the mighty dragons for goals of their own. However, their magic was not powerful enough to control the dragons forever. Dragons eventually broke free of their masters control and ripped them apart. The order of Vis was brought to an end. The retribution of the dragons was about to begin...&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Legends of Euthia is a strategic competitive role-playing game set in a medieval fantasy world. The land of Euthia is threatened by powerful dragons who, with powerful elementals, destroy one village after another and the dragons themselves seek to destroy the last hope - the Church of St. Michael. Become one of the four heroes: the priestess of light, &amp;Aacute;el; the unstoppable warrior, Dral; the cunning and wild rogue, Keleia; or the fire mage Maeldur. Protect the remaining villages, the church and kill all three dragons. As one of these heroes, you will have unique abilities and various strategies. Explore Euthia and fight dangerous monsters controlled by other players who try to kill you with various monster cards. Get loot and rewards from victorious battles and you mine resources at specific places on the map. With these resources and loot, you can buy equipment and new skills from the markets. During the game all heroes gain reputation for fighting dragons, monsters or elementals, for liberating various places of trade and locations with rare resources, but also for conquering and gemstone mining. The winner is the player with the most reputations points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup:&amp;#10;Players choose whether they want to play the basic game or the champions version for more of a challenge. Each player selects a hero and prepares the specific hero board. Then the other boards are prepared; the game board where reputation points and rounds are counted; the trade board with specific market offers and the combat board with monster cards and elemental cards. After that the starting tile with the church is placed in the middle of the playing area (where the heroes start their adventure). Other tiles are sorted by chapters; separate chapters are shuffled and then sorted into the correct chapter order. Each player rolls two dice, and the one with the highest amount begins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Course of the game:&amp;#10;Players take turns in a clockwise direction. Each turn, a player can use action tokens to carry out different strategies. They try to get as many reputation points, golden coins and other accessories (monster ability cards, potions and Gaars, used for re-rolling) as possible by using these tokens. By gaining reputation, heroes unlock new abilities which can be learned by paying gold coins. Heroes can also buy new equipment and heal wounds inflicted in combat. In mountains, lakes and caves, heroes can mine rare raw resources to get more gold and reputation points. During specific turns, elemental monsters begin their invasion of Euthia and must be destroyed by the heroes to protect places of trade and the portals of Euthia. If the elementals are not killed by a certain round, the place is destroyed and reduced to a common piece of land (mountains, lakes, caves). During a dragon attack, all heroes are teleported back to the church, healed and then encounter the dragon. They do not help each other during the attack but try to inflict as much damage to the dragon individually, because when the dragon is eventually slain, the reputation points are distributed to heroes according to the damage caused. The hero dealing the most damage also gets a special reward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Movement &amp;ndash; Movement is carried out on the map by using action tokens, equipped boots, jewelry, special abilities or portals. The combat action token can be used for a combat action or 3 movement points, the trade action token can also be additionally used as 2 movement points, and the mining action token can be also used as a one movement point. Moving to an adjacent map tile costs one movement point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Map exploration - new map tiles are placed on the board when a hero moves to an edge of the explored area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Fighting monsters - by entering a monster map tile the player must use a combat action. The encountered monster is controlled by the player sitting on the right or a different player can take over the monster by playing a monster ability card - Mind control or Magical mind control. It is not possible to run from combat and the first player to attack is the player controlling the monster. He or she rolls 2 dice and determines the attack strength according to the monster cards and monster ability cards used. The dice can be re-rolled using Gaars which come in a limited amount for both heroes and monsters. Next, the player controlling the hero chooses an ability they want to use to attack, rolls 2 dice and determines the attack power or eventually multiple abilities can be combined. These phases repeat until either the hero or the monster dies. After slaying a monster, the hero is rewarded with reputation points, corresponding number of monster ability cards and loot from the map tile. If a hero dies the player controlling the hero gives their token to the player who controlled the monster. For this token, the monster-controlling player gains 2 reputation points and the hero-controlling player loses 2 reputation points at the end of the game. The slain hero is revived in the church and is given 4 Gaar tokens by the priests, a specific number of monster ability cards depending on the turn they were killed in and then they can get back in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Trade - by entering a tile with one of the three places of trade and using the trade action token, a hero can spend any gold coins they have to get equipment, healing, new abilities, potions and Gaars. It is also possible to sell items or, just once per encounter, to refresh all things being offered by the vendor. Each place offers different things to buy. If a hero liberates a place of trade from enemies, they are paid one gold coin by other heroes using this place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Mining - A hero can use the mining action on places designated for the action (mountains, lakes, caves) to get a piece of raw resource which can be traded for gold and reputation points. Each hero can mine each tile only once per game. If you perform the mining action on a tile occupied by a different hero, you pay one gold coin to each hero who has their hero token on the tile. Then you also place your hero token on that tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Milestones:&amp;#10;You do not have to start a new game from the first round over and over again. You can decide to start your new game from a milestone. Setup the regular game with few modifications. Start the game from a different map tile chapter, you have some reputation points right from the start (meaning some hero abilities are unlocked) and gold that can be traded for items and vendor services even before the game starts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can also agree that the game will be concluded sooner than the 24th round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game for champions:&amp;#10;The champions version is prepared in the same way as the regular game, but the game board, the trade board and the hero boards must be turned with the goblet-icon up. Additionally, quest cards are used in the champions version. The course of the game is the same as in the regular game with the exception that no events take place, apart from the fight with the dragon Brasath in the 21st round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Compared to the regular game, there are numbers in the gold coin symbol next to the picture of the trade points on the trade board for the champions version. During their Trade action, a player may place their hero token on this tile to claim it if they spend the amount stated. Some hero boards already contain basic equipment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unlike the regular game, there are quests in the champions version. If a player is successful in completing these quests they are rewarded with reputation and gold. The quest cards are divided into three levels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending the game:&amp;#10;The game ends in a predetermined round or if players do not defend the church against one of the dragons. At the end of the game, reputation points are awarded for claimed locations on the map, the loot and the hero tokens that the players got by killing other heroes when controlling monsters. The player with the highest number of reputation points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
