						               													<description>The world's first and only ambigram card game will test your guts, your will and your game strategy while it surprises you with its amazing game cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are simple: Each card in your hand contains an ambigram, containing one word when it is read upright, and another word when it is read upside-down (like &amp;quot;Angel&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Finger&amp;quot;).  You can play either of those two words on either of the two words that are currently displayed on the deck (like &amp;quot;Drink&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Angel&amp;quot;).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sure, the first few rounds are simple, since you have lots of different ways to play out the possibilities in your hand, but you had better plan ahead and pay attention to what cards your opponents have, because the game gets trickier in the final few rounds.  Don't get caught drawing a fist full of cards when your opponents are almost out!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To make the game even more challenging, your opponent might zing you at any time by slapping you with a &amp;quot;Double Joker&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Double Angel&amp;quot; card that contains the same word in both directions, doubling the chances that you'll have to draw!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course, you could plan to zing them back with a &amp;quot;Double Siren&amp;quot;, but don't get caught holding that card in your hand for long, because not only is it twice as hard for your opponent to play on, it's also twice as hard for you to get rid of!  You had better plan ahead, or your scheme to attack at the end when it can hurt the most might come back to bite YOU!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Simple to learn, but filled with plenty of twists (literally), Ambigram! the game provides hours of fun for the whole family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;About the Playing Cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Ambigram deck itself is a wonder of modern technology that no human being could have designed alone, even if they possessed several lifetimes to work on the problem.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Instead, a computer was given the task of finding the words to use for the cards.  It was programmed to go through the entire English Dictionary, word by word, and locate 7 words that could all form an ambigram with themselves, and also form an ambigram with every one of the other 7 words that were being located - a total of 49 ambigrams in all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It took the computer 16 days to go through the Dictionary and return the answer: Angel, Drink, Finger, Joker, Killer, Learn and Siren - the amazing set of words that make up all of the 49 cards for Ambigram! the Game.  Those 49 ambigram cards are joined by a single Wild card, for a total of 50 spinnable round cards that play out differently every time!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
