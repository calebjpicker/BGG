						               													<description>Pangaex is a world-conquering game with aspects of Risk, Catan, and Terraforming Mars. The game is played on a modular board (81 2&amp;quot;-square tiles), each of which indicates one of the following resources: Culture, Food, Weapons, Commerce, Mountains, or Lakes. Each player starts with a Capital game piece and two village game pieces, which are placed in a snake-draft system. Each player also begins with some resources and a soldier, who begins the game on the Capital tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in two repeating phases: Production phase (collecting resources based on villages and/or soldiers in play), and Action phase. The Production phase happens simultaneously, where all players collect resources at the same time. The Action phase is where the bulk of the game is played. Players can move their soldiers; they can also use resources to build villages, train soldiers, and even convert enemy villages to their own culture. Like Terraforming Mars, each player may take up to two actions on their turn--however, a pass is not a pass for the whole Action phase, but merely a pass on a given turn. The Action phase ends when all players have passed consecutively.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Soldiers are more than just soldiers in Pangaex. Soldiers raze enemy villages, but they also help to rebuild their own villages. They prevent peaceful cultural conversion, and they even collect resources at times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When any player plays their final village, the game ends after the Action phase concludes (i.e. final village signifies final round, not final play). Points are awarded for villages on the board, enemy villages that you've collected (by razing or converting), and other metrics to balance out the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
