						               													<description>&amp;quot;In 1924 middle England at the residence of an esteemed occult collector, a Mr John Wilson, a murder was discovered. John had been in the middle of a dinner party with some good friends when his wife screamed from the garden. Tabitha Wilson had been taking a walk for some after dinner air when she came across the remains of the gardener. The poor man had been decapitated and eviscerated on the lawn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The Police were called to the scene and the investigation begun. Yet more horror was to come. A strange rustling noise came from the hedges at the end of the garden and it drew everyone's eyes. In a sudden rush men burst through the greenery each wielding a knife and screaming for blood.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;John's first thoughts were for the valuable occult Artefacts he had placed around the gardens pathways. He had been planning a tour of the gardens and his Artefacts as after-dinner entertainment. He rushed towards the oncoming fiends calling his friends to help. Suddenly the yelling interlopers fell silent and stepped aside and through their ranks stepped a huge fearsome betentacled thing...&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a Print and Play game based on the Cthulhu stories by H.P. Lovecraft. The objective of the game is to collect all three Artefacts -- a player wins when he has all three Artefacts in the Hexs of his own base line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
