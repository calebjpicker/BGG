						               													<description>In a dystopian past, Captain Omni encounters the Kraken, a cephalopod-like sea monster of gigantic size. The first documented evidence of the Kraken&amp;rsquo;s mesmerizing and destructive power dates back to an obscure manuscript from 1180. In two torn pages of this journal manuscript, the captain describes the discovery by luck of the lost City of Atlantis. Through this diary, we learn about  Houses - factions that control the City, castles with enormous cogs, flying vehicles, a giant clock that controls the time, and sea monsters that live inside seawater pyramids!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Atlantis Omni is a unique, handmade with pyrography strategy board game for 2-4 players, that puts you in the role of the leader of one or two factions, that are trying to prevail to control the City of Atlantis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each faction controls 1 of the 4 elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Void), 1 castle with 2 gears, and 4 vehicles that move and battle with opposing vehicles. In the City, there is a Great clock to control the time, stopping spots for vehicles, and spots such as Harbors and Faction Bases. There are also four water pyramids each one with a  sea - monster Kraken inside, that help the factions to create Alchemy with the 4 elements.&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;The Castles-cogs control the energy of the faction and the alchemy capabilities. The vehicles are moving or flying with a die and they are used to confront the vehicles of other factions. There are 4 types of Alchemy as many as the 4 elements: a) Water Alchemy to remove time, b) Earth Alchemy to remove the land c) Fire Alchemy to control vehicles, and d) Void Alchemy to replenish energy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players have the goal to control the spots of the Bases and Ports with their vehicles, in order to win Atlantian points, but the game ends at the moment that the Great Clock shows 9. The player who has the greater number of points at that moment is the winner of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While players have their own separate strategies, they are all limited by the time of the Great Clock which affects most of their actions, like the vehicle battles, and the alchemies of the elements. The factions are using their energy influence to change them, but the factor of luck is also very important. Through careful planning and strategic actions, you will do your best to increase the power of your faction and carry out your agenda. Will you be the one to lead your faction to control the city of Atlantis?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
