						               													<description>Politics: The Debate is a card game for would-be political leaders. Players take on the role of politicians and try to convince each other they, and they alone, can solve socio-political issues. If you enjoy debating fiscal responsibility one turn, and the feasibility of solving homelessness by imprisoning the homeless the next, The Debate is the game for you.&amp;#10;Players begin by separating and shuffling the two decks &amp;ndash; ISSUES and POLCIES. The issues deck should be placed face-down on the table, and each player takes five policy cards to form a hand. The youngest player starts as the dealer, and they turn over the top issue card. This represents a particular problem that all the players, as politicians, want to look like they can solve. Players do this by playing two Policy cards from their hand. Each player does this going clockwise around the group, starting with the player after the dealer. Each player plays his/her two cards and explains briefly (30ish seconds) how the two Policies they have played solve the particular issue.&amp;#10;After each player has played his/her two Policies, players debate each other in a calm and collected fashion, gently critiquing each other&amp;rsquo;s policies while defending their own. When that&amp;rsquo;s done, go for the jugular &amp;ndash; mercilessly attack your opponent&amp;rsquo;s stupid policies, compare them unfavourably to your fiscally-sound utopian masterplan, and suggest they&amp;rsquo;re like Hitler somehow. Maybe bite someone. When this is done, vote for a winner &amp;ndash; the player whose Policies were the best. Remember to vote for the player who did the best at explaining, justifying and defending their Policies &amp;ndash; not the player who suggested Policies closest to your personal ideology.&amp;#10;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve voted, take a note of the score and continue. The player to the left of the dealer becomes the new dealer, he or she deals two new policy cards to the player (bringing their hand back up to five), and turns over a new issue card. The whole horrible mess goes on like this until players either run out of issues or, if they want to reshuffle the issues and keep playing, until a pre-defined end time (or when you&amp;rsquo;ve had enough). Then the player with the most points is declared winner. Players should take this time to congratulate him/her, and re-visit contentious debates from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
