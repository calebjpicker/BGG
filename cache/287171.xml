						               													<description>It is the Age of the Goremageddon and GRAXX is in a new wave of absolute carnage, brutality and ultra-violence. Along the highways, in hidden territories and throughout the wastelands, abandoned outposts sit, just waiting to be pillaged for everything that sits within. Thrashers engage these outposts, unsure of what awaits them inside: resources, weaponry, relics or even hordes of endless mutants, just lurking in every corner, waiting to feast on the flesh of those who wander within...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mutant Outpost Massacre is a solitaire game of outpost-raiding in the post apocalyptic universe of Goremageddon (CPOP's flagship tabletop miniatures game; the third edition debuts soon). Players take the roles of 'thrashers' who raid outposts throughout the planet of GRAXX in the hopes of coming across rare items, resources, weapons and engage enemies in a non-stop massacre.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be played in a single session, however, thrashers can continue their exploits in an ongoing career; the game only truly ends when your thrasher perishes. After a successful raid, thrashers gain experience, which is used to purchase new weapons, items and add skills, making them more powerful as they head into raid after raid after raid. Upon the final encounter of their raid, thrashers will face bosses, who will attempt to thwart their efforts to escape. Future expansions (coming soon) will add new encounters, new outposts, new enemies, new traps, bosses and so much more, making the game something players will want to come back to, time and time again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We welcome you to the Mutant Outpost Massacre. May you live, die and thrash.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goremageddon is heavily inspired by over-the-top violence, exploitation, gore, horror, humor and post apocalyptic films on the 1980s, as well as RetroWave and Thrash Metal music. Goremageddon is also CPOP's flagship project, made popular by a cult following and already headed into a third edition, due to release soon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
