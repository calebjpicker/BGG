						               													<description>In Battle of the Hexes, players will take part in a war of spell cards. They play as mages with a set of spells they choose from, who do battle to the death. There are different types of magic as well as different types of spells; and the player must carefully select their strategy and spells to defeat their opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must each build a hand of 15 cards, by drawing by turn from a draft of cards. These cards can then be played on different lanes, damaging only what is in their path unless stated otherwise on the card. If no other card is in their respective lane, damage from the cards goes directly to the opposing player&amp;rsquo;s health. Once a player loses all their health, they lose the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;General Gameplay:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay occurs over several stages. Players keep track of whose turn it is through the turn indicator card. They must simply flip it when their turn ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Draw Stage:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the draw stage: All cards sets should be shuffled first. Determine a starting player, that player is dealt the &amp;ldquo;Destruction Spells&amp;rdquo; set of cards. Then they will choose one to keep for their hand, and pass the rest of the cards to the opposing player, who will then choose one of their own, and return it to the starting player again. That process should repeat itself until each player has a maximum of 5 cards of that particular set. Any remaining cards should be placed aside for later use in the game. Afterwards, that same process is repeated with the &amp;ldquo;Summoning Spells&amp;rdquo; set of cards, followed by the &amp;ldquo;Alteration Spells&amp;rdquo; set of cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play Stage:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This stage is where players play the cards they have chosen during the Draw Stage. The starting player from the previous stage starts here. During this stage, players get to use their 6 stamina points to play cards they have in their hand. Each card requires a certain amount of stamina points to be played. Any unused stamina points at the end of this stage cannot be used as extra in the next round. For the first round only: once the player has played all the cards they want, it is then the opposing player&amp;rsquo;s turn to play their cards in the same manner. Each card type must be placed in the correct area of the battlefield sheet according to their respective type symbols. &amp;ldquo;Destruction&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Alteration&amp;rdquo; cards must remain face down until the Battle Stage starts. Players may stack up as many of these cards in one lane as they want, but only one &amp;ldquo;Summoning&amp;rdquo; card is allowed in one lane at a time. Players may draw cards from any of the draw decks at any time during this stage, but it will cost them 1 stamina point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battle Stage:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During this stage, the player who played their cards last gets to attack first. The players&amp;rsquo; cards will deal damage to the opposing player&amp;rsquo;s cards only on their respective lanes unless stated - otherwise on the card - and according to their damage points on the card. Damage is done to both sides simultaneously. Cards that belong to the same spell class deal only half damage to each other. Any card that loses all its HP points must be discarded. All discarded cards are returned to their respective draw deck, placed at the bottom of each. If the opposing player&amp;rsquo;s lane is empty, then damage would go directly to that player&amp;rsquo;s own HP. Players keep track of how much damage each card is dealt through the red health pieces. One red health piece means the card lost one HP, and so on. Players keep track of their own health through the counters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following this stage it is back to the play stage for the opposing player. Whenever players run out of cards, each draw deck is taken and reshuffled, and the players draft cards between each other in another Draw Stage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
