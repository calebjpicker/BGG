						               													<description>It's Time to Conquer Earth is a card and dice game, where you play the part of a wacky alien, scrambling to get a foothold on earth for your impending invasion before those silly humans realize what you are up to and retaliate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns rolling their ships, (represented as dice of varying sizes,) to either abduct numerous different characters on the board, ranging from cows to kings, or to acquire tech, which is used to buy bigger and better ships, or to play one of the cards special to your given alien race. These cards will let you modifiy your rolls, make different characters easier to abduct, let you mess with other people's ships, and numerous other effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Characters have varying difficulties, representing how well you have to roll to abduct them. You start out with a 6 sided die, but you may buy larger dice with tech as the game progresses. Upon abducting a character, you may choose to brainwash them, netting you influence points, or you may choose to keep them contained to take advantage of their various effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each time a character is abducted, the threat level goes up, representing how aware the humans are of your shenanigans. As the threat gets higher, so to does the difficulty of the game, as the humans start to retaliate or protect themselves in different ways. The game ends once the threat reaches 100, where the humans are finally acutely aware of your presence and ready to retaliate. At that time, each player counts up their influence points, and the player with the most influence points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
