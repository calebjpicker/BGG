						               													<description>TAMGA(Mark, Clan-Banner) board game description:&amp;#10;The players take the role of clan leaders of Anatolia and try to gain control of enemy clan leaders' capital cities to become the ultimate ruler of an empire. If a player loses his capital city, he is left out of the game. There are optional rules for winning: world domination, timed game play etc. The game map resembles RISK but the Tamga game map covers territories from eastern Europe, Anatolia and northern Africa. Battle mechanics involve dice rolling, army hiring and paying their upkeep cost, buying culture cards to be able to hire more powerful armies. Each clan has an army-location-figure to represent their army on the game map. A player can not have more than one army. The army of a player consists of maximum 3 squads. (Janissaries, Cavalry, Ranged attackers etc.)  Specific cities have to be captured to hire specific squads. More powerful squads can be hired from more powerful neutral cities. A player has to defeat the militia of a neutral city to be able to hire those squads. The Tamga game comes with 6-sided(d6) special dice. Each die have three Star faces, two Crescent faces and one Sword face. Different squads have to roll different symbols to be successful. The cards representing the squads have special abilities against other squads written on them. More powerful armies require cultural achievements. The culture cards have historical flavor text on them and a culture point value at the bottom. A player has to pay money(AKCE) to buy culture cards and hire squads. The game comes with a small pouch filled with yellow and white metal coins called Akce. The coins are designed true to the original coins of era.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(from the official Tamga board game website):&amp;#10;TAMGA is a tactical strategic board game about the Ottoman Empire that takes place during from its the foundation until the end of its golden era. Players take role of Turkish leaders and try to defeat other players to become the ultimate ruler of Ottoman Empire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The flavor texts on game cards, the money currency of the game called &amp;quot;akce&amp;quot; pieces, drawings of soldiers and Ottoman Empire game map are the result of hundreds of hours of research from historical literature.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The creation of game's historical texts and design took nearly four years of careful research and reading. During this time Associate Professor Erhan Afyoncu have been consulted numerous times to provide a true to the original historical experience for the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
