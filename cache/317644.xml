						               													<description>Object- Score 500 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player gets a board with 10 poker hands listed. 2 decks of cards with jokers (which are wild for anything except a Royal Flush) are shuffled, and each player receives 7. Each turn, a player can play as few or as many cards as they wish, they may also discard as many cards as they like. Cards are played face down to the board- and once played, are not looked at until the end of the round. Player may then draw up to three cards (only from the deck, not the discard pile), with a 7 card maximum hand size.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each space is dedicated to one specific poker category, and may be completed in one or more turns. Once a space is filled with the number of cards needed to make the listed hand, a chip is placed to mark that space as complete. Once all 10 hands on a board are completed, a player can call &amp;quot;full board&amp;quot;, giving players 1 last turn each (discards may be reshuffled and made into a new draw deck as many times as there are players- the round ends immediately when a player can't draw cards, which is common with 3 or 4 players as a full board takes 40 cards to complete). The spaces are then checked. For each space, the player with the strongest completed hand scores the value of the space:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any two cards (high card, no pair)- 3 points&amp;#10;One pair- 5 points&amp;#10;Two pair- 7 points&amp;#10;Three of a Kind- 8 points&amp;#10;Straight- 10 points&amp;#10;Flush- 15 points&amp;#10;Full House- 20 points&amp;#10;Four of a Kind- 30 points&amp;#10;Straight Flush- 40 points&amp;#10;Royal Flush- 60 points (must be natural- no jokers)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ties in any space split the points rounded down. No score if the hand is incorrect or incomplete. The player who called &amp;quot;full board&amp;quot; scores 25 points if all 10 hands on their board are correct (even if some don't eventually score). If they called incorrectly, they lose 25 points. Play as many rounds as needed for someone to get 500 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire is played with one deck plus jokers- player gets 7 cards, plays exactly 3 at a time to spaces or discard, then draws 3. After going through the deck once or completing the board, player scores value of correctly completed hands plus 10 points for each card in hand or remaining in draw pile, minus 10 points for every card discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
