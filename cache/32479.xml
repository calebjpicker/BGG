						               													<description>(from Mikugames website:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Officially the Lapland War started with the Finnish naval landing at Tornio (at the Swedish border) October 1st, 1944. This was a bold surprise attack in the Germans back, the former brother in arms. Since September 4th, 1944, Finland was no longer at war with the Red Army, as the so called Continuation War had ended. One tough part of the peace terms was, that all German units were to be handed over to the Soviet Union. Because this was impossible, due to the fact that there was over 210.000 Germans in the northern Finland, the former brothers in arms had to fight each other under the supervision of the Soviet control commission. In the Barents Sea region, in an attempt to crush the German &amp;ldquo;20.Gebirgs-Armee&amp;rdquo; once and for all, the Soviet Army launched a large-scale attack called the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation. The last Germans left the Finnish soil in April, 1945.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game&amp;#10;The final volume of the trilogy is an expansion, also loaded with a lot of extra features for the complete trilogy. In other words, to be able to fully use this package, ownership of both the earlier volumes is a requirement. The Lapland War game includes also the German operations &amp;quot;Tanne West&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tanne Ost&amp;quot; as well as the &amp;quot;Birke&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Nordlicht&amp;quot; plans. The Lapland War game is divided in two separate battles, the one between the retreating Germans and Finnish units and the one between the German Mountain Corps and the Red Army north of the polar circle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unit Counters&amp;#10;The game will include one countersheet in a total of 266 die-cut unit counters. Ground units are written in standard Nato symbols, while Air and Naval units have correct silhouettes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Mapboard&amp;#10;No map is included in the Lapland War expansion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Rules&amp;#10;A 8-page coloured rule booklet includes special rules for the Lapland War expansion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Order of Battle (OOB)&amp;#10;The three full-colour OOBs (Finnish, German and Soviet) include a Main Campaign and two Small Scenarios: (1) Tornio-Kemi '44, and (2) Petsamo-Kirkkenes '44. See further in the Beta News menu. A lot of sources have been used to make them as historically correct as possible. For added feeling, the OOB's are written in their native language (Soviet with Cyrillic) with usually the correct unit abbreviation and then translated into English in parenthesis.!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Production Volume&amp;#10;300 boxed copies and 40 ziplock copies were produced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scenarios:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Main Campaign&amp;#10;    2 Small Scenarios (#1 Petsamo-Kirkenes '44 and #2 Kemi-Tornio '44 [FIN vs. GER])&amp;#10;    2 Special Scenarios (Tanne West and Tanne Ost '44)&amp;#10;    Special feature to link Vol. 2 with Vol. 3. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
