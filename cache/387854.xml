						               													<description>In &amp;quot;Barton in Bloom&amp;quot; players play the role of a member of an English village, all vying to become the most prestigious resident. They will do this by buying, planting, growing and harvesting plants, all so that they can help decorate the village cenotaph and have the best kept garden in time for the summer f&amp;ecirc;te.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a players turn they will use one of the shared worker dice to take one of the actions. This will increase the cost of that worker for all future actions. If actions are taken by the specialised worker they will take an enhanced action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rather than taking a normal action with a worker, a player may instead rest the worker gaining a benefit based on it's current cost and resetting it's cost back to 1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will continue taking turns until one player has completely filled their garden using flowers and ornaments. At this point the players' gardens will be judged against a set of judge cards played throughout the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
