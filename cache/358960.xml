						               													<description>Winds of Caribbean is a naval battle-themed game of sailing ships during the Age of Discovery, based on the system of the masterpiece Wings of War: Dawn of War. Players control sailboats, shoot cannons, and sometimes come alongside to fight and aim for victory.&amp;#10;The big difference between Wings of War and Winds of Caribbean is that the former has the same direction of movement and attack, while the later has different directions of movement and attack. The theory of naval battles during the age of sail was to face the enemy on the side where the cannons were lined up, and this game also reproduced that. You can experience a different battle from the air battle, such as how to switch between movement and attack. In addition, the cannon reflects the performance of the time, it requires loading of bullets for each attack and the rapid fire does not work, and if the ship moves violently, the hit rate will drop or it will not be possible to load. It also includes the element that if a fire breaks out due to being hit, the fire must be extinguished. When ships collide with each other, side-to-side battle (aboldage) also occurs. Some ships are better at this, so pirate style is also possible.&amp;#10;The feature of the component is that the display such as loading of bullets and decrease of hit rate is set to &amp;quot;character + lines&amp;quot;. It is also an expression that the commander's ability and command occupy a large weight in the naval battle at that time.&amp;#10;There are three types of ships: caravel, carrack, and small galleon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
