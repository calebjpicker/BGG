						               													<description>Word Capture needs speed and wit. This game for 2-6 player, and takes 10 minutes to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Word Capture players has to call an associated word following the calling condition. But be aware of calling with another player at the same time unless you might get a penalty point.&amp;#10;To set up, shuffle 40 subject cards playing with 2 to 3 players and 50 cards playing with 4 to 6 players and make a face-down deck on the middle of the table and turn the rest back to the box&amp;#10;When the game begins, one of the players turns the card over and puts it on the table so every player can see the Alphabet on the deck and the subject on the front of the card.&amp;#10;When there is a subject that matches the alphabet, every player has to call a word that is associated with the subject following the calling condition.&amp;#10;When this condition appears players must call a word matching the number of characters shown on the card.&amp;#10;When this condition appears players have to call the number of syllable word that matches with the number of orders they have to call. For example, the first player who calls must call a one-syllable word, and the second player must call a two-syllable word. When playing with 2player, this condition is fixed by calling a five-syllable word.&amp;#10;When this condition appears, the first letter of the word must include the letter that is shown on the card.&amp;#10;The last player who didn&amp;rsquo;t call an associated word or a player who didn&amp;rsquo;t follow the condition of calling has to take the subject card that is currently opened on the table as a penalty point.&amp;#10;And when 2 player calls an associated word at the same time they both get a penalty point by one taking from the front opened card and one from the deck.&amp;#10;When there is no alphabet matching with the subject, every player must place their hand on the card which is opened on the table. The last player who placed its hand on the card takes the card and gets a penalty point. If players made a mistake the first player who made the mistake takes the card.&amp;#10;The game ends immediately when there is one or less subject card left on the deck and the player with the less card on their front wins the game. In case of a tie, take 8 unused cards from the box and take extra rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
