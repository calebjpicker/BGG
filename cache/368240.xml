						               													<description>The game board consists of four pyramids broken down into individual small pyramids. At the beginning of the game, each player makes a throw and places his piece on the small square of one of the four pyramids that has the same number. This space, occupied at the beginning, forms the foundation stone of the pyramid to be built by the player and the number indicated on it shows the &amp;quot;base number&amp;quot;. The player who rolled the base number 1 is king or queen and begins. There can be multiple kings in the first game. However, if no 1 is thrown, the next lower number begins. Corresponding to the rolling, the game piece is then placed as many spaces further sideways as eyes have been thrown. When the end of a row is reached, the player moves on to the next higher row until he reaches the top of the pyramid. If a player throws his basic number, he is not allowed to move, but rather has to wait until it is his turn again. If the player rolls more points than he needs to fill the capstone, he must move back from the top of the pyramid by as many squares as he has rolled points too many. This is repeated until he manages to get to the keystone. The king or queen make an exception to this. These may occupy the capstone immediately as soon as they reach it or have rolled beyond it. Whoever is the first to finish building his pyramid receives the first prize and becomes king for the next game with the basic number 1. Whoever throws the basic number 1 in the next game must exchange it for 2, since the king number is then only one player may own. If several players finish in a round, the one who threw the lowest cornerstone at the beginning of the game has priority, i. h. started building the pyramid with 1 or the next lowest square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
