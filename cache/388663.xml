						               													<description>Road to Independence: The American Revolution, 1775-1783 is the first in a series of games simulating important conflicts in American history in a casual yet historically based manner. In this game, two players take the sides of the British and the Americans, vying for control over the Thirteen Colonies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Road to Independence not only includes the Eastern seaboard but also the conflict in the far Western territory, a theater not often covered in games on this conflict. Both players will fight for control of important locations using specially made dice that represent British and American regulars, Native American allies, militia units, and (for the Americans) French and Spanish forces. Each player also has their own deck of Event Cards that will allow special events and actions to occur, ensuring that no two games will play the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Will the Americans prevail and win their independence from the British Empire? Or will His Majesty&amp;rsquo;s forces bring the wayward colonies back under the Crown&amp;rsquo;s control? Find out in Road to Independence!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
