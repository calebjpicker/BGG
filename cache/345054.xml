						               													<description>The Last Gamble, Designer Signature Edition is Danny Parker's final effort to create a memorable game on the Battle of the Bulge. The scale is conventional: 2 miles per hex, battalions and regimental units; two turns per day. However, the game has many innovations never before seen. Day and night turns differ dramatically both with respect to movement and the likelihood of decisive combat. All units are rated for Morale which can often be more important than combat strength. Forced marches and fluid zones of control at night are a major German offensive weapon while the Allied air effort influences German movement. The game has many previously unseen influences: V-1 weapons attacks, weather impacts on combat (and even zones of control) and bridge discovery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As you would expect from a Danny Parker game the Order of Battle for both sides has been exhaustively researched (evaluated in a detailed numerical fashion) and several new units and many changes to others. Besides the new morale rules, armor superiority from the original has been retained although combined arms is enhanced and artillery influences are significantly changed. There are many changes to movement based on weather conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The map in the original game included all of the villages in the Ardennes. The new map now includes not only those villages but also all the hamlets and castles. A study of the 1940 census has resulted in some towns being downgraded to villages and some village upgraded to towns. The contour lines in the original game are now gone and severe terrain has been added based on detailed evaluation using Google Earth. The map has been expanded to include more area in both the north and south. There are three maps with one smaller one devoted to the Battle Before the Meuse scenario&amp;#10;The Game Booklet includes scenarios, Designer&amp;rsquo;s Notes, Game Variants, Examples of Play and the Game as History. Also included is a Historical Background Booklet with Historical Analysis and Summary, Detailed Orders of Battle, Evaluation of Combat Strengths in the Ardennes and Design Bibliography. With more detailed historical background than any game to ever see print, TLG will also be a great reference tool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More than just a reworking of the original game, this version is really a brand new game that has seen constant work for nearly five years by a dedicated team. The research on every aspect of the game has been truly monumental.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course there never will be a 'last word' in Bulge games, the subject is far too popular. But this game pushes the envelope far forward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
