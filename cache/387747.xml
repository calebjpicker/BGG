						               													<description>Village War: The Artefacts is a spinoff of Village War and is set in the same fantasy world based on Nigerian mythology. &amp;#10;There is a draw pile on the table, consisting of cards showing different artefacts with different abilities. The game lasts until the draw pile is gone. Whoever drew the last card, loses; of the others, the player with fewest cards in hand, wins. &amp;#10;On a turn, a player can play an artefact from their hand and use its power, discard a card, or draw a card. The artefacts' powers range from forcing others to draw cards, moving cards to other players, etc. The goal is to force someone else to draw the last card while having the least cards in yoyur hands yourself, but not all cards count the same at the end, so a bit of uncertainty remains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
