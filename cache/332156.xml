						               													<description>A historical fiction game set in the &amp;quot;age of sail.&amp;quot; As the captain of a small sailing ship, you sail into uncharted waters where strange things happen from time to time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- The game board shows a map of the archipelago with marked sea lanes, which players will use to move their ship between islands. At the top is a large weather panel, with a Beaufort scale, as the wind strongly affects ships and possible actions. Thanks to the mechanics of uncovering weather tiles, players have an accurate forecast for the next two days.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- In their turns, players can move their ships, fight with cannons or boarding, and perform a number of other actions, such as building facilities, buying or repairing ships, selling goods and valuables found on islands or at sea, and hiring captains, officers and sailors. Moving ships around the board is extremely simple, but good planning and the use of maximum speed can determine the outcome of the game, as sometimes, especially close to the finale, it is very important to get our ship in the right place at the right time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Immediately after landing on an island, the player discovers the exploration cards there, which describe adventures, encounters, events or objects. You can find both good things on them (such as pirate treasures) and not-so-good things (plagues, dark forces, strange creatures...). So it's better not to approach this task without having a full crew and with the right action cards in hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Although the Misty Waters are unexplored, the archipelago is nevertheless full of native life forms. Some of them are humans... Players will face all threats, but also other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- There are two trading posts with taverns on the islands. Here you can make profitable deals, gamble (inviting other players too!), meet &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; people, arrange risky tasks or missions for which you will need cargo holds, passenger cabins or.... cannons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player builds a deck of Action Cards, which in fact is a set of useful tools, such as weapons, additional sails, maps, tactics or experts that can help in difficult situations, significantly affecting the chances of victory. Since the number of Action Cards is limited - you need to choose them wisely, according to your preferred strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Since the game is designed for 1-4 players, and each player can command up to two ships (6 different types), spectacular sea battles are not uncommon on Misty Waters. (Especially when the Galleass of the conquistadors sails out of the harbor, fully loaded with gold and jewels, and everyone wants to get it.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- In addition to the players' ships, there are quite a few &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot; tokens on the board, such as pirate and conquistador ships, sea monsters, cannon batteries, rafts, and trapped chests in the sea vortex. You can also come across unique units, such as the Flying Dutchman.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- To win the game you must become the governor of the Misty Waters. You can achieve this either by: winning an election, conquering a certain number of islands, acquiring the legendary Conquistador Treasure. Often the fate of the game is weighed until the last minute.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Players can choose team play against other teams, solo play or solo mode.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
