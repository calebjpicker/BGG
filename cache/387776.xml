						               													<description>Players represent Interior Design companies which have been asked to fill rooms with furniture. &amp;#10;Each player has a floor plan of the rooms. On the table, there are sets of cards for each room, with each card showing one piece of furniture. Players take turns flipping over one of the cards and choosing one of the shapes shown on the backside of the card. Then all players have to draw that piece of furniture into their plan, making sure there is enough space for walls, doors and a corridor that connects the rooms. Also, each piece of furniture must be reachable from the door. To ensure this, the furniture shapes also show empty fields that must be adjacent to the furniture. To be able to fit all the furniture into the rooms, players must overlap the empty fields efficiently.&amp;#10;When all cards are flipped, players score depending on how much of the furniture they were able to place.&amp;#10;The scenario booklet contains several small campaigns with 25 scenarios all in all, with various difficulty levels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
