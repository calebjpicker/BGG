						               													<description>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dead Cat is a bluffing and push your luck game that can be played in under 10 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is family friendly, and the box is designed to be portable, so that it is light and convenient for one to carry it around, thus allowing games to be played during a train ride or on a plane.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are one of the assistants to Erwin Schrodinger, the famous physicist, who just entered the laboratory with a cat in one hand and a box in the other. After some fighting and hissing Schrodinger finally manages to put the cat into the box and to close it. Happy that the struggle is over he proudly announces that from now on no one is able to know if the cat is dead or alive as long as nobody looks into the box. Schrodinger orders you and your colleagues assistants to watch the box and take notes. An so you do for hours and hours&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, you have had enough. You turn towards your fellow colleagues, announcing that you will wager your position of first assistant to whoever is able to make the best guess on whether the cat is already dead and how long ago it died. Enthusiastically, everybody agrees, however you have a plan: to sneak into the laboratory at night and risk a peek into the box to make sure the most suitable candidate gets the title of first assistant. After all, who else would be more suitable than you?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dead Cat you try to guess how long the cat in the box is already dead. When it's your turn you have two options: you can either look into the box or you announce that the cat is dead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you decide to look into the box you take a card from the box deck, look at it without showing it to your opponent and put it on top of the time deck. After that you have to change your bet. Take the your betting die and change it to another site. You choose which one as long as it is not the same as before.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you decide to announce the death of the cat the round ends and you start revealing cards from the top of the time deck until you find a dead cat or there are no cards left. In the first case the player with the closest bet to the amount of revealed cards wins the round, in the latter case the player with the highest bet. In case of a tie both player receive a point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You play until one player gets 4 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
