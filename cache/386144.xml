						               													<description>Soar high upon your wings, like an eagle, as you seek to escape the clutches of king Minos. But beware, fly too high and the sun will melt the wax that holds your wings together... fly too low and the moisture from the sea will make the feathers too heavy to keep you aloft.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flight of Icarus is a fast-paced strategy game for 2-4 players in which you live out the classic Icarus myth. Build your wings, then brave the elements as you attempt to fly from Crete to the Greek mainland. During the first phase of the game you will collect wax and feathers using an action point system, managing these resources as you craft your wings. You may also play innovations to aid you during your flight. Then, you will take to the air, struggling against both the weather and your fellow fliers during the tactical phase of the game. Bid for the oracle's favor, that allows you to play weather cards and act first, as you jockey for position in the air.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An engaging mixture of strategic resource management and take-that mechanics, Flight of Icarus is fully language independent during play. Even should you fail in your flight, there is no player elimination, so you can still attempt to stop your competition from reaching the other shore.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
