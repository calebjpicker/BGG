						               													<description>This is a board-game-fox-chase, depicting huntsmen and dogs chasing a fox!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The publisher thinks this game will lift the gloom of a Winter's day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Fox is chased along the roads, from 'Going Out' in the left corner, and terminating on the right side, either in the death of the Fox or the 'Throwing Out' of the Huntsmen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Totum acts as the die. When spun, it will end on one of two letters; S for Scent, or F for Fault.If an S is spun, the fox moves to the first space on the board from Going Out bearing the letter S. And if F is spun, the fox moves to the first space upwards marked with an F. Players now follow, keeping to these rules. If in Scent, the fox always moves toward the direct road. If he is in Fault, he must be moved upwards and to the left to the next F space on the board. The Fox can only move along the roads. If he is in Fault and it is the next player's turn and he stays in Fault, he has to be moved backwards to the previous F, and so on until he reaches a road where he can move forward as long as he is in Scent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On arriving at Hope Turning, if the next player spins an S for Scent, that player wins the game by bringing the Fox to his death. But if that player spins an F for Fault, that player is thrown out of the game. The succeeding player now takes his chance on Hope Turning unless the former player, instead of being thrown out, decides to take the Fox to Agony Corner and pay 8 counters into the Pool for the privilege of another try. If he spins an S, the fox is again moved to the S at the end of Turn Off-Again Lane. If he spins an F he is again thrown out and the fox is put back on Hope Turning and the next player tries his luck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It would appear, but not clearly, that some spaces require putting counters into the Pool and some allow for counters to be removed from the Pool. If all the Huntsmen are thrown out, the Pool stays and another game must be started from the beginning. If a huntsman wins the game, he keeps the Pool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
