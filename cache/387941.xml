						               													<description>For 2 to 4 players, ages 7-107, Cowbell is an easy to learn, fast-paced card game made up of cow characters in four different scenes.  The object of the game is to be the first player to go out, but you can't go out without the Cowbell - and there's only ONE Cowbell Card in the deck.  You must have this card in order to play your last card and win the game, so everyone is trying to get their hands on the Cowbell Card and then go out of the game while they have it.  Players can steal the Cowbell from each other and the Cowbell can be rotated into or away from your hand depending on action cards played during a round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 57-card deck is made up of crazy cow characters like Cowabunga, Holy Cow, Cow Poke, Mad Cow and more!  Action cards include the Horseshoe Magnet, Don't Have a Cow, Cow Tippin', Milk It and Beef It Up - all with different actions that keep things mooooooooving right along!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Games can last anywhere from 2 minutes to 10 minutes - simply deal 7 cards to each player to start the game and take turns discarding matching scenes, characters, magnets or wild cards.  Get the Cowbell and try to go out before someone steals it from you.  If you don't have a play, draw until you do...it's sheer cow madness!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
