						               													<description>GAME ON is the very first live card game.&amp;#10;The Game is played while watching a sports event.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a special deck made for each sport:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Baseball&amp;#10;     Football&amp;#10;     Hockey&amp;#10;     Basketball&amp;#10;     Soccer&amp;#10;     Golf&amp;#10;     Tennis&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The two most popular ways of playing GAME ON&amp;hellip;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player (2-5 players) are dealt 7 random cards. Leave the leftover cards in a pile, they will be used soon.  Now.....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Let the sports event decide what cards to play by what is actually happening in the game. The goal is to dump all of your cards first. If the next play is running back running for 15+ yards and you have that card then you can play it. That is once less card you have to dump AND if that card you use is a + or - card then you get to dump more of your cards or have a player (or two) pick more cards up from the leftover pile. Its that simple.....AND FUN!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Play your cards by predicting what will happen next in the game. The goal is to collect as many cards as possible. Before the next chance (inning, possession, break, etc...) each player chooses a play from the hand they are dealt. Place it face up so everyone knows whos playing what. When the first person who chose correctly wins then he/she gets to collect all the cards that were played. Plus if his/her card was a +/- card then she could get more cards from the leftover pile or they can choose the cards that other players have to dump. Trade cards are used as well and when you win with that card you get to pick a players card (blindly) to trade with your worst card. Its that simple....AND FUN!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;***There are many other ways of playing GAME ON. Other luck games or harder games involving more skills and knowledge.***&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each sport has between 8-13 different plays in the deck. Some are rare but most are common plays.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
