						               													<description>Background:&amp;#10;War started in the year 2200, it was inevitable... metal combined with technology had turned into humanity&amp;rsquo;s worst enemy.&amp;#10;In the present day some cities still survive, protected by huge metallic walls, labyrinths and gates to prepare a first line of defense before any threats reach the inner parts of the city.&amp;#10;Build and pilot your Mech armor, it&amp;rsquo;s the only thing you can really trust to stay alive when venturing into the dangerous wasteland.&amp;#10;Money is worthless nowadays, but search the wasteland for scrap metal, cables, and electronics, you may even find weapons and lost tech from the Mech Wars. Whatever you find in the wasteland can be used to upgrade your weapons and armor, or as currency in the cities.&amp;#10;Pirates, mercenaries and psychos attack the cities in an attempt to conquer them, to loot and steal as much scrap metal and technology as possibly can.&amp;#10;Intro:&amp;#10;The Last Mechs is a cooperative exploration game for 1 to 4 players, a dungeon crawler set in a post-apocalyptic future. Includes a campaign mode that will guide you through the adventure with a comic book illustrated by David Daza. &amp;#10;Aside from the campaign, every hero will have their own short comic that narrates their personal stories, which you can unveil by searching for clues in the cities.&amp;#10;With highly detailed pre-assembled miniatures ready to play.&amp;#10;You can choose from 4 different heroes: Paul &amp;ldquo;The Legend&amp;rdquo; a former army man turned mercenary, Karl the mechanic with his D-Sherpa droid always by his side, Lorna and her large modified cargo Mech, and Gork the smuggler.&amp;#10;The Last Mechs includes some RPG elements, since the heroes attributes include Mech piloting, repairing, exploring, and communications, and they can learn new skills by spending experience points.&amp;#10;There are different phases in TLM:&amp;#10;A travel phase, when one of the heroes must guide the group while trying to avoid the grave dangers that plague the wasteland.&amp;#10;A search phase when you may look for scrap, electronics and cables (the most valued resources), or even find standard or lost tech weapons and armor that you can repair. Additionally, different adventures and events unrelated to the campaign may trigger during your journey.&amp;#10;By the end of the travel phase, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t reached a city, you must set camp on the dangerous wasteland and take shifts to guard the camp.&amp;#10;During the guard phase, the heroes will decide how to split the guard rounds and will solve events in the dark of the wasteland. Also, the mechanic can repair the Mechs and the droid can build ammunitions.&amp;#10;Your party will earn fame the longer you stay in the wasteland, which will give you benefits in the cities, but the danger levels will increase the longer you venture into the wasteland, making it harder for your team to survive.&amp;#10;The few cities that still stand have metallic labyrinths that protect them from enemies, which you must pass through to access the cities.&amp;#10;In the cities you will have access to: (depending on the city)&amp;#10;1- Canteen: Find clues about your story and rumors.&amp;#10;2- Doctor: Heal your heroes.&amp;#10;3- Mech garage: Repair and upgrade your Mechs and equipment.&amp;#10;4- Tattoo parlor: To get temporary boosts for your skills.&amp;#10;5-Supplies: Purchase weapons and ammo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kickstarter Prelaunch:&amp;#10;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/juegorama/last-mechs&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
