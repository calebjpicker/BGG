						               													<description>From the publisher's website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Momentum Football is truly unique in that it allows you to quickly play a full game in 15-20 minutes while yielding not only team stats, but also individual player stats. With Momentum Football you'll be able to track the following team and individual stats:Passing Attempts, Passing Completions, Total Passing yardage, Interceptions, Fumbles Lost, Sacks, Rushing Attempts, Rushing Yardage, and all scoring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Momentum Football uses a drive-by-drive approach to resolve games. But, don&amp;rsquo;t let the simplicity fool you. Over 254 variables are used to create each team&amp;rsquo;s chart making them highly accurate for both team performance and individual player performance. And best of all, we&amp;rsquo;ve designed the game so that there is little to no set-up time involved. As you become comfortable with the rules, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to grab two team sheets, a score sheet and four dice and begin play immediately.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Games are resolved drive-by-drive, rather than play-by-play. But, again, don&amp;rsquo;t let that fool you into thinking that individual contributions aren&amp;rsquo;t important. You&amp;rsquo;ll quickly see the impact of great rushers, passers and receivers on offense and pass rushers, cover men and big hitters on defense. So, while the game is resolved by drives, individual player contributions are the difference between winning and losing.&amp;#10;Don&amp;rsquo;t fret; special teams, penalties, turnovers, home field advantage, and a team&amp;rsquo;s momentum are all captured within the game. You&amp;rsquo;ll be amazed as you watch everything unfold on your tabletop just as it does in real life.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the name of the game implies, capturing the momentum as it swings from one team to the other is a big part of the game. Our system is unique in that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t overly dominate the game mechanics nor is it over stated. However, just as in real life, a team&amp;rsquo;s momentum can mean all of the difference between winning and losing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
