						               													<description>A fast paced, squad level miniatures wargame rich in tactical decision making. Take control of either the highly trained human forces, United Nations of Earth Commandos or the fearless machine forces comprised of G12 Nightmare robots and the dreaded Mark VII Assault Fiend. Various scenarios are included in the boxed set which you win by completing the mission objectives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Legions of Steel is played over a series of rounds each comprised of an Initiative Segment, 2 player turns and an end segment. At the beginning of each Round the players roll a d6, higher roller winning initiative. The player with the initiative decides who will have the first turn this round, themselves or their opponent. The person whose turn it is, is considered the active player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The active player activates each of their figures moving and attacking. Once a figure has been activated and its actions are finished, a marker is place next to that figure to indicate its state. If the figure attacked, a fired counter is placed next to it. If it did not fire, it is considered Covering which means that it is holding its attack for future use, including during the opponent's turn. Attacking at an opponent is accomplished through rolling a 6 sided die (sometimes more depending on the weapon and your tactical decision). There are various options for attacks including auto-firing, spreading your attack to multiple targets, hand to hand engagement and more that add to the tactical decision process. In addition, some figures have special abilities like Leadership or Extra Lives. With leadership a Sergeant figure can influence die results, allow troopers to move farther or command them to attack out of turn. The Mark VII Assault fiend has an extra life as it takes 2 hits to eliminate it from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The tactical decisions in this game are many with plenty of player interaction. You will be jockeying your forces for tactical advantage, trying to get the upper hand from round to round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
