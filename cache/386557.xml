						               													<description>Players are astronauts that have crash landed on an inhospitable planet called Atalix. A rescue shuttle is sent from your space station, but with difficult terrain and unpredictable storms near the crash site the closest the shuttle can land is several miles from the crash site. Unprepared for the harsh planetary conditions your team must gather resources and collect parts of their crashed ship in order to survive. Players are encouraged to write their own story as they make decisions about how to survive. The game presents players with real, impactful choices that change the course of the game including their objectives, strategies, and challenges as the game progresses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Escape from Atalix is a cooperative deck building game where players work together to survive and complete projects on the harsh surface of a distant planet. Each player manages their own deck of cards which they will use to move around the board, harvest resources, battle with hostile aliens, research the planets ecosystem, and upgrade capabilities with new cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards also represent energy, the more cards you have the more turns you can take before the ending the round forcing you to return to what's left of your ship. Each round that passes brings you closer to the brink of destruction. Researching the planet can help you upgrade your tools and increase your capabilities including the ability to retain cards between turns and add cards to your free play selection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
