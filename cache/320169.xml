						               													<description>Greetings, noble Castellan Ruler to Dicetroy the Castle. As a Castellan, you have many obligations to your family&amp;rsquo;s name - build castles, protect them, earn treasure, and deliver prosperity to your people. You do this by wisely utilizing the resources your subjects provide as well as waging war on your rivals and attacking their castle and accumulating the most treasure to be the mightiest Castlan Ruler of them all!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dicetroy the Castle is a dice rolling, matching, stacking, and smashing resource management and dexterity battle game for 2 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BASICS OF PLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player selects 1 Castelan Ruler player screen/backsplash and 20 dice of one color. To prepare for the CULTIVATE phase of each round players will set their screen in front of their battle zone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CULTIVATE&amp;#10;Flip the 90-second timer (you may choose to play &amp;ldquo;Peasant mode&amp;rdquo; and exclude the timer and have the Cultivate Phase be untimed).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From behind their Castellan screen, each player rolls all 20 of their six-sided dice at the same time then sorts, allocates, and places dice from dice that have at least one or more matching values. Unmatched dice and dice that you had no use for or dice that did not get placed before time runs out are returned to your dice pool or &amp;quot;Banished&amp;quot;. these are failed farmers and craftsmen who didn't deliver on their promised goods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PROSPER&amp;#10;Unveil your kingdom! Lift your Castellan screen and place it behind your castle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DECREE!&amp;#10;Certain Castellan abilities trigger and resolve. State these abilities to your Rival.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PROFIT! &amp;#10;Claim your treasure! Calculate how much treasure you earned and increase your Treasure die accordingly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WAGE WAR!&amp;#10;Determine which player will attack first by comparing the combined outcome of your Knight dice then alternate attacking each other until a player runs out of boulders or a player is raided making sure to clear all castle rubble in between attacks. After attacking has ended Fortify by either repositioning or clearing dice inside the Castle Zone, adding them back to your dice pool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When Fortifying all layers must be completed before continuing to build on a castle. All Dice but those remaining in the Castle zone and the Treasure die are returned to that player&amp;rsquo;s dice pool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For each completed layer of your Castle still standing after the war has ended, earn 1 Treasure. The first player to end a round with 20 Treasure is the lord of the land and the winner of the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THAT IS THE END OF THE AGE! (one round)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
