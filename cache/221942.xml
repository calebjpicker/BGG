						               													<description>Shhh&amp;hellip;it! is a cheerful and foolish card game that will cheer up countless evenings, as it has been doing in Italy for centuries! The game was indeed conceived in the Middle Ages by a group of aspiring artists. In those days, it was customary to throw excrements out the balcony to the square, once the work had ended. One day, an artist was hit by it and his friends slammed their hands on the table and called out &amp;ldquo;Shit!&amp;rdquo;. The unlucky artist decided to use it to develop a game that had immediate success since then.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First, two decks of cards are to be prepared. One of the two decks only include characters cards to be dealt to players, the other one includes all the other cards, representing the points, or so called tons of shit!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second deck has to be positioned at the center of the table so that it is possible for players to easily reach it with their hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game begins with the counter-clockwise cards dealing, 4 cards each player. Players must quickly choose one of the cards in their hand and pass it to the opponent to the right while picking up at the same time the card that the opponent to the left is handing over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player has a four of a kind (poker) hand must immediately pound the hand firmly on the center deck on the table, while shouting: Shit! All the other players must pound their hands on top of the one who pounded the deck first and called Shit!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last player pounding the deck has to draw a card from it, which value represents the &amp;ldquo;quantity&amp;rdquo; (tons) of Shit picked up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Watch out! The same rules applies if a player accidentally touches the central deck and subsequently has to draw a Shit! card right away. For this reason, it is possible to bluff by shouting Shit! or by pretending to pound the deck, in order to induce opponents to pound the deck too, by mistake, and therefore be forced to drawing the Shit! card. The winner is the Player summing up less &amp;ldquo;quantity&amp;rdquo; (tons) of Shit, once the cards central deck is depleted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
