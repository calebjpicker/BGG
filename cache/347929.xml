						               													<description>About a thousand years ago, somewhere in the world which is now called the middle east, two siblings started a new business: a delivery company called &amp;quot;Camel Express&amp;quot;. But how could they convince people to use their services? And which of the two siblings should lead the company?&amp;#10;They found an answer to both questions: The most successful one will be the &amp;quot;Boss&amp;quot;!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Camel Express!, two players compete against each other to prove who is the better businessperson and should be the boss. After the third new moon appeared, the player who manages to send the biggest Caravan on its journey is the winner of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can play this game in 3 different difficulties: Basic, Normal, and Advanced. We recommend starting with the Basic version and after just a few games and getting to know the rules, Play the Normal game. Do the same with the Normal game until you feel you are ready for some more challenges in the Advanced difficulty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Setup (Basic mode)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Lay down the 4 Caravanserai cards in front of the players&amp;#10;     Shuffle the New Moon card among the last 5 cards of the deck to form the Traders deck. &amp;#10;     Deal 6 cards to each player (from the top of the Traders deck)&amp;#10;     Each player gets a Meeple of her/his color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play&amp;#10;Beginning with the second player, both players must put their meeple on a Caravanserai of their choosing. The game plays in turns. In each turn, the player can do one of these four actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Place a card on one of Caravanserai&amp;#10;     Place a hidden card in front of himself/herself&amp;#10;     Draw cards&amp;#10;     Change Caravanserai&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of the Game&amp;#10;During the action of drawing cards, if any player draws the New Moon card, the first round immediately ends. The game plays in 3 rounds. After the first round is over, start the second and then the third round exactly the same as the first round. After the third round is finished, the player with the highest total point is the winner of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
