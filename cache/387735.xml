						               													<description>Magic Marbles is a strategy board game for 2-6 players who race  marbles around a track to the safety of their home. There is always the chance of landing on a magic spot leading to an encounter with the Generous Genie, Magic Carpet, Sinister Sultan or Fortunate Spell. Pickpockets and jugglers can sneak up &amp;ndash; best to be on the front foot and hone one's own pick pocket and juggling skills.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inspired by classic games such as Parcheesi, Ludo and Mensch &amp;Auml;rgere Dich Nicht, Magic Marbles is a modern game using themed function cards and a magic dice to inject excitement and game changing twists and turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is easy to learn. Each player receives a quick start reference card and playing cards themselves have functions printed on them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The unique felt board design is ideal for travelling. It rolls up into a compact bag: easy to store in any cupboard, caravan, suitcase or bag.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
