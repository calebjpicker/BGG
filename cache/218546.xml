						               													<description>This is a very large and unusually sophisticated electric football game that appears from the photos on the box and rules to date from the early to mid-1960s. It uses metal player pieces that are inserted into holes on the board both to set a hidden defensive formation and to run offensive plays.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Behind a cardboard shield, the defensive player places 11 men into his choice of the 29 holes on the defensive side of the playing surface. These are arranged in 7 lines: Deep Back (3), Back (5), Quarterback (3), Scrimmage (7), Beyond (3), Short Pass (5) and Long Pass (3).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The offensive player then decides both on the play and a risk factor (that adds to both gains and losses). He then inserts a man into appropriate holes, one at a time. A Backfield Run must start in a Fullback or Half-back hole, then either Deep Back or Scrimmage, then Beyond. A QB Sneak starts at the QB hole, then to Scrimmage, then to Beyond and to a Breakaway hole. For a pass, the QB starts in his own hole, then to Deep Back, and to any hole in either the Short or Long Pass lines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In essence, the offensive player is trying to guess where the defending players are and navigate a path through them. If there is no defensive player in the hole he uses, he carries on to a hole of his choice in the next line for the play; if there is, a red light goes on and the play ends, with the results coming up on an electric spinner and multiplied by the risk factor table. If he reaches the breakaway hole, a green light comes on, leading to a big gain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game thus enables the defense to be shaped for any situation, from guarding against a long pass to running a blitz by placing a defensive player in the QB hole and/or one or more Deep Back holes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are rules for tracking time, using time-outs, and penalties (for instance, when the offense uses an illegal sequence like QB - Scrimmage - Long Pass). The positions of the football and the 10-yard sticks are marked on a strip running along one side of the playing field.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
