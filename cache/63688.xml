						               													<description>From the Avalanche Press website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the spring and summer of 1916, American troops crossed into Mexico in pursuit of Francisco &amp;quot;Pancho&amp;quot; Villa, whose troops had sacked Columbus, New Mexico following a dispute with an arms dealer based there.  After several small clashes, the biggest battle of the campaign came not against Villa's Division del Norte, but another force also on Villa's trail: the Mexican Federal Army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just what happened at Carrizal in June 1916 is not clear: Mexican and American accounts vary wildly.  What is clear is that two dozen American cavalrymen were taken prisoner and up to 50 soldiers on both sides were killed including the &amp;quot;Hero of Carrizal,&amp;quot; the 29-year-old Mexican commander Gen. Felix Uresti Gomez. Only the looming war in Europe prevented open war between the two North American nations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Chihuahua Incident is a stand-alone game in the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series: You do not need any other game in the series to play any of the four scenarios. The game is designed as a preview of the Infantry Attacks system for our hard-core fans, the Gold Club members. It includes a handful of small scenarios taking place on one game board &amp;mdash; one based on the actual battle of Carrizal (or at least our reading of the different versions) with the others based on hypothetical variations that show the game system's take on infantry and cavalry battles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes the pre-release edition of the new series rules and charts, which may be altered before the release of the first boxed game, Infantry Attacks: August 1914.  The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor are the maps and rules printed. Instead it comes as a collection of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components. The game isn't for sale; it's free to all members of the Gold Club.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
