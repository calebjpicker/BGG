						               													<description>Every Christmas the whole family goes to Grandma's big house to celebrate. But this year Granny went to the Bahamas! Panic-buy your way to a happy holiday and invite relatives who have nowhere else to go - you have to show everyone in the family that you had the best Christmas!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take the role of families doing their last-minute Christmas shopping in order to lay on meals for guests on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, and buy and decorate a tree. The board consists of a number of shops; each shop has a separate queue, and each space in the queue offers a different reward - from food items to trees to decorations. On a player's turn they first move all of their limited number of pawns one space down the queues they're in, then choose to either start a new pawn at the top of a queue or retrieve a single pawn from a queue and take the item they've reached. The player must take exactly one of these two actions, meaning they have to carefully plan ahead to make sure they don't run out of pawns before they reach their goals, and don't end up with more than one pawn on a desired space in the same turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The task is complicated by the opportunity to bump other players' pawns around in queues or make trick telephone calls that distract your opponents from their shopping, and the juicy bonus points on offer for inviting various relatives to come and have dinner with you... so long as you don't offer anything they don't like!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ridiculous Last-Minute Christmas Shopping Family Brinkmanship is printable as a single A4 or US-Letter page, intended to be included in a Christmas Card; to play 4 coloured pawns, a pen or pencil and a piece of paper for each player are also required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
