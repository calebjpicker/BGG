						               													<description>From the Publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DICE Hockey features the use of individual player cards.  Players pass the puck around the ice using their own cards trying to work for a player shot or a goalie shot.  Players will pass, shoot, and defend just like they do on the ice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has their own passing column on their individual player card. This makes for a fast action hockey game where you will get exciting possession after possession without referring to a chart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Penalties, Face offs, Injuries, turnovers, special plays, and more are all included.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lineup cards will keep track of your current lines and making line changes is so quick and easy you will barely realize you are making one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A timing chart will help you keep track of when the period ends and the time remaining.  You will also get score sheets and team reference sheets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DICE Hockey also features a full career mode.  Lace them up as a skater or a goalie and start working on becoming a legend on the ice.  You start out as a border line player and as you accomplish certain tasks in a game you can earn points.  Spend those points on card upgrades.  The better you perform the more points you earn.  You will get over 100 blank player cards in your game and more will be available for free whenever you need them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DICE Hockey is available as both a print and play E-game or you can purchase the actual hard copy board game version.  The print and play game comes with the 2007-2008 season and you will get the 2008-2009 season as soon as it ends and I have it available.  If you want the printed copy, you get to select which of the two seasons you want to come with your game and you will get the other season emailed to you as a PDF.  Or for just a little more you can get the game with both seasons printed and mailed to you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
