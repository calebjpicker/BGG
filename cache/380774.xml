						               													<description>A version of the popular Apples to Apples game with pictures only. Great for young kids and families.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game play is the same as the original game where the judge reveals a green card and players each choose the most fitting red card from their hand to play that best matches the green card. The only difference is that you are trying to match pictures instead of words. The judge chooses the player whose card best fits the description given by the green card, and they get a point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: 168 cards quick play rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
