						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;Walk with Me&amp;rdquo; is a Scenario designed for two Survivors (either two players, or one player controlling a Survivor and an Ally).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the memorable The Walking Dead scene that serves as the inspiration featured Michonne and Andrea on a stealth mission to a downed helicopter while Woodbury rivals and Merle hunt them down, the scenario can be played with almost any two Survivors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Walk with Me&amp;rdquo; makes heavy use of Rivals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The event deck is now called Lay Low, during the campaign they were referred to as Walk with Me&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Clear&amp;quot; reunites Rick and Morgan in a battle of sanity while Michonne and Carl retrieve a memento.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this three-Survivor Scenario, you return to Rick&amp;rsquo;s hometown in search of supplies, trying to grab an important memento while you&amp;rsquo;re at it. When you arrive, you unexpectedly discover another remnant of the past waiting for you: Morgan, Rick&amp;rsquo;s first friend after the apocalypse, who now stalks the streets of the town consumed by madness, driving away Walkers and people alike.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In terms of gameplay, Morgan behaves a lot like a Rival. Each round, after the Survivors have taken their turns, Morgan performs a Reaction based on the Approach type of the Event selected by the Leader.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Normally, when faced with an enemy as dangerous as Morgan, the simplest answer in the cold, harsh world of The Walking Dead would be just to kill him. However, in this Scenario that course of action actually causes you to lose! Your goal is to SAVE Morgan, pulling him out of the dark pit into which he has fallen. If you can get through to him, there may be a way to bring back the good man that still lies buried in his heart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can save Morgan through Coordinate Actions. In &amp;ldquo;Clear,&amp;rdquo; whenever a Survivor near Morgan uses any Coordinate Action (whether it&amp;rsquo;s the standard Assist Action, or a Special Action like&amp;ldquo;Inspire&amp;rdquo; from Rick's &amp;ldquo;Born Leader&amp;rdquo; Survivor Card), there are two extra success effects he or she can choose from. The first lets the Survivor reveal the top card of the Clarity deck, and discard it if he or she wishes. This gives the Survivors a chance to either gain some insight into what Morgan will do next and adjust their plans accordingly, or to bypass something particularly dangerous altogether.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Clear Cards represent Morgan&amp;rsquo;s more lucid moments and are basically &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; cards when drawn from the Clarity deck, since&amp;mdash;unlike the Hostile Cards&amp;mdash;they have no instructions for Morgan to perform. While no Clear Cards start in the deck at first, more and more can be added over time, as Morgan begins to listen to reason. These cards not only help make Morgan more manageable during each cycle through the Clarity deck, but also happen to be the goal of the Scenario. While the Survivors won&amp;rsquo;t be able to bring Morgan completely back, once all five Clear Cards have been moved to the Clarity deck, Morgan will be well enough for the Survivors to leave him and head home.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contains:&amp;#10;- double sided map tile&amp;#10;- 20 event cards&amp;#10;- Morgan clarity deck&amp;#10;- Merle rival board&amp;#10;- rival board&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(from Kickstarter page)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
