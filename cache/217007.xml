						               													<description>Do you remember the movie of The Thing? That of the eighties, that of John Carpenter. You liked it, did not you? Well, look no further. If you want to relive the best moments of the film (if you suffer a horrible death you consider a good time), then The Creature is your game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Creature is a competitive card game in which you will all have to fight against all to escape with life from the scientific base in which you are locked together with an Being from Another World known as The Creature.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this hidden role-playing game you will not have friends, because anyone can be infected. The only thing that matters is to survive and to escape in the only available place of the rescue helicopter ... although that supposes to finish with your companions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Creature is a card game for 3 to 10 players in which no one is who they seem to be and where paranoia reigns throughout the game. Use your event cards to beat your teammates, vote against them to sedate them, collect weapons for the final showdown and try to prevent The Creature from taking over your body. Does it feel like little stress? Then wait for the helicopter to land and you have to fight everyone to occupy the only seat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game of The Creature lasts from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is not recommended for children under 13, we do not want children to become accustomed to crushing their friends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to escape from the research base on the helicopter. The bad thing is that there is only one place for a scientist, so only one of the players can escape the horror. Will it be a human who gets on the helicopter, one of the infected scientists or the creature itself?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The helicopter will arrive when all the turns of game are finished. There are as many turns in a game as participating players minus one, which are controlled in the time marker with the clock tab. The minimum number of turns to play is 2, and the maximum 10. This represents the difficulty or ease of the creature to infect scientists when the group is more or less numerous.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It can neutralize the Creature so that it does not continue to infect the scientists, sedating it twice (the first time the silk manages to escape).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scientist who escapes in the helicopter wins the game, even if it is the creature or one of the infected will mean the end of humanity ...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overview.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is divided into turns, and there are as many turns as players are present in the game minus one (maximum 10 turns), plus the final turn of the game, the helicopter phase where everyone fights against everyone to sit in the available seat and Escape from base. Each turn is divided into three phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Event Phase&amp;#10;     Voting phase&amp;#10;     Movement phase&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the events phase players put their event cards into action to produce effects during the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the voting phase players use their voting to decide which scientist they will sedate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The movement phase is played after the voting, and in it all players deliver their character cards (including that of The Creature) to the boss, who shuffles them and re-allocates them among the players, in such a way that the Creature moves from one scientist to another, infecting them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to escape in the helicopter. Players who have had the creature's card at some point become infected, and therefore will try to help the creature carry out its plans, complicating the existence of other players who are still human. The bad thing is that there will be moments during the game in which no one will know who is who, further sowing chaos in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
