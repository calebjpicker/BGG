						               													<description>A slightly new take on variable strength chits (more granular with up to 5 steps per unit vs. the usual three) covering more obscure battles of the Eastern Front. This is the first entry in a three part simulation of the failed Soviet offensive to eliminate the salient of the German Ninth Army during the winter of 1942-43 known as Operation Mars (25 Nov - 12 Dec 1942). Players will conduct operations as either Soviet Direction Commander Zhukov or the German commander of the Ninth Army, Model. Several possibilities existed given the terrain and the weather situation and some of these will be possible to explore with this game. Included are some hypothetical options that could have altered the outcome. This work is primarily based on Zhukov's Greatest Defeat by David Glantz with some OOB fleshing by Nafziger and maps based on post-war USGS surveys (which were themselves taken from wartime Soviet surveys).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each volume has one 22&amp;quot;x34&amp;quot; mapsheet (using 20mm hexes to be less cramped) with all three volumes able to link together covering 43&amp;quot; x 48&amp;quot; total area at 1.5 miles/hex and one day per turn.&amp;#10;Each game uses 0.6&amp;quot; counters of mainly German battalions and Soviet regiments or brigades - the first volume (Belyy) has 352 counters with two double-sided and three single-sided PAC accompanying a 18 page rule book, the second volume (Olenino) has 440 counters with three double-sided and two single-sided PAC accompanying a 20 page rule book, and the final volume (Konev) will have 528 counters with three double-sided and three single-sided PAC accompanying a 20 page rule book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Included scenario:&amp;#10;Belyy - Volume I - #1 Belyy Thrust - The included scenario provides the players a look at the attacks of Soviet 41st Army which managed the best gains of the operation. The goal of this scenario is to present players with a fluid breakthrough and timely reinforcements. Both sides hoping their command decisions will carry the day. Scenario Duration: Turns 1-10 (25 Nov - 4 Dec) on Map KS.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
