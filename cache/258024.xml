						               													<description>Extended Broadside is like a classic Battleships game on steroids. Instead of having two players placing their hidden fleets on a 10X10 grid, this one is played by four players on a huge (36&amp;quot; across) octagonal board in which each player has a five-sided slice of 160 numbered squares.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board, vertical dividers, posts and spacers are all of wood. The ships are gorgeous metal and wood miniatures, with carriers, battleships, cruisers and liners about 6&amp;quot; long, and destroyers and submarines about 4&amp;quot;. Each player gets two of the large ships and one of the small ones, and may place them either orthogonally (covering 5 and 4 spaces respectively) or diagonally (covering only 4 and 3 spaces).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player also has an island (same size as a destroyer), two minefields and an airplane. Before normal shooting starts, each player calls out the location of his island, and any island intersecting with any other player's ship(s) cause a grounding equal to a single hit, and the placing player gets a free additional shot. Then each player calls out the location of each one-space minefield: any ship on any of these squares is sunk instantly. These spaces are marked on all boards as hazards and are permanently blocked. Finally, each player gets a shot with a plane, which requires only one additional hit of any kind to sink a ship (an aerial hit on a grounded ship would sink it).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally the regular shooting begins. Each player calls out the number of a space, and hits any ship on that space on all other players' boards. A hit grants another shot. Once all spaces occupied by a ship are hit, it sinks and is removed from play. Players may also choose to use a more powerful air or mine attack, but lose their next one or two turns for doing so. Finally, unlike any traditional game of this type, this game allows a player to move a ship to a new location instead of shooting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game appears to have been hand-crafted, since the ships are all of slightly different sizes with a unique storage insert for each in the box. The only indication of a publisher is a coat of arms with a Greek motto on the wooden box. The use of a carrier with monoplanes suggests that it was made in the mid-1930s, shortly after the traditional Battleships game appeared under multiple titles including Broadside.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
