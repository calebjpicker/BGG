						               													<description>The extremely addicting and fun thing about games that push your luck is that one moment where you tell yourself this is the last card you will be taking... then you survive and you change your mind that you will be drawing just one more... and you still survive! And you promise that this next one would really be your last - and you survive yet again! Nothing beats that moment of suspense as you push your luck to the extreme, only to be rewarded by  glorious victory for your bravery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the light and casual game Queen of the Hill, players are queens vying for control of a celestial hill. Taking turns, they attempt to Gather, Form and Keep the strongest female warriors from different worlds and eras to join their army. However, this is a very dangerous act, and they cannot always control what they Gather. At the end of every round, players compare their total warrior scores Formed and the highest score wrests control of the hill. Control the hill twice and a player wins the game! Watch out though, the Dark One (also the only male in the game) might accidentally be Gathered and he will prey upon all the ladies. If you push your luck too hard, you might end up drawing him, and he will clear all your points and force you to end your gathering phase. How lucky are you feeling today? How far do you dare to push your luck? The more you push your luck without drawing the Dark One, the more likely the next opponent will attract him. And the more you push your luck, the more your foes are forced to push theirs if they are to beat you! The pressure is ON!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game when a female warrior is Gathered (drawn from the deck), a player has the option of Forming her into the current fighting group for that round and her Battle Points will be counted for the player's total score in that same round, or the player can choose to Keep her in his hand instead. If he Keeps her in his hand, she will not contribute any Battle Points to the player's score this round and be set aside for now. She does not go into the player's hand immediately. Only after the current round ends will all such Kept cards go to their players' hands, where they can now be played at critical moments to turn the tide against other players. An interesting thing to note is that Gathering is secretive. Other players will never know the actual total score of a player in a round (unless the Dark One wipes them out), but they will know the amount of cards drawn by the player so they can make a rough guess.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
