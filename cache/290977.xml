						               													<description>5 Different Boomtown Baseball Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Free! Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;disposable games to scratch, play &amp;amp; throw away&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECTIVE:  The Boomtown &amp;quot;Bats&amp;quot; are hosting their archrivals, The Mudville &amp;quot;Muggers&amp;quot;, in another classic confrontation at famous Boomtown Stadium!  It's the top of the ninth,  Neither team has scored.  Who will win this critical game?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PREPARATION:  Choose your team.  The teams bat with a lineup of four batters picked at random from their full team of nine.  A batter's lifetime &amp;quot;stats&amp;quot; are shown below his name.  The batting order starts at the top (near the pitch indicators) and is repeated if necessary by returning to #1 as the fifth batter.  Keep track of all base runner with pennies placed on the baseball diamond.  The &amp;quot;Muggers&amp;quot; bat first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY:  The pitcher throws each ball by placing his finger tip on the pitch of his choice and announcing either &amp;quot;fast ball&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;curve ball&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;slider&amp;quot;.  The other player then scratches any one of his four &amp;quot;swing&amp;quot; boxes&amp;quot; under the pitch for the player he has at bat (if all a batter's swing boxes are scratched for one type of pitch, the pitcher must throw something else). It will reveal one of the following results:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HR (Home Run)  - It's a hit out of the park.  The batter and all runners score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;X (Strike) - Get 3 strikes and the batter is out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;W (Walk) - The batter advances to first base.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;G (Grounder) - It's a hit.  The pitching team must play the ball.  The pitcher scratches any one of his ten &amp;quot;Infield&amp;quot; squares to see the results of the play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FB (Fly Ball) - It's a  hit.  The pitching team must play the ball.  The pitcher scratches any one his ten &amp;quot;Outfield&amp;quot; squares to see the results of the play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When and Grounder or Fly Ball is played by the pitcher the following things can result:&amp;#10;S (Single) - The batter and all runners advance one base.&amp;#10;D (Double) - The batter and all runners advance two bases.&amp;#10;T (Triple) - The batter and all runners advance three bases.&amp;#10;HR (Home Run) - The batter and all runners score.&amp;#10;O (Out) - The batter is out.&amp;#10;DP (Double Play) - The batter and the furthest advanced runner (if there is one) are out.  Scratch two out squares on the scoreboard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Keep track of &amp;quot;Runs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Outs&amp;quot; by scratching the squares left to right on the score board.  After the &amp;quot;Muggers&amp;quot; have made three outs, the roles reverse and the &amp;quot;Bats&amp;quot; come up to the plate.  After the &amp;quot;Bats&amp;quot; have three outs, the game is over.  The team with the highest score wins.  In the event of a tie, play another card for &amp;quot;extra innings&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SPECIAL HINT:  You will notice, after playing a few games, that each of the nine batters on each team always bats exactly the same way every time.  For example, Homer Bundy, the slugger Right Fielder for the &amp;quot;Muggers&amp;quot;, always hits a home run if you pitch him a fast ball.  The more you know about each batter, the better you can pick the right pitch or choose the right swing.  Fast ball pitches tent to either be hit hard or get a strike.  Sliders tend to produce grounders, and curve balls tend to produce a lot of fly balls and walks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
