						               													<description>In this game players create chemical companies in order to devellop as much products as possible. During the game, the players are confronted with economical, chemical and technical questions. &amp;#10;Products can be created within one of the four categories: specialties, energy, consumer products of pharmaceuticals.  Through research, design, and pilot phase a final product is created and victory points are gained. &amp;#10;But the competition can be hard and they can make it difficult for the player to make a return on his investment for the products he's creating. The winner is the player who dominates the world's economy by creating the most products and gaining the most victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game was created as an educational game by Identity Games International bv in collaboration with students from the Technical University of Delft (T.U.Delft) in The Netherlands and with sponsorship from multiple chemical companies.  On release, a free copy was sent to almost 1000 schools in The Netherlands and Belgium.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play :&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players throw the dice to move around the board. There are different types of spaces they can land on :&amp;#10;- Products: the player can invest in the product or go to the next stage of development, paying the fee. If another player has already invested in this product, the current player can pay him royalties or go for a hostile take-over to become the market leader.&amp;#10;- Chance : the player takes a chance-card and may get or lose money.&amp;#10;- Strategy : these cards give the players an advantage (hostile take-over, protection, Nobel-prize, investment bonus or grants).&amp;#10;- Start : each time the player passes start, he's paid a salary.&amp;#10;- Artesia (bank where the player gets money),  OCenW (player gets an education and passes this round) or InterChem2000group (the dice are thrown again and the player moves further on the board).&amp;#10;Players obtain victory points for each fully developed product (phase 4), for each market they dominate and if they win a Nobel-prize.&amp;#10;The winner is the player who manages to first gain the predetermined number of victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
