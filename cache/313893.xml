						               													<description>The Riot Quest chaos continues with the new Wintertime Wasteland starter box! After plundering and looting all they could find in the more civilized corners of the Iron Kingdoms, the heroes (and villains) of Riot Quest are headed to the strange, frozen north in search of more treasure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This starter is fully compatible with all previous Riot Quest releases and kicks off a brand new block of post-apocalyptic, winter-themed models and expansions for the game. Wintertime Wasteland introduces new Arena maps, new Bounty and Treasure decks, and loads of new beautifully sculpted Hero models.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Wintertime Wasteland also introduces exciting new game mechanics, like ultra-powerful Legendary Riot Gear and Tag-Team Heroes (that's two Heroes combining their efforts to work as single game piece in your Crew).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to Riot Quest, Wintertime Wasteland is a perfect starting point to take the icy plunge into the loot-questing lifestyle. And if you&amp;rsquo;re a veteran scavenger with a seasoned Crew, Wintertime Wasteland is ripe with new blood to add to your Bench.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So, get your fightin&amp;rsquo; pants on! It&amp;rsquo;s time to gear up, wreck face, and get paid!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Riot Quest, players assemble a crew of 5&amp;ndash;10 Heroes and an equal number of Riot Gear cards to compete with up to three other players in a chaotic battle to score treasure and rack up victory points in an Arena.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, players alternate taking turns by activating one of their Heroes to perform various actions, such as running around the Arena, attacking Enemies, or raiding Treasure Chests. A player has a limited pool of Action Dice to spend each round, with at least one die being spent for each action a Hero performs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the game, Treasure Chests will randomly appear around the Arena, which a Hero can raid to gain valuable Loot. Loot is spent to purchase the Riot Gear a player selected at the beginning of the game. This Riot Gear upgrades that player&amp;rsquo;s Heroes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bounty cards represent the goals each player is attempting to achieve in order to score Victory Points and ultimately win the game. These Bounty cards might require a player&amp;rsquo;s Hero to do a certain amount of damage to an Enemy during their turn, to interact with a specific token that was put into play by the Bounty card via a rig action, or any number of other possible goals. Every time a player meets the goals of a Bounty card, that player claims that card and its associated Victory Point value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Claiming Bounty cards isn&amp;rsquo;t the only way a player can score Victory Points. By attacking and knocking out Enemies, a player can claim Scrap cards, which are also worth Victory Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As Treasure Chests are raided, Bounty cards are claimed, and Heroes are knocked out, they are constantly being replaced at the start of each turn. This means the Arena is a dynamic battlefield with constantly evolving conditions and situations. To achieve victory in Riot Quest, a player needs the right tools at the right time, the cunning and foresight to react to the chaos of the Arena, and a little bit of luck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from kickstarter page&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
