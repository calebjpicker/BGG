						               													<description>Trail, copyright 1903 and 1904, is a card game where two to eight players represent hunters chasing a fox. There are 53 cards: four suits of 13 hounds (numbered 1 to 13 with a corresponding number of dog heads in circles) plus a single card with a red fox.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The red hounds are the trump suit. The fox is a red suit card, and beats any other red except the 10, 11, 12 or 13.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players cut for deal, and the dealer passes out a number of cards based on the number of players, from 20 for two players to 6 when there are eight. After the deal, the rest of the deck is placed face down on the table and is known as the reserve pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player to the left of the dealer plays a first card, which becomes the Trail card. Each other player must play a card of the same suit if possible, or any other card if he has none. The trick is taken by the highest card in the Trail suit unless overtaken by any red card, in which case the highest value red takes the trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner of the trick must discard one card from his hand and replace it with the one on top of the reserve pile. Once the reserve pile runs out, play continues until all cards in the hands have been exhausted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All cards of 10 or higher in the trick, as well as all red cards, are placed in the &amp;quot;kennel&amp;quot; in front of the player and count for points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player holding the fox may play it at any time except as a Trail card. If the fox (which beats anything but 10-13 of red) wins the trick, that player gets five bonus points. If another player takes the trick with the fox by playing a high red, that players gets five points. If the Trail card is a red 10+, the fox must be played if held.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fox is &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; in the final count. Whichever player has the largest number of red hounds in his kennel (each card counting its number, i.e. the red 10 counts as 10 hounds, the red three as three) gets 10 points for catching the fox.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player then gets 4 points for each #13 card held, 3 for each #12, 2 for each #11 and 1 for each #10. This provides a maximum number of points available in a round as 55. This also is the number of points required to win the game, so a game usually consists of two or more rounds. &amp;#10; The box also includes rules for six other games using the same cards: Chase, Dogon, Red Heads, Numbers, Word Building, and Finding a Sweetheart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
