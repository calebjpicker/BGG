						               													<description>Destini Productions presents the first collector card/game to bridge the gap between Fantasy Art collectors, Literary Enthusiasts and Gamers.  All this in one product called, &amp;quot;Flights of Fantasy&amp;quot;.  The core set will consist of 90 cards divided into three subsets: Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror.  Each subset of 30 cards will bring forth an intense story line on the backs of these cards.  Corresponding with the storyline will be a specially designed game concept never before seen in this format.  All the art work for the core set of 90 cards has been exclusively produced by internationally known Game Illustrator, Ed Beard, Jr.  Ed began this May of 1992.  All work on the 90 card core set has been painstakingly created to the exact specifications of the storyline.  This is the first and only &amp;quot;Flights of Fantasy&amp;quot; Collector card set and Game of its kind.  March 1992&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This never before seen concept will appeal to the traditional role playing gamer due to the highly realistic and detailed fantasy art work, as well as the graphic novel like backs to the cards.  In addition the game has a fresh new approach that allows the player to engage in a quick and fierce battle based on the storyline concept.  There are a variety of alternative ways to play depending on which you prefer.  Uniquely designed random elements decide the games fate to assure fair play.  Destini Productions is most proud to be able to guarantee that in each box of &amp;quot;Flights of Fantasy&amp;quot; the customer is rewarded with not one, not two but three complete core sets.  We have gone to great extremes to collate this product this way for an affordable product.  That means three different game themes times three complete sets, all for the price of a traditional fantasy card set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- From the &amp;quot;Flights of Fantasy&amp;quot; promo sheet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set contents:&amp;#10;30 Fantasy themed cards (numbered 1-30)&amp;#10;30 Horror themed cards (numbered 1-30)&amp;#10;30 Science Fiction themed cards (numbered 1-30)&amp;#10;2 Checklist cards&amp;#10;3 Rules cards&amp;#10;10 Puzzle cards (9 puzzle pieces and 1 overview card)&amp;#10;12 Gallery cards&amp;#10;3 special insert cards (1 bonus Rule card and 2 signed Gallery cards)&amp;#10;7 promo cards (5 bonus Rule cards and 2 promotional cards)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An unnamed expansion set, bolstering the character roster and adding official multiplayer support alongside more supplemental rules, was planned but never published.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
