						               													<description>Syndicate Ultimatum is set in the cyberpunk world of the future. The world is under control of the World Syndicate, in whose hands all power is concentrated. But there are Corporation Cities that are not subject to him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In one of those cities - Helios - one of two players take on role of Stella - daughter of deceased head of the city, and other player become Roy - successor of Stella's father. Remember: Helios can only have one ruler! Who will become it? Players only have 24 hours to determine this...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The struggle take place in five districts of the city. The goal of each player is to take control of more districts than his opponent. The game consists of two rounds, according to the results of which the winner is determined.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players in their turns place tokens from their player boards in an attempt to earn as many Victory Points (VP) as possible. Each type of tokens(there are five of them in the game) has its own abilities and its own strength. A district is considered to be under control of player if total power of his tokens in it is greater than that of the opponent. Each controlled district in the round end is worth one VP to player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But not everything is so simple. The game has 25 unique district cards that allow players to make changes on the struggle field. When player playing a card from his hand, he applies its ability and then places it on the Timer represent the hour counter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as the twelfth card is placed on Timer, the round ends. The game ends after second round ends. Player with most VP is winner, in case of a tie both players are loosers, and Syndicate is enslave Helios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has an asymmetry module represented by four special Boss ability cards &amp;mdash; the main tokens of players. Placing the Boss token on an district, the player applies its ability, which can frustrate all the opponent's plans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can also be played in tournament mode. In this case, players do not receive points for each controlled area. Instead, player receives one victory point if he wins the round. The game lasts up to two wins of one of the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
