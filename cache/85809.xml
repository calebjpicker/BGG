						               													<description>Urban-Ops: the cardgame sees two squads of soldiers/mercenaries fighting in an urban environment (namely, an industrial city called Horizon) , using all sorts of equipment (from sniper rifles, to short barrel shotguns; from GPS to jetpacks; from assault rifles, to medical kits, and so on) to try to win the fight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has a very simple mechanic: after the players have chosen their squad (made of 6 different character, picked from the character pile, each with a specific background, image and abilities), they randomly place the locations (represented by cards) in which the fight takes place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then draw equipment cards, and, one at time, each player can perform, during his turn, the following actions:&amp;#10;1. draw up to 2 arsenal/equipment cards&amp;#10;2. equip up to 2 arsenal cards to the characters&amp;#10;3. move a character from a location to another&amp;#10;4. activate a character to use an equipped item&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once equipped, a card is used by rolling one D10: if the player rolls higher than the activation number (written on the equipment card), the item is successfully used, and players deal with its effects; otherwise, the card has no effect, and is discarded.&amp;#10;As simple as that.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But to give the game morespice, locations and character abilities give die roll modifications, so, for example, if you need to roll a 5+ to successfully use a rifle, but your character sucks at using ranged weapons, your roll will have  a -1 modifier, so you'll need 6+.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Modifiers will stack, so a bonus given by the character will add up to any bonuses or detractions given by locations, and vice-versa.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As if this was not enough, hidden among the arsenal cards, there are event cards, that, when drawn, make an event happen (from earthquakes, which will destroy a location, to spies, that will make one of your characters change faction; from swarm attacks, that will make characters loose their equipment, to the arrival of mercenaries that will add a new character to the opposing squad). These events are actually thought to discourage players from continually drawing arsenal cards, and to randomize things around.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
