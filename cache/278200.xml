						               													<description>Pathogen is a game about conquering cells. You're in control of a mutating virus spore. Your aim is to multiply your Virus, Infect nearby Cells, and Invade the opposition. It's a battle of the strongest virus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 2 Win Conditions. First Player to control 8 Cells wins the game, or the first player to invade and infect the opponents Home Cell wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cells are arranged face down randomly, there are 12 in total, and each cell has Resilience and Energy, as well as a unique ability. Resilience is the health of the cell, and Energy is how much energy it produces once you capture it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some cells are controlled by Grey Parasites, they are like a neutral enemy, players must defeat before capturing that cell.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player has several Active Actions as well as Passive Actions.&amp;#10;Each player can perform 2 Active Actions, but can never Move the same Virus die twice. Once a player controls 3 Cells then he gains 1 additional Active Action.&amp;#10;Passive Actions are situational, and happen at different phases of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Active Actions&amp;#10;Multiply, Split, Move, Invade, Infect, Pass.&amp;#10;Passive Actions&amp;#10;Grow Virus, Collect Energy, Upkeep, Scout, Grow Spore, Draw Mutation Card, Mutate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Movement is done between Cells in a diagonal fashion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can also earn Mutation Cards &amp;#10;There are 2 types of Mutations, Active, and Passive. Passive mutations are played face up, and they give you an ongoing bonus. Active mutations are played face down, and are 1 time use mutations. Mutation card can be purchaded, but they are expensive, at 10 energy. Mutation Achievements are as follow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Expansion: Draw Mutation Card when you control your third cell.&amp;#10;     Central Advancement: Draw Mutation Card when you control a Central Cell.&amp;#10;     Turtle Power!: Draw Mutation Card when you Grow 5 Spores.&amp;#10;     Exponential Army: Draw Mutation Card when you Have 5 Virus Dice with 6 in one Cell.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game is a frantic race to control cells, grow and multiply your virus army, and defeat your opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
