						               													<description>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two fighters enter the ring, but only one can emerge victorious! Do you have the stamina, speed and strength to be the victor!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A boxing themed card game for 2 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup: &amp;#10;Divide the cards into five decks: Fighters, and the four Skills decks - Punch, Dodge, Counter and Cross.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle the Fighter deck and give each player two Fighter cards. Players choose one card and place it face up and one card on top of it face down. Use the corner of the face down card to mark the starting stamina of 10 on the face up fighter. Note - each fighter has a unique set of skills and a favored hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Separately shuffle each of the Skill decks and deal a number of cards to each player as listed under &amp;lsquo;Skills&amp;rsquo; for the Fighter&amp;rsquo;s card setting any extra cards aside.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then, shuffle all Skill cards previously set aside and deal one to each player. Any remaining cards are removed from the game. &amp;#10;Both players now have a deck of 21 Skill cards. Each player will look at their cards and choose 11 cards to take in hand for the first round. The other 10 cards will be used in the second round and are set aside.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Types of Skill Cards: &amp;#10;Punch cards are attack cards and deal damage, reducing a player&amp;rsquo;s stamina.&amp;#10;Dodge cards are defense cards, reducing stamina damage.&amp;#10;Counter cards are defense cards, reducing stamina damage from the other player and then immediately become attack cards and deal stamina damage to the other player.&amp;#10;Cross cards are attack cards and deal stamina damage, and then give a bonus attack value if the next card played by the player is a Punch card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play: &amp;#10;Players will simultaneously choose a card from their hand, placing it face down in front of them. Both players will then reveal their cards at the same time and place them face up in front of them in a row. Players then assess who will take stamina damage based on the two cards just played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After 10 cards are played in the first round, both players will place their 11th card in front of them and add the number in the upper right of the card to the current stamina on their Fighter card. This is the only time stamina is added to a player&amp;rsquo;s total.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both players will then take the remaining 10 cards into their hand and fight a second round. If at any point, during any round, a player&amp;rsquo;s stamina is reduced to zero that player is knocked out and the other player wins. The player with the higher stamina after two rounds is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If, after two rounds, players have the same stamina value, each player will choose 10 cards from their deck of 21 and will compete in a third and final round. If players are still tied after a third round, the match is a draw.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
