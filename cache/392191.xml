						               													<description>Kess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game where players move their pieces around the board trying to capture each other's pieces. Players take turns moving five spaces (using one or more of their pieces) trying to surround the opponent's pieces on three side to remove them from the board. Claim victory once your opponent has only two pieces left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Strategic enough for skilled players, but easy enough for children, Kess can be taught in three minutes and played in twenty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
