						               													<description>A new neighborhood has been built and the people who live there don't know each other. A neon party is organized to get to know each other. You also live in this neighborhood. If you decorate your house with as many lights as possible, you will make a good impression. Do you know after the neon party who lives on who on which house number lives? Then you have a big chance of winning the neon party game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player tries to get many points as possible on his house number. The players don't know each other's house number. There are 2 sets of house numbers cards 1-5. One of them are placed in the middle of the table. Each player receives a secret housenumber from the other set of 1-5.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rest of the cards consist cards with numbers -5 (defect neon lights) to 5(working neon lights) and a few special cards. These cards form the draw pile. If it is a players turn, he will take a card from the draw pile. He can place this card on both sides of a house number. Then it's the next players turn and he does the same. If there is a total of 5 cards on both sides of a house number, there is a scoring. &amp;#10;First, it is determined which side of this house number has the most cards. The side with the most cards will be placed on table below the house number card. For the order house numbers, the same side will be placed below the house number card. The entire other side of the house numbers with cards will be placed on the discard pile. After this, there are no more neon light cards on table (except below the house numbers and the discard pile). Then the game continues. If there are 5 cards placed at a house number another scoring takes place. The game ends when the draw pile is used up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 2 special cards with which you can remove cards and do 2 turns in a row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players then guess from each other which house number they have. Each correctly guessed house number earns 5 points. If someone is well guessed by all persons, he is out of the game and therefore does not participate in the final scoring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everyone counts the points on the cards under their house number. The player with the most points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
