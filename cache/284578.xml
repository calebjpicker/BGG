						               													<description>This is a skirmish game for two small forces, each consisting of 1 to 4 sub-units, each in turn of 4 to 12 singly based 25mm figures, totalling up to 24 army points (AP) and controlled by a single player. Figures vary in cost between 6 AP and 2 AP. One figure of the most expensive mounted type or most expensive foot type present is nominated as the force's commander and one figure of each group is nominated as its leader.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Current skirmish rules split play into very small increments and use simultaneous movement requiring written orders. We split play into alternate bounds, each of which simulates the time needed by a warrior to observe, appreciate his situation, decide if he needs to continue a current action or to do something different and then do it, or to exchange blows with or shoot at an opponent. This is about 5 seconds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As all men are not similarly quick thinking or quick to react, we randomly limit the number of figures that can shoot or be moved each bound, but not the exchange of blows by figures already in physical contact. Since complex group actions require orders that cannot be passed and obeyed in 5 seconds, they are made more difficult to achieve and are assumed to have been initiated during the previous bounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We distinguish between fatal and disabling wounds, but do not take account of wounds unlikely to affect combat in the short term, or distinguish the fates of men from those of their mounts. The winning side recovers its disabled. Those of the losers are assumed to be slain in the pursuit, except for knights who are ransomed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Despite its simplicity, the resulting system is much more subtle than may be immediately apparent. The average player has memorised the battle rules part way through his first game, but tactical skill takes longer to develop. A game usually lasts less than an hour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
