						               													<description>Battleground Brawl is a tabletop, platform fighting game that pits fighters (players) against each other in an attempt to either deplete the opponents health, or knock them off of the play area, in order to score points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The play area consists of a board with a grid. This grid is the guide for where platforms and players can be placed. To set up the game, players agree on the placement of the platform pieces and then choose where to place their fighters. For round 1, the player with the lowest health starts, and each subsequent round the &amp;quot;first player&amp;quot; moves clockwise. Each round, players must first take it in turns, going clockwise from the &amp;quot;first player&amp;quot;, to move their fighters according to their movement field. If a player moves adjacent to another player, then that player is not allowed to move in this turn, as they are deemed to be engaged in battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all players that can move, have moved, then the combat phase begins. Each player plays a card face-down from their hand and chooses a target opponent. A hand consists of 5 cards drawn from that players deck. A deck consists of a number of cards available to each fighter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once every player has played a card face down and declared a target, flip the cards and resolve them in the same order as movement in that round. Some cards may be played out of order, as a reaction to other cards, for example: If Player 1 targets Player 4 with an attack card, but Player 4 played a dodge card, then Player 4 resolves this action before Players 2 and 3. If Player 2 (and/or 3) also targeted Player 4, they target that players previous location and therefore Player 4 dodges all attacks simultaneously, they do not target the new location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all actions have been resolved and health deducted/added where appropriate, the &amp;quot;first player&amp;quot; switches clockwise and the next round begins. Discard previously played cards and draw your hand back up to 5 cards. Declare your movement (if applicable), then your targets, then play your next card, and repeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
