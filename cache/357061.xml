						               													<description>Having perfected the martial art of Kyudo that allows an archer to fire their bows with uncanny accuracy, Shiho Shota has become a legend in his own time. He even managed to fire an arrow throw the circular centre of a silvermoon that was thrown high in the air while blindfolded! But Shiho Shota is far more than trick-shots and showing off for the crowd; he has dedicated his entire life to mastering the bow, so much so that it is not an instrument in his hands but an extension of his body and fierce fighting spirit. The years have been hard on Shiho Shota, always hunted and on the run from the Dragon usurper, but such is his resolve; he has never let this wear him down. It has only doubled his will to fight now that the Black Eagle has flown home!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you wish to run a Shiho warband with a ranged element, Shota is the perfect addition. He can reliably shoot anything. While his ordinary Dai Kyu shots are excellent, his ability to ignore LoS (Line of Sight) while shooting pushes him to the next level! However, the cost of an additional reload marker makes this a complex trade-off. His melee ability is average for Shiho Samurai, but he can benefit from an Enhancement Equipment weapon card. His melee ability is good enough to finish off the enemy models he has already damaged with his bow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blister contains one miniature supplied with a 30mm base and full colour profile card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
