						               													<description>&amp;quot;Rainbow ore is a legendary mineral that is more beautiful than any mineral. Many alchemists are trying to figure out how to make Rainbow ore from different minerals. Every day these alchemists have to find the necessary ore. But finding the required ore is not an easy task. They may have to rely on some luck sometimes. Sometimes it may be ore, But sometimes it might get a stone.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prime Stone is an educational board game designed for classroom use. The game rules are simple enough to develop calculating skills, which are a necessary basis for learning mathematics at a higher level. The prime Stone game can be used to educate about integer factorization and review content such as the greatest common divisor and least common multiple, prime numbers, composite numbers, powers, and other related topics. Teachers can use it to schedule classroom activities and play outside of school hours. Parents can play with their children to help them improve their math skills.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can choose to do one of three things: Pick, Mix and Build. Details are as follows: 1) Take two tiles from the bag and place them in front of the player. If the player picks up one stone tile, the player places the picked tile in front and puts the stone tile back into the bag. 2) Combine two or three tiles placed in front of the player using Multiply and put the old and new tiles back into the bag. 3) Create Rainbow ore from the target card. Using two or three tiles placed in front of the player multiplies any number of the target cards. Players can use those two or three tiles to create rainbow ore by having the player put the tile used to create it back into the bag. Then put the target card in front of the player and put the number of stone tiles specified in the target card into another player's bag. (will give stone tiles all with one player or distributed to multiple other players) and then open a new target card to replace it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two conditions to ending the game, either 1) the player generates eight rainbow ore or 2) the player collects four target cards. When one of the players meets the condition, play that round as the last round and count rainbow ore number. The player with the most number of rainbow ore is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
