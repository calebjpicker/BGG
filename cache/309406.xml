						               													<description>January 1919. Poland returned to the map of Europe only two months earlier. Now the Republic desperately needs reforms which can be carried out only by Sejm. Even though the country doesn't even have its borders set up, the Chief of State calls for democratic election which will allow to choose the Representatives of the whole society. It's time for the first election campaign of the Second Polish Republic!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Wybory 1919&amp;quot; is a dynamic boardgame in which the players are the leaders of four main political forces in the interwar Poland. They try to lead their parties to victory in the upcoming elections. By playing action cards, they compete for support in four main social groups: peasantry, city dwellers, workers and the minorities. They can increase their own popularity and place a supporter meeple in their color in one of the groups, decrease others' support, manipulate the regional elections' order or even cancel elections in some constituencies by calling in the military actions in the region. Each player gets an identical deck of 9 action cards at the start of the game, but draws up to the limit of three cards at random in their turn - reshuffling the discard pile if the draw pile runs out. Players need to strategize based on their current hand and pay attention to the cards that their opponents have already used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whoever gets the majority in each of the three groups favoured in the current round's constituency, wins the seat for their representative in that round of elections. The party that gets more representatives than any of the others after the last round is resolved, wins the game and assists in writing the Second Polish Republic's history!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was commissioned by the Social Communication Bureau at Chancellery of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland for the 100th anniversary of the first elections in Second Polish Republic. It's meant as an educational tool in teaching history and promotional item for the Sejm. As such, it hasn't been available in retail. The instructions booklet contains more detailed historical background on the elections of 1919-1920 in Poland. The action cards provide some basic information on the leaders of each political side as well as flavor texts in the form of newspaper quotes from that time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
