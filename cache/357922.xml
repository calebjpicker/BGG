On its turn, a werecat may either, take a villager from the village as a victim or turn one of the villagers in the village into a werecat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, penny werecats have the most strength but are expensive to make and are not worth many points. dime werecats are weak, but are cheap to make and worth a lot of points. nickels are in the middle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when there are no villagers left in the village or supply area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most victory points wins.  werecats are worth 2vp for penny werecats, 3vp for nickel werecats, 4vp for dime werecats.&amp;#10;victims are worth 2 vp for the victim type you have the most of, 1vp for the type you have second most of, and 0 for the type you have least of.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blood Coven, WereKittens, and Eldritch Cults are 3 completely different microgames in the world of Cults &amp;amp; Covens.
