						               													<description>Main Event Boxing is a round by round game in which fighter&amp;rsquo;s will perform uncannily close their real life abilities. In Main Event Boxing, fighters are rated for scoring ability, punching power, endurance, defense, ability to absorb punishment, ability to be knocked down or knocked out, susceptibility to cuts and swelling, and how often a fighter commits a foul.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Main Event Boxing features all of the nuances of professional boxing that you see in real life bouts. Quick KO&amp;rsquo;s, TKO&amp;rsquo;s, and close decisions, will all occur on your tabletop with real life accuracy in Main Event Boxing. As in real life boxing, ANYTHING can happen, but you won&amp;rsquo;t see the flash KO&amp;rsquo;s and huge upsets with regularity in Main Event Boxing, like you do with other boxing games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Main Event Boxing is a sequel to FAST Boxing. However, the game has changed a great deal, and it is much more than a ratings update, which is why I gave the game a new name. If you have played FAST Boxing, the game will be somewhat familiar. However, if FAST Boxing wasn&amp;rsquo;t your cup of tea, I ask you to give this game a look, as it is truly THAT much better.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I always felt that FAST Boxing was a &amp;ldquo;complimentary game&amp;rdquo;. It was a game that bridged the gap from a quick playing game, like Ultra Quick Boxing, and a detailed game like Title Bout. Main Event Boxing has shed the &amp;ldquo;complimentary game&amp;rdquo; title now. This game stands on its own with the best of them. While the game does play rapidly, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not a punch-by-punch simulation, I stand firmly behind the accuracy of the game. And most importantly, I find the game play to be quite compelling and easy to pick up and play. This ultimately is the most important thing about any game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fighters, Fighters, Fighters&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The standard game features a vast array of today&amp;rsquo;s current boxing stars. With the standard game, you get over 190 heavyweights, 90 Cruiserweights, 78 Light Heavyweights, 94 Super Middleweights, 82 Middleweights, 108 Junior Middleweights, 112 Welterweights, 122 Junior Welterweights, 115 Lightweights, 75 Junior Lightweights, 89 Featherweights, 76 Junior Featherweights, 74 Bantamweights, 76 Junior Bantamweights, 68 Flyweights, 45 Junior Flyweights, and 128 Strawweights. That&amp;rsquo;s over 1600 active fighters. No other game company can match that! You can rest assured that my research and analysis yields very accurate fight ratings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The match-ups are limitless!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
