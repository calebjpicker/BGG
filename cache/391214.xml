						               													<description>OTLO Stones is an intense brain teaser where up to four players compete to reproduce patterns using two layers of tiles. OTLO Stones challenges your logical skills with multiple levels of difficulty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is equipped with a set of six two-sided tiles with gemstones. Each of these tiles also features one or two holes, providing interesting options when attempting to recreate a pattern of gemstones on a challenge card. The tiles are arranged in two layers, allowing symbols on the bottom-layer tiles to be visible through the holes in the top-layer tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes 60 challenge cards that are divided into three levels of difficulty. Each card awards points based on its level, with level three cards granting three points. At the beginning of the game, all cards are shuffled, and piles of four random face-up cards are placed in the center of the table&amp;mdash;one pile for each player. All players can solve any of the topmost cards in each pile simultaneously.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game progresses as players strive to solve the available challenge cards and accumulate points. To win, players must attain a higher score than their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OTLO Stones also offers solutions for all the challenge cards, ensuring that players can refer to them if needed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
