						               													<description>Flip &amp;amp; Phrase is a game that allows children to use Chinese words flexibly, make sentences by association, and makeup stories creatively. In the first half of the game, children do not need to write, so they can focus on their creation. The second half is &amp;quot;writing&amp;quot;, using associative memory, writing out keywords, and recreating the scene of the story. In the game, there are 200 frequently used words from the Chinese primary school vocabulary list. The vocabulary list requires children to master the dictation of the words and be proficient in basic Chinese words. Using the form of &amp;quot;oral composition&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;extract keywords&amp;quot;, the game lowered the difficulty of the composition and raise the children's learning interest in this subject. The game also makes full use of the means of &amp;quot;listening, speaking, reading, and writing&amp;quot;, combined with a real-time feedback mechanism that children can fully use their imagination to break the shackles of thinking and master the skills of composition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game setup: Each player takes a player map and its corresponding scoreboard, a pencil, and a sheet of notepaper. Each player draws 5 word cards. Hold them in the hand and don't let other players see them&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start the game: Reverse the hourglass for timekeeping. All players have 30 seconds to prepare an impressive story with the 5 words on the card. After 30 seconds, all players place the cards face down on their map from left to right, starting with the first player and telling each player's story in a clockwise manner. To end the game: When all players have finished telling the story, invert the hourglass and wait 30 seconds, then write down the other players' words in order on a sheet of notepaper. When one player has written all the words can be remembered, place the paper in the center of the table and turn the hourglass around again. The other players have another 30 seconds to continue to recall and record words.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all players submit their answers, the words will be revealed by the order of storytelling. Players will give their scoring marks to the player who first turned in the notepaper with all words in a correct manner. 1 point for each correct word (correct order and spelling), 2 points for each player who memorizes 5 words from your story, 2 points for each score mark earned from another player, and -2 points for the player's own score mark. The player with the highest total score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
