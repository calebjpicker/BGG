						               													<description>The Temple of Baruka is a sacred altar in a secret realm where the Baruka tribe worships their God of Totems, Baruka. The Baruka people invite many emissaries to participate in the yearly Totem High Priest Coronation Feast. You will be an emissary and use the totems to complete the Divine Oracles of Baruka. The participant who can genuinely please the Baruka will be crowned by the God of Totems and become the supreme high priest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game players will prepare and place totems on public Altar to worship Baruka. Each players have unique missions (mainly a combination of totem arrangement) to accomplish, which provide rewards. These missions can be accomplished by other players because we are playing on a public Altar, so make sure to pay attention to what your opponents are heading on! Players also can score from &amp;ldquo;Sacrifice&amp;rdquo;, placing totems and form the indicated shapes with the Totems of each color. Furthermore, players may hire helpers to help placing totem. Some helpers may provide extra totems, some may give you ability to knock out/ transform/ rearrange current totems on Altar, and some can provide different ways of scoring. After a few rounds of competition (depend on the number of players), the player with highest score wins the fame and good luck as the supreme high priest of Baruka!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
