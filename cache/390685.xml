						               													<description>You're in charge of a Vegas style casino. It's up to you to bring in as much money as you can. In order to do this you'll need to attract visitors to your casino. You'll be able to attract these visitors by building new and exciting amenities, but watch out, your rivals will be doing the same thing! As the casino boss, you'll be able to expand the four essential casino areas: Gambling, Drinking, Entertainment and Dining.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you'll choose how to use your buying action. You can improve your casino, pave a parking lot, or select an available special. You'll only be able to select one per turn so you'll want to plan wisely. Then after all have gone, the visitor deck is dealt out and the casino with the most matching symbols brings in that visitor. Income and rewards are collected after the deck is dealt, and then you set up the marketplace for the next round. Sound simple right?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts with the first era in Old Vegas when times were simple and casinos can get by with basic slots and a simple bar. You'll play each era 3 times before moving on to the next one. As the new era is revealed, new options will open for you and your rivals to build. New visitors are also added to the game as it continues. They'll be looking for more sophisticated casinos. You'll need to make sure to build the newest options available to continue to keep your doors open. The game also adds in specials to keep you on your toes and each game different than the last.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the last turn is played on the final era all the money is counted up and the casino who raked in the most is proclaimed the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Do you have what it takes to be King of the Casinos?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
