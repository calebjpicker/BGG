						               													<description>Emoji are not new to this earth...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They have lived in an unseen parallel dimension for thousands of years engaged in fierce battles to find their one, true ruler. Now you can join the fight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Emoji Wars, players choose a commander, form an army of allies and use magic and weapons to battle their opponents for dominance over the Emoji empire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player's commander has been killed, that player is out of the game. The player with the last commander standing wins Emoji Wars and rules the Emoji Empire... until the next battle!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The general idea is easy - Players pick a Commander, choose 3 Allies and then battle their opponents with magic spells and weapons. The numbers on the cards line up so you can see if a character has the ability to wield a particular spell or weapon. You can also see how many &amp;quot;Life Points&amp;quot; a character has or how much damage he has taken from a weapon or spell.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Card Types&amp;#10;Gold: Commander&amp;#10;Green: Ally&amp;#10;Blue: Spell&amp;#10;Red: Weapon&amp;#10;Yellow: Energy&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Reading the Cards&amp;#10;Each card has information about the character, spell or weapon in the numbers below the image. A character card shows life points, magic or strength ability and the energy needed to launch an attack. Weapons and spells cards show how much ability is needed to use them and how much damage they will do to a character by reducing his life points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. What a Hand Looks Like&amp;#10;After a player has their &amp;quot;Army&amp;quot; assembled, they draw weapons and spells cards from the blue and red decks. Energy cards are included in these decks and get chosen randomly. A player's hand is visible to the rest of the table. Note that there are also &amp;quot;Shield&amp;quot; cards that add to a character's life points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. Attacks&amp;#10;On each turn a player can attack his opponents if they have the weapons and engergy needed to do so. As an example attack, Orin is using the Deep Freeze against Garlon. The spell card is placed under Orin to show that his life points have reduced by 30. On a later turn, the player draws a Shield, which he adds to Garlon to increase his life points to 30. This is how much damage it will now take to remove him from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5. Win&amp;#10;When a player's Allies have been killed off, he fights with his Commander. If his Commander is killed he is out of the game. The last player with a standing Commander wins Emoji Wars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
