						               													<description>The goal of the game is to accumulate a certain number of points. The number of points needed would be dependent upon how much time could be allotted for the game. A quick game could be played up to 100 points. A greater point total would be set for a more in-depth game experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Each player must roll one die. Whoever gets the highest roll selects a playing piece and places it on a Mission Card Spot. The player with the next highest roll chooses next. This continues until everyone has placed their piece. Note: Players do not get to draw a Mission Card at this time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. The player who placed their piece last gets to play first. This follows until the player who placed their piece goes last.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. The players roll two dice. When the game begins the players must decide which way they will be travelling. On following turns they must continue the direction they were travelling on the previous round. The players may choose to stop moving at any time during their turn. For example, if a player rolls five on the dice, but only need three to get to a Question Spot, they may cease movement on the Spot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. The direction of movement cannot be changed until one of the following has occurred: the player lands on a Question Spot; the player lands on a Mission Card Spot; or the player has a Mission Card that allows reversal of motion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5. Players must land on question spots to be asked questions. The answers will be presented in a multiple-choice format. When a question is answered correctly, the player recieves the number of points printed on the card. The person who moved previously acts as the questioner. If this happens on the first turn, the player who goes last asks the question. The questioner draws a Question Card corresponding to the map grid and the color landed on by the player. There are three levels of difficulty for answering questions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Level One: Beginning learners would play for the full point total and would have the multiple choice answers read to them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Level Two: Intermediate play would have the most options; the learner can answer the question for full points by not having the multiple choice answers read to them and for half points if they need to have their answer options read to them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Level Three: Advanced learners would play for the full point total without having the multiple choice answers read to them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6. If the player does not answer the question correctly, the remaining players may attempt to jump in and steal the question. If they answer correctly, they gain half the points that the original player would have recieved. If they answer incorrectly, they lose half of the points the original player would have recieved. All other remaining players may attempt this with the exception of the Questioner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7. After successfully answering a question, the player must move to another map grid before stopping at another Question Spot. This does not apply to players who jumped in on someone else's question.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;8. When the players land on a Mission Card spot, they get to draw one Mission card. Some Mission Cards may be saved for later and others must be played immediately. The card should state when it comes into effect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;9. The game concludes at a predetermined win scenario. The game can be played towards a point limit. For example, the first player with 100 points could be the winner. Alternately, the game can be played to a time limit. PLay could be set to end in 30 minutes and whoever has the most points would be the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
