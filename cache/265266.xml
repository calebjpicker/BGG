						               													<description>The Universal Tabletop Strategy Game of Gods, Monsters, and Machines&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the mountains of Olympus to the depths of the darkest oceans, they awoke from their long slumber. Gods, demi-gods, titans, demons and other-worldly beings from your nightmares came from myth and became reality. Alliances formed and the stage was set for war like never before seen on Earth, or even beneath it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mankind has found itself between colossal forces of legendary power. C&amp;rsquo;thulean terrors rise from the oceans as gods ride winged beasts into battle. Meanwhile, the armies of humanity fight simply to survive. With the awakening of the gods, long dormant demi-gods, mutants, and freaks, have unleashed chaos on the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This new world disorder has left many cities burning husks while the people flee to the remaining bastions of safety and security.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Immortal Wars is a table-top strategy game mixing fantasy, modern, science-fiction, and superhero genres. Do battle with tanks, infantry, hovercraft, jet fighters, giant mecha, mutants, superhumans, and abominations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Immortal Wars is played on a flat surface (a minimum of 4' x 6' is recommended) with distances measured in inches (the game uses the curiously mixed ratio of 1 inch to 7.5 meters).  Combatants are represented by miniature figures (representing single units) with an associated &amp;quot;unit card&amp;quot; providing data and tracking damage, etc.  Combat and movement occur in rounds, each round representing about six seconds.  Random results are generated using only twelve-sided dice (d12).  Several dice in different colors are recommended.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game assumes two &amp;quot;sides&amp;quot; in each combat, each controlled by one (optionally more) player.  Each player builds their force by purchasing units with points.  One player is the defender; the other player is the attacker.  Setup follows a pre-determined &amp;quot;scenario&amp;quot; (setup guide).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During each round, initiative is determined.  The losing player moves 1/2 of their units; the winning player moves 1/2 of their units; the losing player move the remainder of their units; the winning player moves the remainder of their units.  Most units can move vertically as well as horizontally.  Units utilize a somewhat simplified method of two-dimensional facing.  Attacks are resolved at the end of a movement, if legal - this means the player that loses initiative will perform the first attacks of the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game supports a wide range of combatant types, from mecha to armor to monsters.  Many units have special abilities that invoke special rules.  A variety of terrain and status situations may apply.  The game also provides a wide variety of optional rules (including adjustments to 25mm scale).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play persists until one player achieves pre-determined victory results or eliminates the other player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game document includes a large number of print-and-play tokens to mark various effects on the battlefield.  Also included are blank, print-and-play unit cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
