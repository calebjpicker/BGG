						               													<description>Alhambra Zoo / Buildings of Power / Travelling Craftsmen were offered together under the &amp;quot;Get to Know&amp;quot; pledge for Alhambra: Designers' Expansions Box.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alhambra Zoo:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The animals are loose in the Alhambra! Your goal is to bring them to the chambers. But each kind of animal only brings victory points if they are in a chamber with just their kind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each time a chamber is revealed to the building market two animal tiles are drawn and placed on that chamber. There are 6 different animal kinds in the game, each awarding points at the end, but only if it is kept in a chamber which only has his kind on it. In order to move the animals to the desired chambers a player has the option to play a money card at the end of their turn, moving an animal one space (from building to building) for each value on the card plaid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who organizes their animals most cleverly will earn additional victory points at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: 18 animal chips&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Buildings of Power:&amp;#10;The Towers in the game are replaced with new ones, each having a special ability:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blueprint - The player rolls a die and draws that many building tiles, choosing one to keep. The others are returned to the draw tower in the order the player chooses. The building tile the player kept can be placed on the building market at the start of any player's turns, replacing any already on the tableau. The exchanged tile is placed back in the draw tower.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Loan - The player rolls a die and draws that many money cards from the draw pile, choosing one of them to keep. The others are returned to the top of the draw pile in the order the player chooses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Discount - The player rolls a die and places it on the tower. Every time the player purchases his first building in the round, he can choose to decrease the value on the die by one to decrease the purchase prize by one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pinnacle - The player rolls a die and places it on the tower. When scoring walls that number is added to the shortest external wall. This can propel the smaller wall to be the biggest and therefore score more points for the player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: 11 alternate tower tiles, 4 white dice, 32 black dice, and 1 purple die&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Travelling Craftsmen:&amp;#10;The Craftsman came from the far away&amp;mdash;Carcasonne to Andalusia&amp;mdash;to help build the Alhambra.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game each player will receive one traveling craftsman which can be used for their ability on a future turn. Once used, the craftsman travels to the next player in clockwise position who then can use him. The craftsman have various abilities that can give a player bonuses on their turns. Following are some of the abilities:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Switch - Before buying a building tile the player may swap two buildings on the building market.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Change - The player may exchange an money card in his hand with one from the display.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Direction - A player may build a building in their Alhambra, rotating it in any direction desired.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: 6 craftsmen cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
