						               													<description>A card game for 2 players based on the movie &amp;ldquo;Sorcerers Apprentice&amp;rdquo;. One player is the good Merlinians. The other is the evil Morganians.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common deck containing cards of seven types: &amp;#10;Merlinian Sorcerers, Morganian Sorcerers, Spells, Amplifiers, Objects, Events and Defence.  Most cards have a power rating which is used during the duel (combat) phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Merlinian player starts with Balthazar in play and the Grimhold which is equipped to Balthazar. The Morganian player starts with Horvath in play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both players draw 5 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn has 6 Phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.  Lore Phase&amp;#10;-   Both players draw 2 cards from the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.  Recruit Phase&amp;#10;-   You may put one sorcerer into play from your hand and any number of objects. Sorcerers may give their objects to each other (max 3 objects per sorcerer). Excess objects are discarded. &amp;#10;-   The Merlinian player may only recruit Merlinian Sorcerers. &amp;#10;-   The Morganian player may only recruit Morganian Sorcerers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3.  Event Phase&amp;#10;-   Starting with the Merlinian player, players may take turns discarding cards with event abilities to activate and immediately resolve those abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.  Encounter Phase&amp;#10;-   Each player randomly picks one of their sorcerers to undertake a duel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5.  Duel Phase&amp;#10;-   The two Sorcerers who have encountered each other will now fight as follows.&amp;#10;-   Each player will make an attack combo which are then revealed simultaneously. For their attack combo each player may play one spell, one event and up to 3 amplifiers&amp;#10;-   Derive a power total for each sorcerer = the sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s power + equipped objects + spell + played event + amplifiers.&amp;#10;-   Each player may play up to one defence card. These will cause certain opposing cards to be discarded, thus changing the power totals. &amp;#10;-   The sorcerer with the higher power total is the combat winner. The losing sorcerer is discarded.&amp;#10;-   The combat Loser may play a protection spell. This prevents the losing sorcerer from being discarded and his objects from being stolen.&amp;#10;-   The winner takes the losing Sorcerers objects AND looks at his opponents hand AND then steals one target card from his opponents hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6.  End Phase&amp;#10;-   Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &amp;#10;-   Check for Victory Conditions. Record Time Markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Merlinian player has 2 ways to win: &amp;#10;1.  Destroy Morgana: Defeat her by 7 or more power in a Combat. &amp;#10;2.  Prime Merlinian Succession: Keep Dave Stutler in play for 7 consecutive turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Morganian player has 1 way to win: &amp;#10;Cast the Rising Spell: Keep Morgana in play for 5 consecutive turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both players may win by the following method: &amp;#10;Army of Sorcerers: Have 6 more sorcerers in play than your opponent in the end phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
