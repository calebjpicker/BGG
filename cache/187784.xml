						               													<description>Throughout the history of mankind conflict is at the core of our evolution, evident in each generation with war and expansion of territories to show dominance of one empire over its rivals. Such aggression is not a choice of right or wrong, but is instilled into our DNA through the course of evolution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This strategy game challenges players to execute military war tactics, allows for population growth, encourages development of city infrastructure to fuel the economy, forces long term rewards to be weighed against immediate benefits, and calls for the management of your civilization's resource expenditure. Winning is a combination of dice rolls and decision making. The key to success is using your economic engine to fuel growth and strategically engage in battles to weaken your opponent and strengthen your dominance on the map. Victory points are gained through killing enemy population, building a city capital, being the peace maker, acquiring special events, and conquering enemy land. No one strategy wins the game but is a combination of several of the victory points to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How the game is played section: Players have two choices at the start of their return, (1) Improve Economy or (2) Battle.
