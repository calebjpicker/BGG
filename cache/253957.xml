						               													<description>Minotaurs&amp;rsquo; enormous strength, minimal intelligence and vicious, depraved mentality would appear to make them almost perfect Blood Bowl players. Fortunately for most other players however, few coaches allow Minotaurs in their team. This is mainly because of their disconcerting habit of going berserk before, during and after the match and attacking anyone or anything that gets in their way: friends, foes &amp;ndash; even the coach!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This multi-part resin kit contains the components you need in order to assemble a Blood Bowl Minotaur. You can field him as a Big Guy for your Chaos, Chaos Dwarf, Chaos Chosen or Chaos Renegades team &amp;ndash; he definitely lives up to this, looking both pretty big and pretty chaotic. Densely packed with powerful muscle, the Minotaur is stomping forth with fury, challenging any opposing player to get in the way of his bunched fists and enormous horns. He&amp;rsquo;s not particularly heavily armoured, but the bits of armour he has strapped on are menacing and spiky, with a delightful skull on the right shoulder; this probably used to belong to someone who didn&amp;rsquo;t get out of the way quickly enough.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;'NOTE: An alternate version of the Blood Bowl Minotaur was a limited release in June 2019:'&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All minotaurs are slab-muscled and vicious as a rule. On top of all that, some of them carry mutations that make them even more intimidating and lethal, like this cruelly clawed brute. He&amp;rsquo;s also been fitted with a suitably brutal-looking helmet to protect what&amp;rsquo;s left of his grey matter. Minotaurs make ideal Blood Bowl players, but few coaches allow them in their team. This is mainly because of their disconcerting habit of going berserk before, during and after the match and attacking anyone or anything that gets in their way &amp;ndash; friends, foes or even the coach!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can field this Minotaur as a Big Guy for your Chaos, Chaos Dwarf, Chaos Chosen or Chaos Renegades team &amp;ndash; his enormous mutated claws and sturdy head gear blend well with the look of brutal and corrupted teams. Densely packed with powerful muscle, the Minotaur charges forward to challenge anyone who gets in his way. Well armoured, his kit is fittingly menacing and spiky, with a form-fitting helmet and bulbous eye protectors, as well as a delightful skull on the right shoulder &amp;ndash; this probably used to belong to someone who didn&amp;rsquo;t get out of the way quickly enough.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This kit comes as 6 resin components and is supplied with a 32mm round Blood Bowl base, featuring a slot to place a ball in. Rules for the Minotaur can be found in Death Zone Season Two and the Inaugural Blood Bowl Almanac!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
