						               													<description>Object of the game: To capture the most pebbles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting: Cards are shuffled and each player draws three cards. A card is drawn from the pile and placed in the middle face up. This will be the card that the first player builds on. Group chooses who will go first and players take turns going clockwise. Figure 1 below shows an example of a card being played on from the deck. Noticed that a pebble is placed on two overlapping red squares.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards: There are 80 cards made up of three colored squares per card. Cards are placed on top of each other so that at least one of the three squares on the card lays on top of another square of a card with the same color.  Red squares can only go on top of red squares, blue squares can only go on top of blue squares, etc. More than one square can go on top of other squares if the squares laid on top of other squares matches the same color. If a player is unable to lay a card on top of another card then they are skipped to the next player. Figure 2 below shows how a card can be placed on top of two other cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards must also be able to match colors when adjacent sides are touching other adjacent sides. Figure 3 shows an examples of a card that is not acceptable because the yellow square does not match the red square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pebbles: Players draw from the pile of black pebbles when placing a pebble on a square. Only black pebbles are played on cards, white and red pebbles are used to reduce the number of black pebbles needed in a game. Black pebbles have a value of one point. Every time a player collects 5 black pebbles they turn them into the pile to replenish it and take one white pebble which is worth the 5 black pebbles. A red pebble is worth 10 black pebbles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pebble Placement: Where ever a card square overlaps another card square a pebble is placed on that square. Up to three pebbles can be placed in one turn if a card is placed that overlaps three squares of the same colors. Figure 4 shows an example of one card being placed on top of three other squares. Three black pebbles are placed on top of each square that matches.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Capturing Pebbles: Capturing is done by jumping pebbles. A pebble can jump another pebble as long as there is a space (square from a card) to jump into over a pebble. Pebbles can jump in any direction. Multiple jumps can be made in one turn as long as there is a pebble next to another pebble and a space to space to jump into. Figure 5 shows an example of jumps that can be made in one turn. There are other combinations to jumping than what is shown in Figure 5.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of Game: The game ends when all the cards are used up from the deck and the player&amp;rsquo;s hands. Who ever has the most points in their pile wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
