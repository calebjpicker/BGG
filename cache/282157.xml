						               													<description>Khans of Tarkir is a Magic: The Gathering block consisting of Khans of Tarkir (September 26, 2014), Fate Reforged (January 23, 2015), and Dragons of Tarkir (March 27, 2015). The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia. It is the last block to have three expansion sets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tarkir is the birthplace of the dragon-worshipping planeswalker Sarkhan Vol, first introduced in Shards of Alara. At the beginning of the Khans set, Sarkhan returns to Tarkir and learns that the extinction of Tarkir's dragons was linked to one specific event. Some thousand years ago, there was an epic battle between two dragon planeswalkers: Nicol Bolas, one of the greatest manipulators in the multiverse, and Ugin the Spirit Dragon, who helped trap the Eldrazi on Zendikar. Now that the Eldrazi have arisen again, both Sarkhan and Sorin Markov have arrived on Tarkir, the last known location of Ugin, in search of his help. Discovering that Ugin is dead, Sarkhan resolves to travel back in time and save him. His travels in the Tarkir of 1,280 years ago are chronicled in the set Fate Reforged. He finds a world where the five human clans do not fight each other, instead fending off constant attacks from Tarkir's many dragons; the clans still model themselves on a particular quality, which is epitomized by a Legendary Dragon creature whom each clan reveres and strives to emulate. The set focuses more on the color at the center of each wedge and its ally, with the enemy color given very little presence. The dragons who serve as the inspiration for each clan have their own watermarks, which are modified versions of the clan sigil. Additionally, Morph is missing; instead, a mechanic which is described as being Morph's precursor, &amp;quot;Manifest,&amp;quot; allows players to put any card face-down as a 2/2 creature, and flip them again only if their obverse was a creature to begin with.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Abzan Houses (White, Black, Green) are led by Daghatar the Adamant, an aloof and analytical leader. They revere Dromoka, the Eternal. In the past, their mechanic is &amp;quot;Bolster,&amp;quot; which lets players strengthen the weakest of their creatures.&amp;#10;The Jeskai Way (Blue, White, Red) are led by Shu Yun, the Silent Tempest, who seeks to preserve knowledge. They revere Ojutai, Soul of Winter. They retain the Prowess mechanic.&amp;#10;The Sultai Brood (Black, Green, Blue) are led by Tasigur, the Golden Fang, an indolent and spoiled prince. They revere Silumgar, the Drifting Death. They retain the Delve mechanic.&amp;#10;The Mardu Horde (Red, White, Black) are led by Alesha, Who Smiles At Death, a transgender warrior who managed to negotiate a position as equals for her clan. They revere Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury. In the past, their mechanic is &amp;quot;Dash,&amp;quot; which allows players to cast creatures at reduced mana cost, but with the added corollary that the creature must return to hand at the end of the turn.&amp;#10;The Temur Frontier (Green, Blue, Red) are led by Yasova Dragonclaw (all Temur khans take the title &amp;quot;Dragonclaw&amp;quot;), Sarkhan Vol's first friend in the past, who dreams of a world where the humans of Tarkir are no longer prey to dragons. They revere Atarka, World Render. They retain the Ferocious mechanic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
