						               													<description>Preparing for a trip to the Grand Canyon, the designers wanted games that were light, fun, and travel friendly.  To save weight and space, they put them all in one deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Flex Deck combines: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     traditional playing cards (suit and rank in top left corner)&amp;#10;     double-9 dominoes (middle of card)&amp;#10;     letter/word games (letter in bottom left corner)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The main goal of Flex Deck is to let the owners play with it any way they want. Their website was a place where people could post rules to games they have invented for the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck includes rules to one omnibus game, Pick How You Play. In each round, players play either All Fives Dominoes, or Rummy, and the first to 200 points wins. Between each round, players play a word game where each makes a crossword from their hand of 15 cards, with the player using the most cards choosing whether to play dominoes or rummy for the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
