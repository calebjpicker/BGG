						               													<description>ElevatorUp is the brand NEW kid-created, kid-designed, kid-marketed, and kid-shipped (yes, they're all me) card game! Elevator Up will keep you smiling through Ups, Downs, and even getting Stuck!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ElevatorUp is fast-paced, easy-to-learn, and never gets old. Uno, GoFish, and other classic card games begin to become monotonous. Luckily, ElevatorUp provides a much needed innovation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is perfect for Travel, Camp, Sleepovers, Parties, Game-Nights, and any other occasion for a card game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THEME:&amp;#10;An elevator going Up, Down, and sometimes Stuck in a building!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY:&amp;#10;Object - Be the first one out of cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup - Give each player 3 cards face down on the table (no one is allowed to look at these), 2 cards face up on the table (everyone can see these), and 3 cards for their hand (only that player can look at those).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay -  There are three sections of the game: Beginning: Hand Cards, Middle: Face Up Cards, End: Face Down Cards.&amp;#10;When it is your turn, you must discard a card that is either an equal/higher floor than the previously played card or a special card. If there is no previously played card, then you can play any card. Continue taking turns and discarding cards until someone does not have a special card or an equal/higher floor, meaning they must pick up the entire discard pile and add it to their hand. Players must keep at least 3 cards in their hand at all times, replenishing from the remainder of the deck. The special cards, including New Building, Stuck, Penthouse, Door Closed, and Down to the Lobby, throw exciting twists and turns.&amp;#10;Once the deck has been completely used up and players finish playing the cards in their hand, they move onto the face up cards, leaving them for all to see. The rules are the same for this section, but their hand can be seen by other players. Once they've gotten rid of their face up cards, it is time to play their face down cards. When it is their turn, the player will flip a card onto the discard pile. If it is an equal/higher floor or a special card, then shout &amp;quot;YAY&amp;quot; or any other celebratory exclamation. If it does not, then put on your game face and pick up the entire discard pile, adding it to your hand. The first player out of cards WINS!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
