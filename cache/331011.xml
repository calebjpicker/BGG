						               													<description>TRANGLAR (pronounced &amp;quot;Tr&amp;agrave;nglar&amp;quot;) is an abstract strategy game for 2 players with various, multi shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board. It is a straightforward yet intelligent game, created to challenge both new and experienced gamers. It plays in around 15-25 minutes, ideal for a quick and challenging gaming experience. Each piece is made up of triangles and has a different color on each side, one for each player, while neutral pieces have the same color on both sides.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tranglar Game Board&amp;#10;42 game pieces (17 for each player, 8 neutral)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal of the Game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has to place as many of their pieces on the board in order to take over as much space on it as possible. To achieve this they must place their pieces on the board in such a way that they are protected and as to take over their opponents&amp;rsquo; pieces by encircling them and flipping them to their color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turn Overview:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During their turn each player can take one of the four following actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Place a new piece of your color on the board in a valid position. Valid positions are the ones that are unoccupied on the board, and not encircled by the opponents&amp;rsquo; pieces. The board is divided in small triangle slots. The piece you place, must take up the total area of the triangles they cover.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Replace a piece that is already on the board with other/s of yours. This action allows you to replace one of your pieces which is already placed on the board with more pieces that take up the exact same area, and you have available outside the board, or two or more adjacent pieces you own, which are already placed on the board, with one piece that takes up the exact same area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Attack an opponent&amp;rsquo;s piece (stealing a piece). This action allows you to steal any one of the opponents' pieces which is already on the board: flip it to your color side and place it outside the board with the rest of your pieces. Then you are obliged to cover that space with at least two of your own pieces which equal in size to the area of the piece you took.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. You can pass your turn. It is probably not a frequent case, but if it is not possible to do any of the above-described actions or for any reason you wish, you can forfeit your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of Game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most with the most triangular slots on the board with their color, wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
