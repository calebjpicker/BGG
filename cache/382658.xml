						               													<description>Ephemeral Path is a quick and customizable skirmish game for two players. Ephemeral Path uses no set miniatures or figures but instead allows players to play with either printable pieces or miniatures they already own. Players create customized stats and ability combinations for each figure they play with by making figure stat sheets on the game's website and printing them off. Games are short, and use no custom dice or cards. Other than standard polyhedral dice, everything players need to play with is printable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Story: The paths have opened up across space and time. Intelligent beings of all types have been lured through the mystifying black gates that mark the path&amp;rsquo;s root. Whatever the being&amp;rsquo;s reason for embarking along the path, science, curiosity, instinct, their aspirations have shifted to mere survival. Once the gate had been activated it vanishes shortly after, never returning. Those who managed to traverse the path found themselves on a desolate planet, with no way home. The planet grew more crowded and dangerous by the hour as intelligent creatures from every corner of the universe flooded its barren surface. After some time, the gates that mark the head of the path began to appear on this planet as well. With resources running thin, most chose to take their chances with these newly opened gates. If they could only get to them before they close.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played on a 40cm x 40cm play area with a round, 9cm gate placed on the board. Each player begins the game with a set of between two and six figures.  Each figure has only two or three actions per game so players must use their actions precisely in order to maximize their chances of winning.  Players win by having the most figures in contact with the gate after each player has run out of actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
