						               													<description>Card game for diehard Hannah Montana fans because you will need to know her songs very well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle the deck and place one card face-up next to it. This is the start of the discard pile. Shuffle the Points cards (they vary from 1 to 10 points).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The main cards have a symbol on them. That is important. The symbols are;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Music note: name the title of a Hannah Montana song which includes the word on the card.&amp;#10;Flower: sing 2 lines from the chorus of a Hannah Montana song, which includes the words on the card.&amp;#10;Butterfly: say 3 things about the character on the card.&amp;#10;Star: this is the secret Joker card! Draw a point card without having to carry out an assignment. All other players are required to draw an action card!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Play. If the player has an action card, of which the colour or symbol corresponds with the top card of the discard pile, he/she can discard it.&amp;#10;If the symbol is identical, then he/she can execute the assignment (see above) on the card he/she is discarding. The other players will judge whether the assignment is successful. If the assignment is successful, then the player can draw 1 points card. If both the symbol and the colour are the same, then the player can draw two points cards! If the assignment was unsuccessful, then the player does not get to draw a points card.&amp;#10;If the symbol is different, but the colour is the same, then he/she does not get to carry out an assignment.&amp;#10;If the player does not have a suitable action card (other symbol and other colour), then he/she has to draw another action card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who has collected the most points when the Points cards have run out is the winner, the Secret Star of the Music Game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
