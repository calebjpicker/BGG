						               													<description>The Phoenix expansion for Wyvern introduces two new types of Action cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hidden Action&amp;#10;Play under a face down card during an Action Phase. The Hidden Action card tells you whether to play it under one of your cards or under an opponent's card. The Hidden Action is not revealed until the card it is placed under gets turned face up during the normal course of play. You may not look at any Hidden Actions placed under your cards by your opponent until your card comes face up during play. Place the Hidden Actions sideways as a reminder of this. As soon as a card with a Hidden Action under it comes face up, check to see if the Hidden Action applies to the card it is under. If it does not apply, it is discarded and has no effect. If it does apply, follow the instructions on the Hidden Action card. The Hidden Action card remains attached to the card it was under for as long as that card is in play, unless it is removed by a game action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Intercept Action&amp;#10;Play immediately after your opponent has chosen a dragon to use for attack, and has announced which card he is attacking. If your opponent is attacking a face down card, you play the Intercept Action before the card is turned face up. If the Interceptor has a base strength, the attacking dragon must kill the Interceptor before reaching the intended target of its attack. The attacking dragon and the Interceptor fight a normal battle with the Interceptor counting as a dragon in the row attacked. If the outcome is anything other than the Interceptor being killed, the Battle Phase ends immediately. This means that the Interceptor could lose the battle but survive with a Golden Apple or Fountain of Youth, and the Battle Phase would still end. If the battle is cancelled, the Battle Phase ends. If the Interceptor wins the battle, the losing Dragon dies and the Interceptor is discarded, ending the Battle Phase. If the attacking Dragon does kill the Interceptor, it then immediately attacks the card it originally intended to attack. If the Intercept Action does not have a base strength, follow the instructions on the card. Intercept Actions are always discarded after use.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
