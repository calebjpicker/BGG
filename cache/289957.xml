						               													<description>INTRODUCTION&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A certain something filled the air. While energizing the magic crystal in his wand, Orly suddenly felt a change he couldn&amp;rsquo;t name. Usually this ritual took only seconds before the crystal power kicked in. Not today &amp;hellip; it took him minutes to obtain the desired power required to load his wand for the adventurous travel ahead of him. While waiting for the blessing of the crystal power he noticed something dark. Something was lurking in the mist absorbing the essential and much needed crystal power from the crystal fragments orbiting around their world, Amanaar. In light of the immense threat to their habitat, Orly decided to set off on a journey, visiting some of the remarkable creatures of Amanaar in order to seek out the dark power that threatens their very lives. Never in his humble existence would he have imagined that some of his friends would turn against him in a battle for the Lost Lights of Amanaar ...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Lost Lights, two players battle with their party of diverse animalistic characters for control over the Regions of Amanaar. In the beginning each player drafts 10 out of 27 beautifully and individually illustrated cards. On your turn you play a card from your hand and take a number of actions equal to the action point value on the card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions allow you to reinforce your party with new followers or to move your followers between the Areas on the map. In Areas where both parties meet, you&amp;rsquo;ll battle each other. To resolve battles both of you secretly choose one character card from your hand as a leader in this battle, using their special ability. After the special abilities are resolved, your combined battle strength is added up. If you lose the battle, remove your party from the contested area. If you win you are now the dominant force in that area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends immediately if one of you has no party members left on the map or if both of you run out of cards. When the game ends you add up your scores for each Area. Whoever achieved the higher score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
