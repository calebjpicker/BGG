						               													<description>Mastermind Ultimate Cribbage (also called &amp;quot;Masters Cribbage&amp;quot;) is a card game stemming from the classic Cribbage, with some additional cards. It is played with a standard deck of cards,along with six new types: Super Fives, Zero Card, Super Ace, Wild, Super Card, and the Master Card. In addition it uses a cribbage board which is a signature piece of equipment with holes and pegs for scoring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib. One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib. The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences. Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board. This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards. Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board. The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points. Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2-players and teams of two play a full length game to 181 points. 3 individuals end play until 141 points. 4 individual players play to a standard cribbage length game of 121 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The six special cards are the crux of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Zero Card: When someone plays a card for a 15 or 31 during pegging, play the Zero-Card next to collect an additional 2 points for the 15 or 31. You must play the Zero-Card if you can played in a run or double run with zero, ace, and two.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Super Ace: A Super-Ace pairs every ace. You can use a Super-Ace as a high ace for a run of queen, king and Super-Ace for both counting and pegging. The Super-Ace can be played as 1 or 11 during pegging. The value of the Super-Ace is 1 [u]and[/] 11 during counting (as though you had one of each card). The holder can also use as 1 and 11 with fours to total 15 points during counting the hand total.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special Fives: Extra fives in play allows the high hand to go from 29 to 45 with 5 fives. The total points of  five 5&amp;rsquo;s is 20. The 15 combinations are 20 and five pairs is another 20 making a total of 40 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wild Cards: During pegging play you must use the Wild Card at the same face value as the point counting portion of the hand. Play a Wild Card as a seven during pegging, you must count it as a seven when you total your hand&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Super Wild: The Super-Wild is a Wild Card with one extra feature. It can be played during pegging as one face value and counted at another. You can play a Super-Wild as a seven during pegging and use it as a five during counting. If you play it as a 10 value you must specify it as a 10 or other face card value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Master: The Master is like a Super-Wild played as a separate face value during pegging and counting. The Master allows the extra option to play it after calling &amp;lsquo;go&amp;rsquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
