						               													<description>Two new enahancements in one huge package.  First is the Command and Control enhancement which premiers the first of its kind Radio Line of Sight checks.  All HQ units must check to see if they have good communication and use a Radio Line of Sight to check this.  If the commo check fails the HQ without good commo must check its initiative to see if it will have to attack or regroup or freeze.  The HQ will also have to check and see if the commo check is intercepted and/or located.  When located the HQ becomes a possible target for enemy artillery counter fire.  If the commo check is intercepted the HQ gives up a negative DRM to the enemy player for combats until commo is re-established.  The game will now include Signal units that are the focal point for transmissions and maintaining good commo with subordinate and higher HQ.  The last and most exciting part of this specific enhancement is the inclusion of German Company level counters and an optional Tiger Tank Battalion that could have joined the battle if the Axis High Command hadn't sent it to North Afrika and wasted it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each German Division and Soviet Army have a new Task Organization Chart that provides the players a means to change the assignments of Companies in the case of the Germans and Battalions in the case of the Soviets.  These charts are the ultimate in showing the command relationships that change on the battlefield and help to keep the troops organized.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to all this is the Fire Support elements.  Counters that show specific artillery battery assignments and what those assignments mean.  There are artillery mission markers for Direct Support (DS), General Support (GS), and Reinforcing (R).  These missions have specific rules that restrict artillery fire on the field of battle to what they could actually do.  Coupled with the Task Organization charts you will need to plan carefully in order to have the right amount of artillery available to support different parts of your divisions.  The Fire Support Enhancement gives you the ability to fire smoke and even provides for better counter-battery fire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are now some new counters to support play.  These are included at the direct request of the playtesters and will help you keep track of when units have fired, moved, opportunity fired, with either secondary or primary weapons, and which units are Out of Command or Out of Supply.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
