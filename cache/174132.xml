						               													<description>Smash &amp;amp; Grab: A Two Person Job is a cooperative two-player game where you're charged with organizing the heist of well-guarded treasures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Smash &amp;amp; Grab, you choose a location to pull off your heist, choose 2 of 6 possible characters to perform the heist with, and then alternate revealing new events that occur during the heist and playing actions to a timeline in order to get in, grab the loot, and get out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game centers around resource management. Every round, a card from the event deck will be played to the timeline, which will increase the 'bad' resources (threat, fatigue, and setbacks) and limit your ability to gain the 'good' resource (progress). Then, players will take turns playing a card to the timeline to counteract these 'bad' resources while gaining as much progress as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has a hand of general action cards and starts the game with 3 powerful character-specific actions. Each action card adds or subtracts one or several resources, as well as sometimes giving the player access to powerful abilities such as looking through the action or event decks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The resources are kept track of on shared boards. Each minute of the timeline has a threat track to keep track of the amount of threat you have minute-to-minute. Additionally, there is a progress and fatigue mat that is used in combination with specific tokens to keep track of your current totals for those resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you are able to accumulate enough progress while keeping threat and fatigue low enough before you run out of space on the timeline or the event deck runs out, then you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
