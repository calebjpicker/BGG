						               													<description>Final Round Fighting Card Game is a two-player card game which emulates Arcade Fighting Games of the 90s.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Final Round Fighting Card Game, players play cards to simulate attacking and defending against their opponent as they attempt to deal damage to one-another, removing cards from their opponents deck as damage is done. The players deck is made up of cards, each of which represent a move the character they are playing as is able to perform. Cards lost from the deck through damage become a resource from which players draw.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As with Arcade Fighting Games, there are Basic Attacks (simple 1-button punches and kicks), Special Attacks (more complicated or specialized moves, frequently unique to a character), Basic Block and Special Blocks (Basic Block is reusable throughout the game, Special Blocks have an additional effect) and Ultimate moves (the big, flashy finishers).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards/Moves in Final Round Fighting Card Game are balanced by i. Attack Speed (how fast a card is), ii. Combo Speed (the maximum Attack Speed of the card to follow it in a Combo), iii. Damage (the number of cards your opponent loses from their deck when they're hit with the attack alone or in a Combo), and iv. Card Abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay consists of playing cards defensively to your own High, Mid, and Low zones, or playing a card aggressively to Attack your opponent in one of their three zones (the zones are largely thematic, to represent the &amp;quot;spacing&amp;quot; aspect from fighting video games). Attacks are successful when they are faster than the card in the zone they were played to, with Blocks being an automatic success for the defending player, and ties being broken by revealing the top card of players' decks and using the Attack Speed of the revealed card. On successfully attacking the opponent, players have the ability to play additional cards, making a Combo, with each successive card in a Combo requiring having an Attack Speed which is equal to or less than the Combo Speed of the last card which was played. During a players turn, they have two Actions, in which they can play defensively to draw cards and reset their defenses, or to attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
