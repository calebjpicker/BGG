						               													<description>The Mexican Revolution that began in 1910 with the overthrow of dictator Porfirio Diaz degenerated into civil war following the assassination of President Francisco Madero. By end of 1915 the forces of President Carranza were arrayed against a variety of leaders supporting either themselves or General Victoriano Huerta. Pancho Villa, commander of the Mexican Army del Norte, at first supported Carranza, but then went rogue after the US Government recognized Carranza&amp;rsquo;s government. Historians still debate Villa&amp;rsquo;s reasons, but in early March 1916 he decided to enter the US and raid the town of Columbus, New Mexico. Although the town was where the 13th Regiment US Cavalry was garrisoned, he knew most of the troopers were scattered along the border. Believing the town was only weakly guarded, his force of just under 500 men were to steal arms, provisions and horses while also wreaking as much havoc as possible. Such a raid he believed could galvanize the US government into a retaliatory strike that would drag Carranza&amp;rsquo;s government into a war with the US it could not win, or a humiliating capitulation that would outrage the Mexican people. Either way, Villa reasoned, it would mean the downfall of Carranza.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Villa&amp;rsquo;s Vengeance is an introductory level wargame simulation portraying the March 9, 1916 raid on Columbus, New Mexico. Players are cast in the roles of Villa&amp;rsquo;s raiding force and the defending US regular and militia forces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each copy of Villa's Vengeance is composed of the following:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One 11 by 17 inch area map&amp;#10;63 un-mounted, double-sided units&amp;#10;One set of rules&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players use a standard deck of playing cards (a custom set of cards is available from the publisher) and a six sided die to play the game. Players use the cards to determine who gets to activate and with how many activations. When a Joker card is drawn random events are determined (first joker) or the end or the turn ends (second joker).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
