						               													<description>From the back of the box and the instruction manual:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Score tickets &amp;amp; catch your fave band on tour!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Are you ready to rock with The Naked Brothers Band?  Hit the roads and tour around North America trying to score tickets to the Naked Brothers Band's sold-out shows.  Follow the band from city to city and visit awesome places like Seattle - Boston - San Fran and Miami.  If you're the first fan to make it to the show, you'll get the best tickets and increase your score.  So, hit the road and catch as many concerts as you can.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Gameboard&amp;#10;- 4 Tour Bus cardboard pawns and pawn stands&amp;#10;- 21 City cards&amp;#10;- 24 Concert tickets&amp;#10;- 24 Rest stop cards&amp;#10;- 45 Travel cards&amp;#10;- Instructions&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Play:&amp;#10;On your turn, you're trying to get to the next concert city to get the best seats possible.  Concerts must be played in the order they are on the board, and all tickets from the first concert must be taken before the next concert can make its tickets available, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To move your bus toward a concert city, draw a travel card and place it face up so all can see.  If it is a move card, there will be a white bus on the card. You can move your bus the number of spaces the white bus indicates.  If there are other buses on the card, that color bus also gets to move.  If your colored bus also happens to be on the card, then you may move again.  Buses are moved in the order they are played on the card.  In a two or three player game, ignore any buses not being played.  If you happen to end your turn on the same space as another player, then jump ahead to the next space.  In some cases, the player who drew the card will also get to move another player's bus.  These are wrong turn cards.  Any special instructions will be on the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sometimes a card will have special instructions, such as move to any city, or swap tickets with another player.  In these cases instead of moving this turn, just do what the card says.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you begin to move in a direction, you cannot backtrack on the same road.  The only exception is in the case where a card you draw has your color bus on it as well.  These are considered two different moves.  They must be done in the correct order on the card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending the Game:&amp;#10;After all 8 concerts have happened, everyone adds up their points (from Rest Stop and Concert Ticket cards).  The player with the most points wins the game.  That player is the Naked Brothers Band's Biggest Fan!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
