						               													<description>Nassor is a family game for 3 to 4 players for more than 10 years in which each player will have to manage a team of 2 archaeologists (2 meeples of the same color) whose objective is to travel through the desert starting from the initial town of Dair&amp;uacute; until find the golden city of Nassor. The archaeologists will move through the desert according to what we roll on the archaeologists die (8-sided die).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The desert is represented in 6 board modules that have an A and a B side, so the faces could be interchanged so that each game is different. The path to Nassor is made up of 96 squares, but if we use the shortcuts available on the map well, the journey will be shorter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the trip, we will find different types of boxes that will make getting to Nassor more complicated. In the brittle bridge squares we will think about whether it would be a good idea to cross them or not. In the event boxes, we will draw an event card, and we will apply it directly to the archaeologist who has fallen in the box, being able to advance, go back, meet an atlas lion or the fearsome curse of the Pharaoh. To solve these difficulties that we will find in the desert, we will roll the event dice (6-sided die) and, depending on the roll, we will be able to continue on our way or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If we want our archaeologists to be calmer, we can always land on an oasis square, in order to give them a break, or fall on a town square to roll the dice of the gods (20-sided dice) and be able to advance as much as possible. to reach our goal as soon as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to all the difficulties that the desert has prepared for us on our way, you will also have to be careful with the other archaeologists, since they will be able to capture you and send you to the previous town where you have been.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But this does not end here, in the desert the archaeologists will not be alone, Nassor's guardians will be lurking throughout the game for their own route hidden in the dense jungle, and if we coincide with them in adjacent squares, they will capture the archaeologists sending them to the dungeon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to survive and advance in the desert, the players will seek to fall with their archaeologists in the long-awaited power boxes, which will grant us one of the forty existing powers in the deck, all of them different, to use for our benefit or to harm the others. other players.&amp;#10;To end the game, you must reach the final square with your two archaeologists, at which point you officially declare yourself the discoverer of the golden city of Nassor and the winner of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With Nassor La Ciudad Dorada fun and interaction are guaranteed, but be careful, those who you considered friends could betray you for a handful of gold...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;LET THE ADVENTURE BEGIN!!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
