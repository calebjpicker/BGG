						               													<description>&amp;quot;The Original Rodeo Hexagame, a dice and bet game for the whole family&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In turn, each player competes in of 6 Rodeo disciplines, whilst the others place bets on the outcome. An active player can earn good money by successfully completing the task at hand, but the real money will be made by the onlookers who wager wisely.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cowboys who enter the hexagonal rodeo arena will be randomly assigned one of 6 events: Bull-Riding, Bronc-Riding, Barrel-Racing, Calf-Roping, Team-Roping or Steer-Wrestling. These typically are resolved by rolling a die and moving along a predetermined track until the active player completes the task, fails by landing on the wrong space in the races, or can't land on the required spot(s) before the cattle escapes out of the arena in the roping events.&amp;#10; The overall winner of the game will be the one with the most money at the end of it. Exactly when that is has to be decided by the players themselves, as events can be repeated as long as players are willing to enter them, and bet on them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since all the tasks get resolved by die rolling alone, winning cowboys will have been riding little more than their luck, making the Rodeo setting nothing more than a novel theme for a dice betting game, rather than simulating the adrenaline-rush of a genuine wild west gathering,  where skillful cowboys strut their stuff.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the upside, with detailed playing pieces and 6 different (and all short) events, your average dice betting game suddenly has become very atmospheric, reasonably varied, and does move on at a brisk pace. And even better, as players can keep betting during the races as long as they can find another player who takes them up on the counter-bet, bet money can move even faster than the bulls, triggering personal rivalry around the table that will make even the wildest rodeo-ride look tame in comparison.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This light-hearted simulation is aimed less at gamers and more at the family market, and the detail and simplicity of the rules will mean that it is probably most enjoyed by those with younger children to entertain. The suggested lowest age is 6, which might be a bit young to fully understand the complexities of even simple betting odds. There is no real upper limit to the amount of players that can join in, and the more the merrier the betting. But if all cowboys want their own piece, then 6 is the maximum number of entrants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
