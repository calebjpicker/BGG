						               													<description>Storyline:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scientists now knew it was the end of the world. They predicted that a scourge of natural disasters would hit the earth getting increasingly more dangerous until they wiped out all life on earth. The nation's government leaders came up with a solution to build a giant government facility larger than any structure on earth capable of withstanding these natural disasters and producing all the energy they needed to sustain human life. Taxes rose drastically that year as the nation's people raced to outpace the disasters and finish the massive project. It was finished with almost no time to spare but, that was when the government announced that the citizens who paid for the construction were not allowed to stay in the bunker. The now corrupt government even kicked citizens out of the main city and built a wall protecting it so that the government could hoard the cities valuable resources. You are in charge of a small group of survivors that were kicked out of the city and the disasters start tomorrow. Your only chance to survive the end of the world which is happening in only a few weeks is to break into the government facility and overthrow the government. In the meantime, though you will have to build makeshift bunkers using resources to protect yourself against natural disasters, get valuable provisions to keep your survivors alive, and repair weapons, vehicles, and tools to improve your chance of survival and help you defend yourself against other groups of survivors looking to overthrow the government before you do. This is Outpaced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: &amp;#10;Each round is split into three phases. Exploration, Fortification, and Catastrophe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the exploration phase players have 1 minute indicated by a timer to quickly roll dice that allow players to move around the city, collect resource cards from various locations, destroy gates that allow players to access more of the map, and make it back to their bunker before the timer runs out if players don&amp;rsquo;t make it back to the bunker in time they lose 1 of their five lives and all of their resources from the natural disaster that occurs in the catastrophe phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the fortification phase players take turns spending their resources to fortify their bunker, buy more dice, and/or craft builds like weapons, vehicals, and tools to gain an advantage in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the catastrophe phase players draw a disaster card. The disaster card weakens players bunkers and destroys various locations on the map effecting gameplay in the next round. If the disaster destroys your bunker you will also lose one of your 5 lives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Disasters will get increasingly harder every round until all players die or a player destroys all the gates on the map and breaks into the governments bunker in the center of the map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If more than one player makes it to the government facility it turns into a battle where the player that rolls the most combat dice wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
