						               													<description>In 2012, CPOP founder Neuicon unleashed his vision of a post-apocalyptic world called GRAXX, set in an alternate reality to ours, where the fantasy world of GROMM once flourished. The game would later become CPOP's flagship title and see a rise in popularity due to its many, many insane influences: thrash metal, synthwave, over-the-top violence, gore, horror, exploitation, action, fantasy and the post-apocalypse, all of which would be mashed up into a bad 80's Italian film and spew forth, the Toxic Holocaust, also known as the Goremageddon. Add to it, the ability to create gangs and every member of your gang from scratch, including their traits, weapons, equipment, abilities, spells, mutations, vehicles, the ability to see action on the very first turn and much, much more, and you have in your hands a game of maximum overdrive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An Overdose of Death! allows you to create a gang and every member in that gang from scratch (purchasing the unit's base rank, traits, abilities, equipment, weapons, mental or physical mutations, spells and more), play in three different modes (standard, boss and grudge), fight on battlefields in 2 by 2 to 4 by 4 feet in size, play a variety of scenarios and through several different battlefield conditions, field vehicles and totally customize your vehicles from scratch and much, much more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We welcome you to revisit the original second edition, originally released in 2012, along with everything ever released for the game, such as: Toxic Holocaust 2: An Overdose of Death! (introducing six factions: the Wasteland Warriors, Unholy Crux, Skravers, Reptors, Thermonuclear Warriors and Omega Corporation), Waste in Space: the Fatal Feast! (introducing two new factions: the Doom Legion and Prophets of Mars), Saalythic: Rise of Deraathis (introducing the Saalythic faction) and Black Inferno: the Raiders of Atlantis (introducing the Raiders of Atlantis faction).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Included with your purchase is a 1920 by 1080 HD wallpaper of An Overdose of Death!, so that you may adorn your screen with the madness of the Goremageddon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We welcome you to the Goremageddon. May you live, die and thrash.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goremageddon is heavily inspired by over-the-top violence, exploitation, gore, horror, humor and post apocalyptic films on the 1980s, as well as RetroWave and Thrash Metal music. Goremageddon is also CPOP's flagship project, made popular by a cult following and already headed into a third edition, due to release soon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
