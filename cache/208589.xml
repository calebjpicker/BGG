						               													<description>Villa Musara&amp;ntilde;as Great Race is going to start. Each school chooses a child to participate. What about you? Who are you going to run with?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME&amp;#10;Arrive at the finish line before your rivals. For this purpose you will have to overcome all kind of obstacles. First player who reaches 200 metres wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BOX CONTENTS&amp;#10;98 playing cards and 2 more cards with the rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CONTENTS TO PLAY&amp;#10;Cards, six-sided dice (take one of any other game or download an application on your smartphone browser that simulates one), notebook and pencil.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PREPARATION&amp;#10;The game can be played by any number of players from 2 to 6.&amp;#10;Write down in your notebook each one of the players in order to add the metres reached.&amp;#10;Divide the cards into three stacks:&amp;#10;1. Race (map-greens)&amp;#10;Overcome obstacles, dodge monsters and answer the wise men&amp;rsquo;s questions correctly to get metres in the race.&amp;#10;2. Equipment (open coffer-purples)&amp;#10;There are two kinds of objects:&amp;#10;Those ones that help to overcome obstacles (blues).&amp;#10;Those ones that are used for hindering the rest of runners (reds).&amp;#10;3. Runners (cup-yellows)&amp;#10;Each one of the runners has a physical skill (frog jump, lion strength, rabbit speed) that helps against monsters. There is also an intellectual one (language or mathematics) that helps to answer the wise men&amp;rsquo;s questions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CARD MANAGEMENT&amp;#10;Shuffle the three stacks separately.&amp;#10;Each player chooses a runner that is put face up on the table. The discarded cards are kept.&amp;#10;Deal four equipment cards to each player. It is necessary to keep them out of sight. You can never have more than four equipment cards in your hand. The unused cards are put face down at one side of the table.&amp;#10;The race stack is put face down in the middle of the table. The race starts when putting face up the first card of the stack. When the stack has no cards left, shuffle and put face down again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BEGINNING OF THE GAME&amp;#10;Roll the dice and the player with the highest score, starts playing. Each turn spins in a clockwise direction and starts showing a card of the race stack. Each card has a challenge with a score that must be overcome by rolling the dice. If you get it you get more metres or more equipment. If not, it is likely to lose metres (never under zero), equipment or the position. Each turn does not finish until each and everyone of the players try to overcome it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;STAGES IN EACH TURN&amp;#10;Each turn is divided into two stages:&amp;#10;1. Use of the equipment. You can use equipment cards only once.&amp;#10;2. Overcoming the challenge. In order to get it you will have to roll the dice and overcome the score of each challenge. It will be kept in mind if some equipment card has been used.&amp;#10;(Before starting each player&amp;rsquo;s turn, it will be also kept in mind if some equipment card has been used for hindering).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;END OF THE GAME&amp;#10;The player who reaches 200 metres wins Villa Musara&amp;ntilde;as Great Race Cup.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
