						               													<description>Oh Poo is not just another card elimination game.  Sure, you discard and pass cards, but you also get to flush and plunge them as well.  All you need to do to win is avoid being the player last to hold the Poo Card!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play Instructions:  Don&amp;rsquo;t get stuck holding the Poo!  Flush it, use the plunger, trick a fellow player into taking it off your hands... Keep it far away!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Getting Started: Shuffle the deck and deal out all cards. Some players may have an extra card compared to other players. That&amp;rsquo;s okay! Look at the cards you were dealt. If you have any two matching food card pairs discard them into a discard pile.   ***If you have three of the same cards, you discard two (one pair). If you have four of the same cards you can discard all four (two pair).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Don&amp;rsquo;t let any players see your cards that are not able to be discarded!  Keep them secret!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all players have discarded matching pairs, the youngest player goes first by drawing a single random card from the player on their right. Any new matching food card pairs, if a matching card was drawn, gets discarded right away and then the player on the right does the same, going around the table allowing each player to draw one card and discard pairs if able.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;            Anytime two food cards match they should be discarded. &amp;#10;        &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Plunger Card: If you have a Plunger Card you can play it at the beginning of your turn or at the very end of your turn. When you play a Plunger Card it gets discarded immediately and is removed from the game. Playing the Plunger Card switches the direction players draw cards from. If the table had been drawing cards from the player on their right, they would now switch to drawing cards from the player on their left. Anytime a Plunger Card is played the direction changes. There are only four Plunger Cards in the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Toilet Card: The Toilet Card never gets discarded, but can switch from player to player if randomly drawn. Whenever you have the Toilet Card and the Poo Card in your hand you can flush the Poo Card by giving it to any player of your choice. When flushing the Poo you have to show everybody you have the toilet card. You keep the Toilet Card in your hand after flushing the poo, as it could be drawn by the player drawing cards from you on their next turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Poo Card:  If you are left with no food cards in your hand and don&amp;rsquo;t have the Toilet Card, but are holding the Poo Card, you lose the game. OH POO!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Anytime you discard all your food cards and have no other cards in your hand during your turn, you are &amp;lsquo;out&amp;rsquo; and can sit back and watch the remaining players struggle to avoid being stuck with the Poo Card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
