						               													<description>You are at the helm in the fight for the future of the planet. Will you command the Alien Fleet or defend Humankind? Power up and scan the battlefield for locations to conceal your highly detailed, movie-based ships. Then, brace yourself for battle as electronic voice commands and sound effects signal your search-and-destroy mission to take out your opponent&amp;rsquo;s ships. Play on your own or battle a friend, and choose from three edge-of-your seat missions!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Deluxe Battleship Movie Edition has its gameplay based upon Battleship Advance Mission. There are three game modes: Classic game (One attack per turn), Multi-attack game (go again if you hit an enemy ship), Salvo game (make 1 attack for every ship you have in play). Deluxe mission also has two weapon modes: attack with only one coordinate at a time, or use advanced weapons that let you scan for enemies, shoot down enemy plans, or launch missiles for massive attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Differences from Battleship Movie Edition:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Has a computer, and adds search jets, and has a 10*14 field. The two player boards are joined in the middle. The ships are smaller and less detailed. Does not come with cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Identical to the Advanced Mission version, with the exception of alien ships, a lighter board, and and an alien voice instead of a female one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Green Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission differences from the earlier, blue box edition:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- improved voices and sounds (earlier said to be hard to understand)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the original game play in a bigger, 10 x 14, grid, Salvo mission, and Target Plus One Mission, or Bonus Mission.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- advanced weapons can now be used in Salvo and Bonus Missions&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the Attack Squadron planes now move and scan on the same turn, and the planes now scan the space immediately underneath them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the Aircraft Carrier missiles were eliminated. The Attack Squadron planes are equipped with a one-time use only missile that automatically hits every space where it detects an enemy target. It does that on the first target found only, and then it only scans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the Battleship has one Tomahawk missile that hits everything in the 3 x 3 square where it lands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the now-called Light Missile Cruiser has two Harpoon Missiles that covers three vertical or horizontal spaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the Fast-Attack Sub has two torpedoes that travel from one side to the other of the grid unless it hits a target first. The Sub also has a scanner that will tell you that an enemy ship is in the vicinity but will not tell you the precise location unlike the Attack Squadron Planes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the new design has a raised, inverted-Y design.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the ships are redesigned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-  there are different colored lights to indicated launches, scans, hits and misses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
