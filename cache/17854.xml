						               													<description>College Football simulates an entire NCAA football season. The players are not playing against one another, just recreating a season and participating in its progress.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A schedule is preset using twenty of the top college football teams (which can be chosen and ranked by the players). All other teams are represented by a generic &amp;quot;unranked&amp;quot; team. A season is then played out for the ranked teams. The game scores are based on the teams' rankings; the better a team is ranked, the more likely it is do score well and win. Each game takes only a few seconds to resolve (using a specially-created deck of cards), and a scoreboard for each week is created using the results of these games. After each week, the players vote on where each ranked team should be newly ranked (invariably dropping some of them from the rankings entirely), and a new set of rankings is generated prior to the next week's play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the season, the major bowl games are determined based on rankings and conference alignment, and then played to determine the final rankings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is an option for players to secretly select teams at the start of the season so that they are actually competing against one another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Betting is optional, either with the basic game or the variant, but a &amp;quot;modified mean&amp;quot; must be used in calculating the rankings to prevent players from skewing the results by ranking their own favorites unreasonably high.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Good for an afternoon of fun for the college football fanatic. Lots of math, though!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
