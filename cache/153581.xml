						               													<description>From the designer:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Awaken Destruction is a modern day card game that sets you and your dragon against other champions and their dragons, with the help of Government force, combat mechs, small armies and assassins as well as your own unique cards and abilities.  This is a war type fighting game utilizing cards and dice. Unique game mechanics, multiple target options, independent enemies and allies and battlefield teleportation makes AD an amazing card game experience to be enjoyed by hard core card gamers as well as the casual gamer alike.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Champion abilities are totally unique to the powers they have.  What does that mean? Take for example the blood champion, her power and power beasts cards will have different effects from those of different champions.  She has combo type power cards where as the water champion has evolution type power cards.  Another example is the fire champion having preload damage type power cards(Preload is a type of card where you use currency to determine the time or damage a card will perform before its played) where as the imagination champion will be very location specific.  All that to say, skilled play will be vital to winning, not just having the best cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Awaken Destruction will give you all the tools you need to build a great deck to start and you compete to make them stronger. There are no additional packs to buy after the initial purchase unless a champion update comes out. Your starter deck will have the maximum number of each card your champion can have and then you can tailor it down to your style of game play. There is no random card pack selling going on in AD. If a champion update is released, you will know every single card in that update before you buy it.  We feel this method allows players to spend more time playing and less time spending.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You haven't played a card game like this before. I never played TCGs prior to designing AD. When I created this, I had no idea what was already out on the market or what had come before me.  I created a game I felt would be very fun to play,  a skill based game that rewards a players abilitiy to think and adapt changing strategies as they play.  You are not out of this game just because you are down at the moment.  Cards and luck can change in an instant. Its kind of an emotional rollercoaster at times.  Ive been down and out for what I thought was a no win senario and the independant enemies came in and rocked the other player and gave me that little window of hope that I was able to use to finish the match.  On the other hand, I been in games where I thought I had it in the bag and and I few heals from killing bonuses and the other player was right back in the game, so you never really know how it's gonna turn out.  Which is why having the ability to adapt different play styles mid-game is going to be what seperates the good players from the great ones.      &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
