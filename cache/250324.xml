						               													<description>Published after an extended legal battle concerning the trademark and history of Monopoly, The Original Monopoly Games contains two different versions of the forerunner game to modern Monopoly compiled by professor Ralph Anspach. Also included is the &amp;quot;true and fascinating history of the Monopoly game.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Original, Long-suppressed monopoly game:&amp;#10;This is the genuine Atlantic City monopoly game, from which Monopoly was largely copied, and which was studiously ignored by the producers of Monopoly for forty years. Its existence was brought to light dramatically in a recent lawsuit by the makers of the Anti-Monopoly game. This historic Atlantic City game was created in 1930 by Quaker teachers as an improvement of an already exiting folkgame, which was also called monopoly. The Atlantic City folks, who until now have never gotten credit for inventing the world's most popular board game, played on il cloth board of the same kind supplied in our game- which can be rolled up, and presto, you have travel monopoly. Rid the time warp into the past and play on almost the same type of game equipment created by the real inventors of Monopoly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your Original monopoly game:&amp;#10;The forerunner monopoly folkgame had been played in Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and many other American cities since about 1910. The folkgamers enjoyed putting their won street, utility, a d railroad names on their game. We invite you to follow in their footsteps with the second board in our game equipment and the second set of black and white title cards. Pick the names which are most meaningful for you and mark them on your equipment, using either wipeoff or permanent black soft tip markers - or even crayons. BE CREATIVE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
