						               													<description>DON: CCE is a new collectible card game that allows two players to assume the roles of the head of a Criminal Organization vying for control of a major city. The Player Don uses a wide variety of Associates and Family Members to attempt to bankrupt his opponent. In addition to henchmen, a Don may play actions directly from his hand to affect either his own Associates or his opponent&amp;rsquo;s. The Don who bankrupts his opponent&amp;rsquo;s funds is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DON: CCE is set in a timeless world of crime, containing elements from the Prohibition era through the rise of the modern mob. This fantasy world of the Mafia is simulated to allow players to battle each other in a spirit reflective of classic Gangster movies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Player Dons use their tradable cards to generate funds, control vices and even whack their opponent&amp;rsquo;s Associates. Game rules are provided to play Sealed Deck, Double Sealed Deck and Constructed decks for use in tournament play, multiple player, and direct head to head competition. The Capo starter deck is available now.  The Capo booster packs, available in Summer 2003, will add a wealth of characters, actions, and possibilities to any game of DON: CCE. The complete card set at present contains over 200 separate cards representing everything from a lowly Babbo Crew to the powerful Made Men and the infamous Penitent Wife&amp;trade;.  The artwork is highly stylized to represent the classic gangster photos of yesteryear with hints of contemporary crime.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Using a revolutionary new game system, Dons are able to control cards in ways that other card games have never imagined. Each player&amp;rsquo;s actions control how many cards he wishes to deploy as well as how many funds he chooses to spend.  In DON: CCE, each Don controls his fate through strategy, not luck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Future expansions will add even more stylized elements of the genre, including more Law Enforcement, additional Associates, more Family members, and even more Vices for Dons to expand their &amp;ldquo;businesses&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
