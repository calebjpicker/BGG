						               													<description>Trivia board game with six categories of questions with three levels of difficulty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Board is a colorful circled labyrinth were you advance with correct answer to the question about history. First player to get in the middle circle with the correct answer from freely chosen category is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game has six categories of questions:&amp;#10;I: From ice age to space age (blue)&amp;#10;II: War and peace (red)&amp;#10;III: Science and art (green)&amp;#10;IV: King and peasant (yellow)&amp;#10;Silver: Hard questions from all fields&amp;#10;Gold: Very hard questions from all fields&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you answer correctly to the question from four basic categories, then you will move one space forward. Silver category is worth two moves and gold gives you three moves forward. You can always choose to answer silver or gold question, otherwise the colour of your current space determines the category of the question. With the correct answer you'll go on until you fail to answer correctly, then it's next players turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending of the game is triggered, when somebody answers correctly to chosen question in the middle circle. Current round is then finished, so that everybody has same amount of turns. If several players are tied, then extra questions are made until winner is decided.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
