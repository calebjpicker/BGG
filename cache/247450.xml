						               													<description>Card C-Quence is a light family speed game. It consists of a deck of 144 cards and a game board. This game is unique in that it only contains Hearts, Spades, and wild cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 20 cards face down. Players stack them in order without looking at them to form their &amp;quot;stockpile&amp;quot;. The Top card of the stock pile is turned face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is then dealt an additional 5 cards which form their hand. The remainder of the cards are placed in the center spot on the game board. The other 4 spots on the board are for community piles 2 for hearts and 2 for spades.  The player to the left of the dealer goes first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn you may play any number and combination of cards from your hand, stockpile, or discard pile to their respective community spaces on the board. Wild cards may be played in place of any card in matching suit. Community piles must start with the number 1 and build consecutively to the number 5.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a pile is completed place it to the side and start a new one. If you run out of cards in your hand immediately draw back up to 5.  When you play the top card of your stockpile turn up the next card. You may play a card as long as you have one available to play or until you choose to stop playing cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player also has their own separate discard piles one for hearts and one for spades. To end your turn you must discard one card to its respective discard pile. Play continues with then next player in a clockwise fashion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of your turn draw back up to 5 cards. If the draw pile runs out shuffle the completed community piles to form a new draw pile and place it in the center of the board. The first player to exhaust their stock pile scores 0 points. The other players score 1 point for each card left in their stockpile. When a player reaches 30 points the game ends. The player with the lowest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game may also be played in teams and requires 4 players. All rules remain the same except during you turn you may play from your partners stockpile and discard piles. You may not play from your partners hand. play continues until both players on the same team exhaust their stockpiles. Scores are kept by teams and not by individuals by adding the number of cards/points from both stockpiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Card C-Quence is a perfect mix of strategy and luck. Be the first to exhaust your stockpile and maintain the lowest score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
