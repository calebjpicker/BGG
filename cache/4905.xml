						               													<description>Have your M.U.S.C.L.E. characters battle against each other.&amp;#10;M.U.S.C.L.E Stands for &amp;quot;Millions of Unusually Small Creatures Lurking Everywhere.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A battle arena for your Muscles, with ten muscles!&amp;#10;Objective: Knock out all your opponent's muscles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the Game&amp;#10;1. Each player spins to see who goes first. The player who spins the higher number goes first.&amp;#10;2. Players take turns spinning the spinner and moving their M.U.S.C.L.E. creatures.&amp;#10;3. On each turn, a player spins the spinner, and them moves 1 or more of his creatures the same total number of spaces as the number just spun. A player can divide up his total move among as many creatures as he likes.&amp;#10;4. A player can move his creatures forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally in any combination.&amp;#10;5. A player can have up to 2 creatures on the same space at one time. You can move through a space with 2 of your creatures on it, but you can't stop there.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COMBAT&amp;#10;1. When you move one (or two) of you creatures onto a space occupied by one (or two) of your opponent's creatures, you begin a Combat.&amp;#10;2. During Combat, each player in turn spins the spinner once for each creature he/she has in battle. &amp;#10;3. After both players have spun, the one with the most &amp;quot;M's&amp;quot; wins the Combat and gets to knock over 1 or 2 of the opposing creatures.&amp;#10;4. Once knocked over, the defeated creatures are out of the game. Players leave defeated creatures lying on the arena, but those creatures are not counted as occupying space, and may be moved around as necessary to make room for more Combat.&amp;#10;5. If both players spin the same number of &amp;quot;M's,&amp;quot; the battle is a tie and will continue after the player takes his/her turn moving.&amp;#10;6. Once each player has had one chance to do battle on every space where his/her creatures are in Combat, it becomes the next player's turn to move. This player takes his/her turn moving even if there was a tie in the battle or if both players still have creatures standing on the same space after the battle.&amp;#10;7. Play continues for the rest of the game with one player taking a turn moving, then a Combat round (if there are any Combat situations on the board), then the other player takes his/her turn moving, and so on.&amp;#10;8. You can be involved in any number of Combats at one time.&amp;#10;9. The last player with one or more M.U.S.C.L.E. creatures left standing wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are stickers! You get a whole sheet of stickers with which  you can decorate your arena as well as your muscles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
