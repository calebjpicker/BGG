						               													<description>One part matching game, one part dominoes, plus loads and loads of fun, this game is both a clever challenge to hone memory skills and a make-your-own visual adventure of colorful play pieces. With the tour-de-force inventiveness which fuels his already-classics Press Here, Mix It Up!, and Let's Play!, Herv&amp;eacute; Tullet's open-ended game stimulates creative thinking and fosters imagination.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This open-ended game fosters creative thinking and imagination with lots of different ways to play. Here are a few to get you started.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MATCHING GAME: A clever memory challenge for 2 or more players&amp;#10;Spread the cards out color-side down in 4 rows of 11 cards each. The youngest player goes first and turns over 2 cards. If the pictures match, the player gets to keep the cards and take another turn. If the pictures don&amp;rsquo;t match, the player turns the cards back over, and it is the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn. Players take turns flipping the cards over and looking for matches. The game ends when all the cards have been matched. The player with the most matches wins. Note: For younger children, the game can be played with fewer cards; try 24 or 32 cards. For a more difficult game, spread the cards out not in rows but in a random pattern!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ROADBUILDER: Matching up lines for 2 to 4 players&amp;#10;Locate 1 of the black-and-white crossroads cards and place it in the center of the table. Each player picks 1 of the 4 sides of the card to build from. Place the remaining cards in the deck color-side down. Players take turns drawing a card from the deck and placing them on the table color-side up, matching up the lines to make as long a &amp;ldquo;road&amp;rdquo; as possible from their side. If a player reaches a dead end, he or she sits out the rest of the round. When no player can continue their &amp;ldquo;road,&amp;rdquo; all players collect the cards they&amp;rsquo;ve played and set them aside. Repeat, building new &amp;ldquo;roads&amp;rdquo; until all the cards are exhausted. The player with the most cards wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PATTERNGROWER: A collaborative visual adventure for 1 or more players.&amp;#10;This game should be played on the floor or another large surface, because the designs can get very big! Using both sides of the cards, players work together to make the largest possible design while still matching up all the lines. Try playing with all cards color-side up. Or try placing each fourth card black-side up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;See if you can come up with some variations of these games on your own!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
