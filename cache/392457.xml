						               													<description>In the year 1890, Brazil has just become a provisional republic. One of its goals is to keep the market thriving, and for that, goods from all over the country need to circulate more easily and in larger quantities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thus, a plan was created for the development of railway lines in Brazil, with the objective of connecting the new railway routes with the existing ones, as well as utilizing well-functioning river routes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The plan sparked interest from many companies, which led to significant investment and internal and external interferences. However, despite being one of the boldest plans that could theoretically improve freight transportation in the country, it fell into disuse. 1890: National Railways Plan is a game that brings to the table the experience of this plan, applied over three decades.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game that blends elements of 18xx with euro games, we are investors buying and selling shares of companies interested in investing in Brazil's railway lines. The stock market is constantly changing as it reacts to players' interactions with the market itself, as well as the development or lack thereof, of the companies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These companies, in turn, will buy trains, construct routes, collect revenues, and pay dividends to investors or not. Such crucial decisions will be made by their respective presidents, meaning the player who holds the highest percentage of the company in question.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner will be the one who can best manage the companies and manipulate the stock market, as the individual with the most money and the highest-value portfolio will be the victor of 1890.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
