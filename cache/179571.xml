						               													<description>Card game played with traditional deck of cards, with some small elements of poker.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck is divided in two: Red Cards &amp;amp; Black Cards.&amp;#10;One player takes all the black cards, while the other takes all red cards. They will each play with their own deck throughout the whole game - never mixing them.&amp;#10;Players will separate the face cards (J, Q, K) and keep them in their hands at all times. The rest are shuffled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both players will pick 3 cards from their own shuffled deck.&amp;#10;Immediately after, they will choose to play either Queen or King as their &amp;quot;Warlord&amp;quot; for that round. They will place 1 Queen or 1 King face down and reveal them at the same time.&amp;#10;If a player has chosen a Queen, they can (but are not obligated to) discard 1 card from their hand and take 1 new one from their deck.&amp;#10;If they have chosen a King, they can do this up to 3 times.&amp;#10;The face card is kept in front of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now it's time for battle.&amp;#10;Each player selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. They then reveal the card at the same time and lay it in front of them.&amp;#10;This is done until the three cards have been played.&amp;#10;The player with the highest ranking 'combo' wins the battle. Combos are valued similarly to poker, but only with 3 cards. Below is the ranking order:&amp;#10;1.   3 of a kind&amp;#10;2.   Straight (3 numbers in consecutive order)&amp;#10;3.   Flush (same suit)&amp;#10;4.   2 of a kind&amp;#10;5.   Card (highest number)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winning player will take the defeated player's warlord and put it aside as a trophy.&amp;#10;Game ends when one of the players runs out of warlords.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can use their Jacks to surrender in a battle. Jacks can be played instead of a number card (with the same behavior - keeping it hidden until both players reveal their card).&amp;#10;If a player surrenders with a Jack, he/she will lose all the number cards he/she has already laid down (not the ones in his/her hand), plus the Jack that triggered the surrender. But he/she will save their warlord.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If there is a draw during battle (or two players play a Jack), nothing happens. Players take their corresponding cards and continue to the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must shuffle all their number cards after every round (except for the ones they have lost, of course).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
