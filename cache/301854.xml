						               													<description>The two Myrmidons sprinted across the open field and up the cargo ramp, disappearing into the alien cargo ship. The assault team rushed across the open ground and secured a perimeter around the entrance. There were a few flashes of light from deep inside the transport followed by muffled cracks. The radio crackled to life in Carter's ear and a deep voice whispered, &amp;quot;Cargo Bay Secured. Proceeding with Sweep.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Sierra, Golf. Rally.&amp;quot; Master Guns' voice boomed over the radio. &amp;quot;Echo, secure this ramp. Eightball, Lucky sweep to the bridge and secure it. Oscar, Victor, with me to engineering.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;Carter and Parker rose up from their covered and concealed position and raced across the open field as fast as they could carrying all of their gear and cumbersome weapons. Their boots squelched in the mud and slowed their progress. Carter's thighs were burning nicely by the time they hit the metal cargo ramp of the alien transport ship. Carter broke left and took cover behind a piece of metal reinforcing rib, while Parker broker right and took up a covering position behind another metal rib. Echo was pulling apart a section of wiring and clipping his black box to it. Echo typed away on the keypad built into his thigh armor. Carter guessed he was trying to hack the craft's control system so they could close the ramp.&amp;#10;The voices of the other team members occasionally whispered or boomed into his earpiece and filled his helmet with information. Giving him something of a shorthand version of the engagement going on inside the ship. The two Myrmidons, Eightball and Lucky, were almost to the bridge while Master Guns and his team where sorting out a brief firefight in a passageway deep within the ship.&amp;#10;While he was listening in he was scanning the right rear of the ship and noticed something in the treeline. &amp;quot;Movement five o clock, two zero zero meters.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Roger, almost to engineering.&amp;quot; Master Guns boomed over the muffled sounds of a firefight.&amp;#10;Just as he said that, the metal around Carter began popping and sending small amounts of spalling whipping around the cargo bay. Echo grunted and went down next to him. Blood was starting to spread around his armor plates and Echo began cursing fluently in spanish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 scenarios integrated into the story of Zulu 15, the Frigate &amp;quot;Trident&amp;quot; and the search for the Ghost Worlds during the Siege of Terra.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
