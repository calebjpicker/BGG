						               													<description>In Frontier Valley you will hire workers, learn about their abilities and employ them as farmers to produce goods on your land, as craftsmen to make the building material you buy with your produce and as townsfolk to make use of your new facilities. You will need to make sure to make good use of the land so you are the player to better satisfy the market's demands. But beware: one misjugded applicant, one thoughtless land lease or one greedy building project could be all that is needed for the luck to turn towards your opponent!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Frontier Valley is a two-player 18 card game of deduction, market manipulation, building structures and powerful one-time actions. Each round you choose one worker card from your hand to use. This might sound easy, but as in Hanabi, you do not see your own cards, only the ones of your opponent, so make sure you make the right pick even when you do not have perfect information! You then use this worker as farmer to plant new crops and thus changing the price of produce on the market, as builder to erect new structures (if you can sell valuable goods) that bring victory points or as townsfolk to use powerful one-time actions on your already standing buildings. Then you will have to give your opponent some hints of her choosing toward the cards in her hand. Will you manage to outsmart your opponent by manipulating the supply of farming goods such that you always have the most valuable produce? Will you be able to hire a sought after seasoned architect to build the most impressive town buildings? Whoever has the buildings with the most victory points in total will be the winner of Frontier Valley.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game features a beginner mode for learning the interactions of hints, the type of workers there are and the market dynamics. Once you played this at least once, feel free to add the one-time actions of townsfolk to the game for added complexity and challenge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
