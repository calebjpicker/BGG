						               													<description>The bankers just received a call from the police of the Greenwick District. It appears there are robbers disguised as bankers for months now and are planning to rob the bank today!Will the banker stop the robbers in time, or allow the robbers escape freely with all the hard earned money from the citizens of Greenwick District.Bankers and Robbers is a social and logical deduction card game for 5-8 players, takes up to 30 minutes of game time and is suitable for players age 14 and above.The game is split into 2 phases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Phase 1) Each player will be given a character card. Each player will either be playing the role of a banker or a robber.In every game there will only be 2 robbers and the remaining players will all be bankers. Each player will be assigned a number from 1-8 and will take turns taking a number token from the token bag. Each player will be able to perform 1 of 2 actions to the player shown by the number token.They can either give the player a gun card or a key card.The turn sequence continues until the the end of every third round, whereby there will be a swap action performed.Any player to receive 3 gun cards will be immediately eliminated from the game.A Robber player can choose to use 2 key cards to reveal an identity of another player holding 2 key cards.Any player can choose to use 3 key cards to take a peek at a players card of his or her choice(if the role of the chosen player differs from their own character,take a gun card).Any player can choose to use 4 key cards to reveal a chosen players card to the public.Any player to receive 5 key cards will need to immediately discard all their key cards and gun cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Phase 2) Each player will need to race from the start to the end. The player who reach the end point first will win the game.Each player moves by either choosing to use a move step card or by rolling a dice. At the end of the round,only 1 player will be shot for being behind another player from the opposing team.A banker player will be eliminated by receiving 3 gun cards in phase 2 of the game.A robber player will be eliminated by receiving 6 gun cards in phase 2 of the game.Key cards will act as gun cards in phase 2 of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The bankers goal in phase 1 is to eliminate all robber players before they manage to escape to phase 2 of the game,hence win the game.The robbers goal in phase 1 is to find his or her partner by performing a reveal on another player and if successful, both robber players will escape to phase 2 of the game.The bankers and robbers goal in phase 2 is to have any player from their team reach to the end point first before the opposing team or to eliminate all players from the opposing team.Whichever team completes phase 2 first will win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
