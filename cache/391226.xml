						               													<description>Corporate Onboarding is a solo journaling game all about navigating corporate bureaucracy. Players use a standard deck of cards and two six-sided dice to create an evolving map of their new office as they try to find the six bosses they need to report to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Along the way, they will encounter random events in rooms that are generated based on their cards and dice rolls. These will impact how they play the game and how quickly they can achieve success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can also be reprimanded by HR and will need to deal with the reprimands as they arise - if they fail to do so adequately they will end up with a warning. If a player receives five warnings they are fired and lose the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Corporate Onboarding includes two A4 tri-fold pamphlets (that can be printed at home) and is based on the Firelights game system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
