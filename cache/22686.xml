Vassal is not a complex computer game that must be learned. Instead, it shows you the game board and pieces, and you get to move them around as if in a face-to-face game with another player. This means you do not have to spend hours learning how to use a computer game. You simply move the pieces around the on-screen board as if you were sitting across the table from another player. As you make your moves, the other player sees your moves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vassal includes a Chat system to keep you in contact with your opponents. A Vassal game includes all the maps, counters, automated die rollers, and card decks you need to play the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
