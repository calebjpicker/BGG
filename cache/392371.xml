						               													<description>Bangkok's Chatuchak market, with its colorful tent booths, is one of the world's biggest markets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have the task to group the market booths better by market segments like decoration, cloths, furniture, plants or food.&amp;#10;Each player manages a section of the market area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To group the booths in their section better, players want to rearrange booths. But you can relocate booths only as long as they stay along the same alley!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your own market section has booths along 4 horizontal and 5 vertical alleys, so it has 5 rows and 6 columns of booth spots.&amp;#10;One of the spots in your 5x6 grid is empty, the other 29 spots have a booth and each booth belongs to 1 out of 5 market segments.&amp;#10;In each turn you move 1 booth horizontally or vertically to the empty spot, so to the spot where your last-moved booth came from.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For victory points players try to reach goals better than their opponents. There are 12 goals to compete for, like having 1 of the 5 market segments grouped the best, or having 2 specific market segments connected the best, or having the longest straight path with 1 market segment or the biggest rectangular area with 1 market segment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These goals bring you a victory point when you reach it first, if you take over from another player, and if you have the lead at end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The number of turns players have, depends on the progress at the time track. So that you can assess, but can't know, the remaining number of turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
