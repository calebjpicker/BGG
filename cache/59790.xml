						               													<description>The players at a table and the talliere in the midst of them, with the bank of gold (GG). The players each having 13 cards. Each lay down one, two, three, or more, as they pleased, with money upon them. The talliere took the pack in his hand and turned them up, with the bottom card appearing. He then paid half the value of the stakes upon any card of that sort.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The talliere then proceeded with his deal and the next card won for the player go on to sept-et-le-va. The card after that won for the talliere took money from each player's card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The talliere, if the winning card was a king, and the next after it was a ten, said: 'King wins, ten loses,' paying the money to such cards and taking the money from those who lost, adding it to his bank. After that he went on with the deal: 'Ace wins, five loses; 'Knave wins, seven loses;' and so on, every other card alternately winning and losing, till all the pack was dealt but the last card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;According to the rules of the game, the last card turned up was for the advantage of the talliere; although a player might have one of the same sort, still it was allowed to him as one of the dues of his office, he paid nothing on it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
