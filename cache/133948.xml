						               													<description>A turn based tactics strategy game pitting two armies against each other for total dominating victory. The last one standing is the victor. Armies consist of units that range from a wide range of factions, including circus performers, fairies and the undead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game begins with an always changing battlefield and a win/lose condition being selected, such as last one standing or capture the flag. Players then take their fully customized armies and deploy their units one at a time, alternating players between each unit to ensure both offensive and defensive lineups. When the deploy is completed, players alternate activating each of their units, moving and attacking, to try to reach the win condition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each unit has their own critical stats, such as Attack value, Defensive value, movement value, attack grids and inherent powers. To stop overpowered armies, associated costs are also attached to each unit to put a cap on army limits. Strategy doesn't lie in the most powerful units, it lies in picking the right units for your army and how to position them best counter your opponent's strategies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ultimately, he idea behind Rumble Tactics is a tactics strategy game that is affordable, portable, and customizable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;AFFORDABILITY: the game in its core is and will always be free to play by making it &amp;quot;print and play&amp;quot;. If fancier cards and tokens are requested, for example, DIY solutions are available.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PORTABLE: The Unit Tokens are 1&amp;quot; in size and a standard battlefield is no larger than a piece of 8.5 x 11 paper. With the addition of a handful of Unit Cards and d6, you've got a game that you can take anywhere and play at even the smallest of restaurant tables.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CUSTOMIZABLE: Through both the BGG site and Rumble Tactics site, all of the rules, cards, and tokens will be available in many graphic formats so players can create their own units. Want an army full of cows that shoot lasers? Why not. As long as you and your friends/opponents agree on the units, the possibilities are endless.  There's even a handy spreadsheet to input values (attack, defense, etc.) that will calculate the COST of each unit, making it as fair as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Come join the fun and fill the ranks of Rumble Tactics!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
