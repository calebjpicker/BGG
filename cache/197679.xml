						               													<description>Chaos reigns in the wake of the king's death. People are starving, the roads are dangerous to travel and the nation's foreign enemies have begun to stir at the borders. The kingdom cries out for a new ruler - and you are the head of a minor house who intend to answer that call... if you can do so before your adversaries take what should be yours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now is your chance. Restore order under your rule and claim the throne for yourself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Crown of Exile players compete to seize control of a kingdom at the verge of a dark age while guarding themselves from opponents with ambitions of their own, and underhanded ways of interfering.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crown of Exile is a game for 2-5 players that takes 90 minutes to play. The rules are simple to learn but offer a depth of strategy that will keep both experienced gamers and newcomers scheming and plotting over and over again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crown of Exile is a game about developing your domain and deciding when you have built enough to risk taking on quests. Move too quickly and your opponents might interfere, leaving you unable to fulfill your quests, but move too slowly and someone else will take what could have been yours. You can be an aggressor and try to steal what others have as a means to victory, subtly manipulate the flow of the game with political influence, or trade to gain enormous resources quickly, but give your rivals the opportunity to profit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Crown of Exile players begin with a hand of cards representing their domain - a treasury, serfs, nobles, and infantry, they also begin with a knight and a construction card. Unlike other deckbuilding games Crown of Exile gives you access to all of your drafted cards, but limits players to only four each round, forcing players to balance generating resources versus expansion and conquest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round players will use four of their cards to generate resources, attack, trade, draft new cards and complete quests that will grant them various bonuses, including titles and victory points needed to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once completed, quests require you to pay an upkeep cost to maintain the order and control you have established, and keep the advantages provided by those quests. So as you gain power and complete more quests your resources will become strained- and your opponents may attempt to sabotage you and try to steal your quests by preventing you from gaining the necessary resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of every round players pay their upkeeps and gain bonuses based on their titles and quests and then pick up all of their cards and begin another round. Play continues until one player has achieved the rank of &amp;quot;Prince&amp;quot; or 8 rounds have elapsed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
