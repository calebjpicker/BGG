						               													<description>Le Grisbi is a friendly, family-friendly card game whose references immerse you in the world of French cinema, each game combining luck and strategy!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With easy intergenerational references, anyone can play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And why not end up watching the films mentioned together? But the winner chooses!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 deck of 53 cards will allow up to 5 players to play,&amp;#10;2 decks, up to 9&amp;#10;etc...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Le Grisbi is made up of 53 game cards and 3 double-sided rule cards.&amp;#10;The 53 cards in the game are divided into 2 categories:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     40 numbered cards (4 series of cards ranging from 1 to 10)&amp;#10;     13 special cards (with super powers)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with 3 cards face down in front of them covered with 3 cards face up and 3 cards in their hand. The rest of the cards serve as a draw pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player begins by putting on the table one or more cards of the same value located in her hand. At this point she must draw the number of cards sufficient to have at least three cards in her hand. The next player must put one or more cards of equal or greater value than the previous number card and draw accordingly and so on. If he cannot play or if tactically he finds it more interesting, the player recovers the game pile and starts a new pile. As long as there is a draw pile all players must have at least 3 cards in hand. Otherwise a player can say &amp;quot;Grisbi&amp;quot; and designate the person who does not have 3 cards in hand and this person will have to recover the game pile. The player who said &amp;quot;Grisbi&amp;quot; starts playing again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the draw is completed, players play all the cards they have in their hand. When it is done, the player can recover his new deck by taking the cards face up located in front of him. He plays as before until he has no more cards.&amp;#10; Then, on the third phase, the player, when it is his turn, turns over a card face down at random and places it on the pile. If the played card remains in the rule, the game continues and it is up to the next player. If the placed card does not respect the rule, the player takes the playing pile back into hand and must get rid of it before moving on to the next face down card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first to get rid of all his cards wins and the game ends when there is only one player left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
