						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;The Fortress of Louisbourg was one of the largest fortifications the French constructed in North America . . . Louisbourg was destined to fall to a New England army in 1745 and a professional British Army in 1758.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;The 1745 siege was conducted by an army raised by the colonial governments of New England who raised, equipped, supplied and transported their army to Louisbourg in the summer of 1745. They only had some naval help from the British. This army of farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen were able to defeat and capture an important French settlement.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The siege of 1758 was as a result of the British Government's strategy of weakening France by capturing her overseas Empire. A British army of 15,000 soldiers and sailors was dispatched from Britain to Halifax, Nova Scotia to train and then launch an attack on the Fortress. The French this time were ready for an invasion and had prepared beach defenses. However, the British were still able to land and after a seven week siege, the French surrendered. The French commander had achieved his objective of delaying the British advance on Quebec for another year.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A miniatures wargame intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on a 2x1 meter table using 1/72 scale miniature figures. Free print-and-play paper miniatures are also provided for use with the rules, as well as a print-and-play castle to be used for the fortress.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game covers a small area of the siege, near a gate and bastion. A wet moat protects a portion of the fortress by the gate. The only units involved in the sieges are infantry and artillery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
