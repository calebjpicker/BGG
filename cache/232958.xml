						               													<description>BrazChess is a Chess-like game that combines in its design several elements found in other games of its kind (like Modern Chatranj, Makruk, Shogi and FIDE Chess) along with brand new ideas to provide a unique experience to the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pieces are weaker than in FIDE Chess, but stronger than in Modern Shatranj and Makruk - so the game fits as another bridge between these games and regular Chess. Even though the game has the same number of pieces that there is in Chess (32), there is a slightly greater variety of them in BrazChess (8 against 6 in Chess). Some of the &amp;quot;parachuting&amp;quot; that occurs in Shogi is present (regarding the movement of Grand Dukes - a promoted Pawn); you'll also find different forms of capturing (suicidal attacks and the Grand Duke's Zone of Control). Also present is the concept of passing your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What you need to play it:&amp;#10;In order to play BrazChess, you will need:&amp;#10;A) The rules (see Files);&amp;#10;B) A Modern Chess board (8x8) and Pieces (you'll need to either paint the heads or bases of two Pawns from each side, or use some other Pieces to represent the 2 Lords from each side). Note that the starting position of some pieces (like the Rooks) is different than in regular Chess;&amp;#10;C) 6 different pieces, coins, tokens or even checkers pieces (for the promoted Pawns aka Grand Dukes);&amp;#10;D) 1 tokens to represent Passing; &amp;#10;E) An auxiliary board (the Duchy) or a designated space on the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The creation of this game was inspired by Chatranj, Modern Chatranj, Makruk, Shogi, Chess/Orthochess (FIDE Chess) and the book &amp;quot;Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&amp;quot; - by D. B. Pritchard. While it is true that there are several Chess-like games like this in the World, Chess is, itself, a variant of an older game, that was already a variant of an even older game. BrazChess, while definitely a member of the Chess family of games, has many unique features that will certainly deliver a different experience than the other games of its kind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
