						               													<description>Warblog offers over 500 print and play modern war hex and counter games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game covers 1945 to date period with current wars covered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many of the games offer exceptional replay-ability, whilst some are simply to analysis and learning.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With over 500 games, there are games to suit most timeframes. You can find small games that might only take 30 minutes to play, but you can play it multiple times, playing for the best of three or best of five. Other games could be described as monster games that will literally take a very long time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A key feature of the system is its simplicity. They games are designed for people that have a penchant for moving the counters about and not having to wade through large rule sets. Further, as the games are mostly situational, ie not operational, lines of supply and command are not critical, although some games do offer leader units and there are leader rules. The game has been designed to be failsafe from the ground up. This means you just move the counters about, observing movement allowances and terrain etc, but if you don't understand surround rules or terrain defence effects, its not that important, just play anyway. But if you want to tighten things up, there is a deep set of mechanics, including unit mix/matching, that is gaining a bonus for armour versus infantry stacks with no armour or mechanised etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes all unit types including air and sea units with a wide range of additional units types for air defence, insurgents and irregular activity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scenarios are all historic and players are encouraged to learn their history and to even criticise the orders of battle and terrain arrangements as doing so is only further developing your own historical understanding and helping the War Blog team to help other people similarly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scenarios also encompass current events, so if you have an interest in following world events you can use War Blog to do so.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many of the scenarios included are largely unstudied and certainly not common knowledge, and this whole library of scenarios is always on the increase with scenarios being updated with new intelligence and new scenarios added.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is currently under development and the rule set could well branch out to encompass features not covered on the online version which can readily be added to a paper based procedural rule set, for example, hidden movement and political intervention. Further, experienced players are encouraged to add their own rules up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many of the scenarios are unbalanced and there mainly for situational analysis, for example, in a educational environment. However, even in situations where a player might not stand a chance of winning, players can set house scoring based on how long a player could hold out and how they play in comparison to the historical timeline.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
