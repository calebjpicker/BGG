						               													<description>It is now 2017, one hundred years since the United States entered the First World War on the side of the Allies in one of the most unnecessary and wasteful wars ever fought.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The research required almost got in the way of the game system, with diagrams and illustrations. Consequently after system, with diagrams and illustrations. Consequently after many rewrites it was decided to create one book as a game system and another as a simple note book. Both over lap each other. It did seem necessary to describe the tactical techniques in some great detail. Fortunately there is plenty of information on how these weapons were used on the battlefield. This availability of information made it possible to transform information into a realistic game system. However incomplete as it may be, the rules still effectively cover only a small part of the late ground war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game system includes supportive diagrams, illustrations, tactical notes and Quick Reference Sheets (Q.R.S.). The Turn Sequence and Turn Phases, once understood, make play easy and fast. The system has two Turn Sequences one of which is optional and the other mandatory. Six basic Turn Phases move the game along to a conclusion. Manufacturers will be glad by the fact that the game is best played using lots of figures and models. Let us be glad that there are sources for figures and models.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Basic units are 12 figures for a platoon with four platoons making a company and three to four companies making a battalion. Figures can be mounted individually or on multiple stands. Morale is based on unit size and applicable modifiers. Movement is with a D-10 die roll for both infantry and tanks. Transport and field artillery movement is determined by the roll of a D-6. There are two Turn Phases in which players can shoot. Hand-to-hand combat is easily performed. Players are always encouraged to adjust the rules to suit their perceptions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To me, Yanks and Tanks captures the flavor of the late war. I hope your games will be hard fought, yet fun, and the game system competes well with other similar systems.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
