						               													<description>PolitSABOTAGE is a role-playing business game, where players can practice communication, public speaking and bluff recognizing skills.&amp;#10;The Goal of the Game: Players are Members of the Parliament (MP). &amp;#10;Every player secretly receives a card with a role, resulting in 2 commands: Coalition and Opposition. Players  have to communicate with each other, compete for the Chairman position and debate to ensure that their team wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The MPs  without powers play until the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-&amp;#10;Requires: 6-16 players (best 10) and a Game Master (GM). &amp;#10;-&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The GM, players, teams, roles and goal of the Game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game requires the GM, who does not have a playing role. They monitor the playing time, announce the beginning and the end of game actions, treat all players impartially and monitor compliance with the rules (see the sections &amp;laquo;Forbidden in the Game&amp;raquo; and &amp;laquo;Sanctions&amp;raquo;), settle conflicts between players and impose sanctions (if necessary). In case of a dispute on the correctness / fairness of the GM's actions, they must be supported by 3 players (at least).&amp;#10;The players (6-16 people) get the Role Cards. Then they are divided into two teams in a random manner:&amp;#10;- Coalition team (the players with the Coalition Supporter and Intelligence Agent Role Cards);&amp;#10;- Opposition team (the players with the Oppositionist and Head of the Opposition Role Cards).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Goal of the Game is to ensure victory for your team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Roles in the game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) Coalition Supporter - during the Parliamentary Days, must find members of his team (they are unknown to him at the beginning of the game), as well as find and force all members of the Opposition team to give up powers.&amp;#10;2) Intelligence Agent - has the same powers as the Coalition Supporter, but additionally has the power at Parliamentary Night to find out from the GM who is the member of the Opposition, and for this reason he has to hide his role from the Opposition.&amp;#10;3) Oppositionist - should join forces with other members of his team (they know them at the beginning of the game) in order to avoid the exposure of the members of his team; besides, they have to discredit (the same thing as forcing to resign) as well as to confuse and embroil each other and force the members of the Coalition team to resign during Parliamentary Nights and Days.&amp;#10;4) Head of the Opposition - has the same powers as the Oppositionist, but additionally at the Parliamentary Night they determine whom the Opposition will deprive of powers, and they also have the power at Parliamentary Night to find out from the GM who is the Intelligence Agent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Game stages, players&amp;rsquo; statuses, game ending&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game is divided into two stages:&amp;#10;- Parliamentary Night (or break of the Session, the Night before the First Session etc.). The stage when the Oppositionists secretly discredit (deprive of powers) the Coalition Supporters, the Head of the Opposition tries to find out the Intelligence Agent, and the Intelligence Agent tries to find out information about the Role of the players. The rest of the players are resting (i.e. sitting at the game table with their closed eyes).&amp;#10;- Parliamentary Day (or Plenary Day or the First Session of the new Parliament etc.). The stage of open voting for the Chairman (of the Parliament), debates, finding out of the Oppositionists and deprivation of powers of MPs (players).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Players&amp;rsquo; statuses:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Chairman - is a majority-elected player (regardless of the role on the card) who gains power for one Parliamentary Day in order to find out and deprive the powers of one player they consider Oppositionist. They are also immune from the actions of the Opposition on the coming Parliamentary Night.&amp;#10;The MP with powers (initially all players have this status) - the number is side &amp;laquo;A&amp;raquo; to other players, speech time: 1 minute and the right to vote for the Chairman.&amp;#10;The MP without powers (this status appears for a player after the deprivation of powers) - the number is side &amp;laquo;B&amp;raquo; to other players, speech time: 30 seconds and deprived of the right to vote for the Chairman.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Sanctions (penalty system) reduce the playing time (see below)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Game Ends with the victory of one of the teams:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- the Coalition team wins if all members of the Opposition team are deprived of their powers&amp;#10;- the Opposition team wins if the number of the Opposition players is equal to the number of the Coalition players&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
