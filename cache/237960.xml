						               													<description>Death by Cantaloupe&amp;#10;Ideal for 2-4 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal: Be the first player to reach exactly 100 points using any combination fruits/points&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Card Types: (1) PENALTY cards are the Cantaloupe cards and MUST be cleared by penalized player before putting down points towards goal (2) Crazy Coconut cards can wipe out penalty cards immediately (3) Fruit cards each have point values of 5, 10, and 15 and are used to reach the 100-point goal or clear a penalty card&amp;#10;To Start: Shuffle all cards.  Deal each player 6 cards and put the remaining cards face down in a draw pile. EACH PLAYER WILL ALWAYS KEEP 6 CARDS IN THEIR HAND.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play: Player 1 draws a card and makes a decision to either (1) put down a point card face up to add towards the 100-point goal OR (2) put down a PENALTY Death by Cantaloupe card on another player OR (3) discard and play nothing. Player 1 will still have 6 cards in hand when turn is over and it is the next player&amp;rsquo;s turn to draw a card and play.  At the end of each turn, the player will always have 6 cards in their hand.  The first player to have EXACTLY 100-points face up in front of them wins.  If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile and turn over to start a new draw pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Exception to Drawing a Card: If a player has a PENALTY Death by Cantaloupe card played on them, the combination of fruit cards MUST be placed down (one turn at a time) to clear the penalty.  The fruit combination can be from the player&amp;rsquo;s hand of cards or from their existing points pile (therefore reducing their point total).  IF A FRUIT CARD IS MOVED FROM THE FACE UP POINT TOTAL IN FRONT OF A PLAYER, THEY DO NOT DRAW A CARD AND THEIR TURN IS OVER.  The player still has 6 cards in their hand.&amp;#10;Death by Cantaloupe PENALTY: There are 6 penalty cards that have 2-fruit combinations and 6 penalty cards that have 3-fruit combinations.  Penalty cards must be face up with each card that clears it next to it.  When the penalty is cleared all cards go into the discard pile.  Only 1 card per turn can be played and NO point cards toward the 100-point goal can be played by the penalized player until the penalty is cleared.&amp;#10;Crazy Coconut: The Crazy Coconut instantly wipes out a penalty cantaloupe card.  The Death by Cantaloupe card and the Crazy Coconut cards (and any point cards already put down towards the penalty) go into the discard pile.  The player will still have 6 cards in their hand when turn is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
