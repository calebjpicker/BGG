						               													<description>Chroma Arcana is a tactical card game set in an Arabian fantasy world. Players take on the roles of powerful mages, using their knowledge of the arcane arts to outmanoeuvre and defeat their opponents. Each mage has access to a unique combination of spells based on their chosen colours of magic, allowing for a diverse range of gameplay options and strategies. The goal of the game is to reduce your rival's health to zero. On your turn, you can place spell cards into your spellbook. Then, you can discard cards of a matching colour to charge those spells up. Once a spell is charged up, it must be cast.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Spells can be instant-effect Glyphs, Minions that provide a benefit for a handful of turns, Hexes that link to other spells in the game, or trap-like Wards that remain until their trigger condition is met.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are also item cards that you play straight from your hand, such as Potions that counter rival spells or Arcana that super-charge your own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of setup, you will have selected an Ego (your character identity), a Main Colour (along with a powerful Sigil and a well-practiced Rote), and two Secondary Colours. This should be all you need to battle it out!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
