						               													<description>Counterblast: Adventure Battle Game is a miniature skirmish game with a 1920s-'30s space pulp feel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the game's intro pdf:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;COUNTERBLAST Adventure Battle Game is miniatures combat set in a retro-inspired Sci-Fi universe where each player commands heroes (or villains) referred to as solos and their companions (or henchmen) referred to as teams. Together, solos and teams form a crew. Players deploy their crews (usually according to scenario rules) and roll a die to determine who will be the &amp;ldquo;first player&amp;rdquo; at the start of the game. The highest number rolled (re-rolling any ties) is the &amp;ldquo;first player&amp;rdquo;. Each round the &amp;ldquo;first player&amp;rdquo; shifts, switching back and forth in a two player game and clockwise in a game of three or more players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The game is played over one or more rounds where each player will have the opportunity to activate and perform actions with each member of their crew. Crew members are activated in order of initiative (highest to lowest). In the case of a tie the &amp;ldquo;first player&amp;rdquo; that round activates one crew member and when done the next player activates a crew member with that same initiative and so on until all crew members for all players with that initiative have been activated. Once all crew members have had a chance to perform actions the round is complete and a new one begins. Crew members may choose to hold their actions until a later point during the round. Activation of crew members that held their actions may be done between any later activations that round. In the case of more than one player wishing to activate a crew member that held their action the &amp;ldquo;first player&amp;rdquo; gets first choice and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Once activated a crew member may not choose to perform one action and save the other. Any unused actions are lost.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
