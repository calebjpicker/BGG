						               													<description>The Fairies are having their Fair, and it's exactly as magical as it sounds! What's not so magical is the intense planning that goes into making the annual event a success. This year, the fairies have turned to YOU, fair impresario extraordinaire, to bring together all the elements needed for the grand occasion. Fail, and you'll let down not only the fairies, but all the kids of the various assorted fantasy races who have been looking forward to this magical night all year long.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fairy Fair is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write game that takes place in the Legends of Dsyx fantasy setting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player will roll dice to build various stalls and attractions inside a grid representing the fair grounds. Don't like what you've rolled? Roll again! Unlike in most roll-and-write games, players have UNLIMITED rerolls to make sure they get the fair just right. Unlimited, that is... until doubles come up, at which point the turn immediately ends without the chance to build anything at all. Sorry, but life isn't &amp;quot;fair!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the time track representing the approach of opening night is completely filled in, however, is when the games -- and game -- REALLY begins. Now, the player must guide the revelers along the choicest path through the fair, stopping at the various attractions to play carnival games, eat fanciful foods, and ride the many magical rides. Attractions alongside this path will flourish, while those that receive no foot traffic will need to close.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Only those sights that remain open at the end of the fair will score points, and only by scoring high will the fairies even consider hiring you for the job again next year.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Released in the September 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
