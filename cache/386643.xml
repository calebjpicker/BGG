						               													<description>The Trio Play Tarot deck is actually three decks in one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First and foremost the Trio Play Deck is a (78 card) tarot deck with a design that highlights the ruling elements of each suit/card within the deck.  Red is used for cards ruled by Fire (wands/clubs), Blue for Water (cups/hearts), Yellow for Air (swords/spades), and Green for Earth (pentacles/diamonds).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Trio Play Tarot Deck can also be used as a standard deck of playing cards. The Knights and the Major Arcana cards have a design that readily distinguishes them from the cards you need while playing games like Gin Rummy or Poker. These differences in the design allow them to be easily found and removed when you are ready to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thirdly, the design of the Trio Play Deck allows for it to be played as a color/number matching game similar to public domain games such as Crazy 8's created in the 1930's and Mau Mau created in the 1950's or other popular multi-color matching games like Uno created in the 1970's. The Trio Play is a shedding type card game in which the player's objective is to empty one's hand of all cards before the other players have a chance to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Trio Play deck uses action cards similar to the German game Mau Mau where you can inflict penalties on the other players forcing them to skip a turn, change/switch the order of play, or force the next player to draw two to four cards.  Wild cards have also been borrowed from traditions such as Joker's Wild or 8's being Wild in Crazy 8's, allowing you to use those cards in place of any color/number card you might need to continue your hand without adding more cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules for the Trio Play deck are not in the card deck box, but available online.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The designer, Matt Green, is a graphic designer who also did the graphical design of the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
