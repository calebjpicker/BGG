						               													<description>As I looked at this board, I couldn't help but think of how difficult it would be to run in circles along the tops of the stones, constantly headed inward towards the middle. Besides making you dizzy, you would have to deal with wind, rain, and perhaps huge monolithic rocks magicly moved in your way by powerful wizards. The Olympic Games of ancient Greece came to mind. Granted we still have Olympic Games, but they are much tamer than the win or die type games of the original Olympics. What if the Celts also had a version of these games. Stonehenge would make a perfect field for such a competition. Start by running along the tops of the outer ring while trying to keep your balance, especially in strong winds. Just looking at it I couldn't help but think of it as one big obstacle course that has been waiting for thousands of years to be used again. This game is the safer version of that idea.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Number of players: 3&amp;ndash;5&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object of the game: You are a druid competing in the games. You will have to balance yourself on the outer ring, race between the two rings, hurdle the inner ring, and then push yourself to the breaking point in an attempt to be the first one to the alter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment: Druid Olympics uses the board, the deck, one figure for each player, one disk and one bar for each player, the trilithons, and one disk of each color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending the Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player reaches the alter stone. This player is the Grand Champion and is celebrated as a hero. The rest are sacrificed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
