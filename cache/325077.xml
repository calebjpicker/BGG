						               													<description>Oddia is a contraction for &amp;quot;Odd and Diagonal.&amp;quot;  It means that when a player gets an odd number, they should move their token diagonally (except when the token in in a corner square.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of Oddia is to gain the highest points by moving the tokens to reach the Target.  Each token reaching the target will get one point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Setup&amp;#10;The game board consists of 36 squares along the sides of the board making up the game zone.  The middle part of the board with diagonal lines (squares) only function as a passage and tokens cannot stop on it.  Start is on one corner and 19 which is the Target is on the opposite corner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take multiple sets of 10 tokens in their color depending on how many players are playing (2 players = 6 sets, 3 players = 4 sets, 4 players 3 sets.)  The tokens are numbered 1-10 in each set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts with setting up the board for the first 12 turns.  Players take turns putting their &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; tokens on start, rolling one die (for the 1st 6 turns, 2 dice after that) and moving forward.  Play moves counter-clockwise around the board.  When moving diagonal, play moves clockwise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If they land on another player the player sitting on that square is bumped diagonally across the board. If a player lands on a player in corner square, the player sitting in that corner square is bumped on backward.  As more tokens are placed on the board multiple chain-reactions can take place, bumping multiple players to new spaces.  After 12 &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; tokens have been played on the board the game is ready to start.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play&amp;#10;During game play only 12 tokens are allowed on the board.  Tokens can be replaced with higher numbered tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During game play you choose which one token you wish to move.  Once a token reaches the Target (19 space) they replace their token with the next higher number token which gets placed on start and if the dice number is higher than the number needed to reach the Target then the upgraded token moves the additional spaces from the Start space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues until on person reaches the target with their number 10 token.  Their points for that token will be 11.  All players then count the number of all their tokens on the board and the player with the highest point total wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
