						               													<description>Uncle Howard has left us for good. An inveterate beatnik, he lived life to the fullest. Throughout his life, he visited many countries around the world and always brought back incredible memories and stories of his adventures. In his will, Uncle Howard was amused to propose that his heir nephews and nieces divide his estate between them through a game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In This Is Mine! each player represents one of Uncle Howard's heirs, who receives parts of the inheritance to be divided among all. As the uncle lived with great artists, many of these objects belonged to famous musicians, poets and writers of his time, all very precious!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each round, the starting player divides the revealed cards from the deck into lots. Each lot must contain at least one card, but the player can split it however they see fit. Then the starting player chooses one of the lots, placing his marker on it: &amp;quot;This is Mine!&amp;quot;. Each of the other players must either agree or disagree. To disagree, a player must exchange the marker on the lot for his own and value one of the other available lots, adding money to it. When everyone accepts that the lot belongs to one of the players, a new round of claims begins, with one of the remaining players choosing one of the remaining lots.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inheritance Cards bring different types of items, and each type of item has a set-collection scoring. At the end of the game, the player with the most valuable inheritance wins. So, players must pay attention when dividing and try to gather the best collection of items.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
