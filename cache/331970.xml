						               													<description>Troy is an easy to learn and quick to set up 1 or 2 player game of strategy, with the aim of the game being to break through the opposition&amp;rsquo;s defence and destroy their defences.  Suitable for ages 9+.  As with the famous Trojan war told through Homer&amp;rsquo;s Iliad, the game pits the Trojan army against the Achaean army that has traveled far and wide to reclaim their pride after Helen was taken from them.  The game includes a large number of the armies that are written about in the war and also many of the heroes and leaders in the battle such as Hector, Achilles, Agamemnon and Odysseus.  There is also the addition of the Greek gods that play their part.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play:  You take charge of either the Trojan or Achaean armies.  Defences are set up (both sides have four) and you make the decisions of which armies to defend the wall/stockade.  Then you have the option to level your armies up to make them stronger, choose a leader to improve their abilities or attack the opposing armies.  Attacking is done through dice rolling strategy as armies have improved abilities when fighting specific enemies.  All armies have the ability to defend each attack and this is done through dice rolling.  The leader's capabilities can be even better if they are linked to their respective armies. There are also divinity cards which can be played at any time.  These can help to improve the strength of an attack of assist with defence rolls depending on their capability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of the game is to defeat the enemy army in front of their defences and destroy their wall.  The first side to destroy all four levels of the defence of their opposition is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The solo version of the game follows a set of rules for your opposition to follow, using a simple numbered system.  Be prepared to not always win tough!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
