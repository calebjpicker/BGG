						               													<description>W&amp;oacute;dz plemienia (&amp;quot;The Tribe Chief&amp;quot;) is a very interesting adventure game that will attract everyone. You have to prove that you are the best candidate for Chief of the Tribe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A true leader must be resourceful, well-planned, charismatic, and committed to trading. Candidates take a test to select who best meets the above criteria. In addition to entrepreneurship and strategic skills, the character and talents assigned to your character are also important. In addition, your village is struggling with the adversities of nature, and fate brings surprises and opportunities that are worth taking advantage of.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE COURSE OF THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place over the course of the year, and the passage of time is the movement of the pawn along the path of time. During each month, all players go through 4 Phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PHASE I - GROWTH&amp;#10;In this phase, all players successively: multiply their inventory, take 1 inhabitant, and take the crop from their crops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PHASE II - TRADE&amp;#10;During this phase, all players buy or sell their 4 inventory tokens. Additionally, whoever has a purchase can go to it and sell tokens there, regardless of the general trade.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PHASE III - CONSTRUCTION&amp;#10;In this phase, players can perform one of the three actions: set up a crop, build a store, or train a buying staff.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PHASE IV - FATE&amp;#10;In this phase, the players roll the dice. Whoever gets an odd number of spots skips fate. Whoever has an even number of spots - he draws the &amp;quot;Fate&amp;quot; card for himself and is used to write it. If having a specific character trait gives you extra prots, it is written on the card and then we follow this notation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The description of the actions in each phase is additionally written on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the end of the 4 Phases, we move the time pawn to the next month and start the queue again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MAGICAL NIGHT&amp;#10;When the movement pawn reaches the MAGIC NIGHT space, we read aloud what happens to the entire village. The record on the card applies to all players. If the holder of a character trait is treated specially, it is recorded on the card.&amp;#10;After following the instructions on the Magic Night card, move the pawn to the next month.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;EXCHANGE&amp;#10;If, as a result of writing on the card, one player has to pay something to the other, but he does not have the appropriate amount, he returns the inventory tokens to the bank, exchanges them for $ and pays the opponent. If one player has to give the other an inventory token, but he doesn't have one, he pays the equivalent of $ ($ 1 for 1 inventory). If, as a result of writing on the card, one player has to give the other a citizen token, but he does not have one, then he pays the equivalent of $ ($ 1 per 1 inhabitant).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CORONATION&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the time pawn reaches this space, the points are scored&amp;#10;individual players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
