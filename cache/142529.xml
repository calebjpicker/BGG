						               													<description>The third volume in the HorizonWars Trilogy, following MechaWar and AirFrame, BattleGroup introduces the rest of the combined arms force to the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BattleGroup is a hard science fiction battle game for actions from platoon to battalion level that captures the tactical dynamic of the all-arms force.  Tanks, artillery and infantry must fight as a cohesive whole under the command of a single headquarters, but every army has its own style and emphasis - how will you lead?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players assemble their forces from a menu of options based on their choice of Command Headquarters.  Battles are scenario-based in which each player must fight for competing priorities, with each taking their turn to activate a single element - but your opponent's forces can react to the actions of your own.  As elements take damage, their ability to fight on is gradually eroded or, if they suffer a critical hit, they may be destroyed entirely!  Should you put your injured soldiers into cover where they can patch up their injured and call up reinforcements?  Or should you press on for a vital objective?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is compatible with the other two volumes of HorizonWars, so you can add mighty mech battlesuits to your forces for additional punch and real sci-fi flavour, and dispatch squadrons of aircraft to lay down close support alongside your advancing troops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The design draws deeply upon the experiences of the author, a former officer in the British Army, to deliver a high-quality tactical experience with a powerfully realistic feel, whilst still giving a play experience that can be completed in under an hour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Key features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Miniatures wargame of modern/science fiction combat&amp;#10;    Integrated turn sequence&amp;#10;    Action-based turns&amp;#10;    d12-based dice pool for &amp;quot;one roll&amp;quot; shooting actions&amp;#10;    Customizable statlines&amp;#10;    Compatible with MechaWar and AirFrame from One Pound Wargames&amp;#10;    Designed for use with any range of modern or science fiction miniatures in scales from 1/805 (2mm) to 1/161 (10mm)&amp;#10;    Includes advanced rules and three starting scenarios&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
