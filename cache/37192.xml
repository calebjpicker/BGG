						               													<description>In Par Out Golf, two armchair golfers from Chico decided to swap traditional golf clubs and balls for wet-erase markers, ink, and a richly illustrated and laminated 18-hole championship game board course. By doing so they made golf portable (think family vacations, road trips and even around the office), accessible and incredibly easy to learn, even for someone who has never stepped foot on a real fairway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Par Out Golf is challenging, exciting and incredibly unique, playing as inconsistently as the real sport thanks to a twist you'll never &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; coming! It puts you and your family in the middle of the action, competing in stroke play, match play, or one of the many variations that will continue to challenge and entertain round after round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Best for ages 5 and up and from 1 to 4 players, Par Out Golf is filled with lighthearted competition as players shoot for the lowest score through the 18 stunningly illustrated holes on the course. Game play is easy to learn for the amateur or junior golfer, and still challenging for the pro requiring a strikingly similar level of skill and focus on every shot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Best of all, this course can be played again and again! A simple wipe with a damp cloth is all it takes to get the greens and fairways ready for another round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Par Out Golf is played on a set of spiral bound, laminated pages. Special &amp;quot;wet-erase&amp;quot; markers are used so the line is easy to draw, won't smudge, and very easy to erase. The rules are very, very close to the game of golf, complete with sand and water traps, obstacles and slopes. So close is it to &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; golf, you can play each of five classic variations of golf: stroke play, match play, tombstone play, and pro play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of the several skills you practice while playing Par Out Golf, a fascinating, and, to any golf player, significant challenge is learning how to visualize your shot. The more observant you are, the more capable you are at remembering the lay of the land, the more effectively you can imagine the exact amount of drive to put on the ball, the better you'll do. This, of course, is the essence of Par Out Golf. Like &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; golf, Par Out Golf challenges both mind and body. If you want to know more about the physical and cognitive aspects of the game, take a look at the thoughtfully written essay: Par Out Science 101 at www.paroutgolf.com.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you want, you can practice on the Driving Range (on another page) or use the 19th hole (on yet another page) to design your own. You can add your own obstacles, changing the difficulty of each hole, essentially making the game something you can play for-just-about-ever.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Par Out Golf is recommended for 1 to 4 players (it comes with four different wet-erase markers). If you must try before you buy, you can download the first three holes online.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
