						               													<description>Zero Gravity is a capture-the-flag game for 2-4 players, featuring an innovative 3D MAGNETIC ARENA, 80+ MAGNETIC MINIATURES and a fresh and unique game play!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overview:&amp;#10;Each player controls a team of 14 miniatures. The goal is to score the target amount of Cheers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setting:&amp;#10;In the year 2130 humankind was saved by the most disruptive technology of the third millennium: the hyper-local gravity engines, capable of bending the universal law of gravity at the will of its creator - the Newton Corporation. The new technology quickly became an essential part of everyday life, tackling overpopulation by exponentially increasing living space and solving famine with vertical cultivations: in a matter of years, Newton Corporation became the most powerful and notorious company in the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Despite all the good done by Newton Corporation, there were protests, strikes and even revolts of thousands of people who believed that these technological advancements were dangerous for the human species. The strong reputation of Newton Corporation convinced the world leaders to denounce such acts of violence and defend the many research facilities by the military forces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many years passed and with them the protests faded. However, a group of fanatics kept on nourishing their anger and plotted an assault on the headquarters leading to the murder of the Newton Corporation founder and CEO. The military arrested the culprits who were immediately sentenced to a public execution, to be aired across the planet as a warning against rebellion towards such a global benefactor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The execution was followed live by 99% of the world population. This exorbitant share is what pushed Newton Corporation to sponsor a spectacular and bloody event every year. Their goal was twofold: commemorating the punishment inflicted to the rebels and provide a single outlet for violence, so as to experience peace for the future year.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With the blessing of all world leaders and population, Newton Corporation developed new technologies capable of cloning the executed rebels, enhancing their abilities and peculiar traits. Four teams were created and sentenced to battle against each other for eternity, in the name of peace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the ashes of those rebels new Champions were created: the Zero Gravity Tournament was born.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
