						               													<description>We were working on a Stonehenge game of our own when we came across the anthology box. Not surprisingly, the board and pieces were very similar to those that we had developed, so it was fairly simple to transfer most of our ideas to match those provided. Our game links Stonehenge to the magical powers of the Earth and other elements and is basically a battle for magical supremacy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Number of players: 3&amp;ndash;5&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object of the game: The object of the game is to use your magical powers (represented by the cards) to convince the local clans (represented by disks on the bluestones) and spirits (represented by bars on the outer ring) that you are the druid most able to carry out the solstice rituals. Building trilithons and preparing the altar stone may assist along the way and it is vital that you keep up with the necessary preparations to avoid offending the spirits.&amp;#10;Getting Started&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment: First Druid uses all of the pieces provided in the basic game box. Each player uses the pieces of one colour (along with the trilithon card of his or her colour), so if there are less than five players some colours will not be used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout these rules, the plastic figures are referred to as 'druids'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending the Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the first player has moved his druid all the way around the ring, the game is at an end. Merely streaking ahead is not enough to secure victory, however; it is the support and alleigances secured along the way that decide which druid is the First Druid!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has as many points as the number his druid piece is on at the end, plus additional points for allied tribes and spirits. Tribes and Spirits count 1 point for the first in a run, 2 for the second, 3 for the third etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So, the game is a complex balance of using your magical powers to race ahead and gaining allies. In addition, trilothon stones enhance your supply of magic, and dressing the alter stone may move you ahead or even move your rivals backwards!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
