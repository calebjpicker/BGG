						               													<description>The goal of the game is to fill up the Walk of Fame section of the game board that is facing the player with the appropriate colored tokens. Once the player has all of their tokens they can proceed to the Award Circle. The first person to reach the Award Circle and answer that question correctly wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.  Each player select one colored playing piece and places it in the Award Circle of the game board. On the first turn, each player role the die, with the highest role being the first to play. If there is a tie, those players role again. The play then goes around the board in a clockwise direction.&amp;#10;   2. The player rolls the die and moves in any direction the same number of spaces as is shown on the die. (Player can move in any direction around the board or up and down the spokes, but must move in the same direction on the same move.)&amp;#10;   3. Once the active player lands in the colored space, the player to the left will draw a card from the same colored deck and asks the active player the question.&amp;#10;   4. If the active player answers the question correctly, that player receives that colored token and places it on the Walk of Fame section of the board that is in front of them. The active player then gets another turn.&amp;#10;   5. If the active player answers the question incorrectly, the player with that colored playing piece is given the chance to answer the question correctly and receive the token. (If there is no player with that playing piece or if the player with that piece answers correctly play resumes to the next player to the left).&amp;#10;   6. If a player lands in the same space as another player's piece and answers the question correctly, they get that token plus they can take a token of their choice that belongs to the other player.&amp;#10;   7. If a player lands in the Double Feature space and answers the question correctly they receive two tokens of that color.&amp;#10;   8. If a player has all the tokens of that colored space they do not receive another token of that color, but must answer the question correctly if they wish to continue their move.&amp;#10;   9. If a player lands in the Awards Circle, they must answer the question on the card that is of the person to their left's choice.&amp;#10;  10. Once the player has received all twelve of their tokens (3 red, 3 blue, 3 green and 3 yellow) they then roll the die and try to land in the Award Circle. They must have the exact number on the die to land in the Award Circle. Once in the Award Circle, to win they must correctly answer a question drawn from the card of the player to their left's choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
