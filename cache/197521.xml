						               													<description>In the beginnings of times was Keberadaan, and he decided to release the energy whose expansion created all the known planes. The tenth plane is the one of Kallat. A summoner society that uses the energy form Keberadaan to bring life to incredible creatures and fulfill the missions that are imposed.&amp;#10;Now you can be a Summoner from the Kallat&amp;rsquo;s universe, start your training and fight against others who are trying to enter in this world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;'Kallat' is a strategy game in which you are a Summoner that materializes different creatures to fight against a rival or between teams. You have the possibility to choose your own Summon&amp;rsquo;s grimoire that will contribute Life and Existence Points to your Pyre. These points are the ones you need to take care if you do not want to lose your battle.&amp;#10;At first, you will take 6 Tactic/ Strategy Cards and place your Monolith in the board. Now is the moment when you can start summoning the creatures that will represent you in the battle field. In the second turn, your Summons will be able to move around the board as well as they can attack using their weapons, skills, spells, etc. in the quest to reduce the Life of the opposite party and wind the encounter. There are certain attacks with altered states that produce extra damage and there are others in which magic is involved; therefore, they not only consume your Action Points but also your Existence Points. So be careful when you use them! Even though they are very powerful, excessive use of them can put your creature in a high risk since loosing all your Existence Points will make you loose the battle.&amp;#10;Tactics and Strategy Cards are not only to summon a creature since they can also bring you extra help that, if you use wisely, can turn around the outcome of the game.&amp;#10;Another way of winning the game is with special attacks meant to destroy all the enemy creatures by removing their Projection Points. Each eliminated Summon gives you one Victory Point. At the beginning of the training, the party can decide the maximum number of Victory Points needed to win the game (usually 3 to 5 points).&amp;#10;Furthermore, you have different boards to create sceneries in the shape you want. Also, you can determine the weather and lightning of each territory. Notice that each feature comes with its own consequences.&amp;#10;Kallat is thought for you, as Summoner, to feel part of a world full of energy and action in which your battle expertise and the knowledge of the creatures you choose from your Grimoire can make you the best Summoner of all times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
