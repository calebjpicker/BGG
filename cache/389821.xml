						               													<description>Towards Guy Alley Card Game is a trick-taking game where players will play some of their cards twice. Specifically, the winner of each trick will take their own card as points, but the losers will place their cards face down in a special stack.  Once a player is out of cards, they pick up the cards they lost with, turn them over to a different rank range, and continue playing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the round, players bid for how many points (not tricks) they will take. These bids must be formed by the sum of two cards, numbered 0 to 7.  A player also has the opportunity to play one of these two bid cards to a trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players earn points for hitting their bid exactly and will otherwise lose points. The person with the most points after a number of rounds wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
