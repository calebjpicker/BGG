						               													<description>We wanted to come up with a game where conversations are the main focus. Because we think that young people learn best from each other. With those thoughts we created WOGO.&amp;#10;WOGO is a conversation game where you win by coming up with the best/funniest/most different... answer to one of the questions about the 17 SDG&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;#10;The questions are about sustainability and the 17 world goals. We came up with the title of the game by merging the two words &amp;ldquo;WORLD&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GOALS&amp;rdquo; - which is exactly what the game is about.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
