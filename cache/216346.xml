						               													<description>It began long, long ago (last year), when Sour John moved into our quiet town of Little Worth.  At first all of us were excited, because a silly string store was opening in town, and Sour John&amp;rsquo;s dad was handing out free samples to all the kids in the mall.  We had a blast!  But the spoiled brat &amp;ldquo;Sour John&amp;rdquo;, as we would later come to call him, wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied.  He wanted to rule the entire mall, and eventually all of Little Worth.  Sour John was a child genius, and he soon opened his own weapon store, &amp;ldquo;More Gore!&amp;rdquo;, in the mall.  This is where he conducted his late night experiments to perfect a can of silly string that would be unbreakable, unending, AND impossible to resist.  One night he went to the fountain in the greenery section of the mall, &amp;ldquo;Fount Bloom&amp;rdquo;, and discovered that Fount Bloom&amp;rsquo;s special mixture was exactly what was needed to craft his most diabolical creation &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;ONE STRING TO RULE THE MALL!&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fortunately for us all, he misplaced The One String before he was able to wield it.  It was found by a good kid, nick-named &amp;ldquo;Seagull&amp;rdquo;, but it quickly corrupted him.  He started using The One String as deodorant and calling it &amp;ldquo;my freshness&amp;rdquo;.  (Yeah, it was weird.)  Seagull took up with the wrong kids, the &amp;ldquo;Redheads&amp;rdquo;, and later changed his name to &amp;ldquo;Gold Thumb&amp;rdquo; (based on his newfound obsession with the James Bond movie &amp;ldquo;Goldfinger&amp;rdquo;).  But again, as fate would have it, &amp;ldquo;Billy Bob&amp;rdquo; Braggin found The One String in Gold Thumb&amp;rsquo;s discarded lunchbox, and he kept it safe for a while.  Most recently he just gifted it to his younger cousin, &amp;ldquo;Fro-Gro&amp;rdquo; Braggin.  But Sour John has just discovered that the Braggin family is in possession of The One String. He has dispatched his scariest goons, the &amp;ldquo;Nostrils&amp;rdquo;, with robes and skateboards of black, to retrieve The One String and bring it back to &amp;ldquo;More Gore!&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The two groups of good kids in Little Worth Mall, &amp;ldquo;Yellow Ship&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Lean &amp;amp; Green&amp;rdquo;, have just held a secret meeting at &amp;ldquo;Livin&amp;rsquo; Well&amp;rdquo;, a natural supplement store owned by &amp;ldquo;Spell Wand&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; parents.  They have decided that Yellow Ship will undertake the dangerous task of taking The One String all the way (downstairs) to Fount Bloom, the only place where it can be dissolved forever.  Meanwhile, Lean &amp;amp; Green will serve as a distraction to keep the Redheads and the Nostrils away from The One String.  Secrecy is of the utmost importance.  Each of them grabs their can of silly string and prepares for battle.&amp;#10;The &amp;ldquo;horde of the strings&amp;rdquo; has been set loose in Little Worth Mall!  Who will deploy their forces the most efficiently, and what will become of The One String?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Horde of the Strings&amp;quot; is a simple game with 42 unique cards representing the characters in the story, 1 map, and 1 rulebook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME:  To draft and then play your cards effectively so that you have as FEW points as possible at the end of the round.  (Normally the lowest score possible would be 0.)  Also, be aware that at the end of the round if one player has BOTH the &amp;ldquo;Sour John&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The One String&amp;rdquo; cards in their hand, they get to SUBTRACT 50 points!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
