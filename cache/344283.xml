						               													<description>These rules have been developed for people who have no previous experience in wargaming, yet like to play games. &amp;#10;A ruleset of eleven pages, no more than the game of RISK. From page thirteen on, we included some extra rules. You will not be needing them at first, but we can imagine that you would like some variations as your experience grows. Start with that page when you have some battles under your belt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players or even solo. The army structure that is presented in this writing, can be easily adapted to the number of miniatures that you have available. Albeit that a large army look suitably impressive. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This ruleset simulates battles in the period of 1861 to 1865, the American Civil War. Units were drawn up in line in order to maximise the effect of their weaponry. The musket, the type of gun that the troops were supplied with, was only accurate on short distances. During a volley all muskets were fired simultaneously at the same target. Off course, this required iron discipline of the men. Soldiers of that age were drilled to fight formed up into line formation and to march in columns. During the game, your troops will do likewise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In an ideal scenario the enemy was pinned in place by fire of artillery, the threat of cavalry or the fire of infantry. Once the enemy was pinned, other units could deliver the coup de gr&amp;acirc;ce. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades, or even armies. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim is not to annihilate the enemy unit to the last man, but to inflict so much damage, indicated by chits, that morale is brought down and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and removed from the table top. By a clever combination of movement and shooting, dashing cavalry manoeuvres and carefully positioned artillery pieces, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades and as such, the whole army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your role will be that of a brigadier in the Confederate or Union armies, commanding a brigade of troops. Should more players be available, one of you will play the part of Commander-in-Chief or general. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So onwards, to glory! And, off course: have fun!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This product contains one rulebook and two commander dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ndash;Description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
