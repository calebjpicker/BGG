						               													<description>In 4 Pints, you will visit a typical English pub for a nice pint of beer. Each turn, one of you will go to the bar, where four pints await you. &amp;#10;To buy them, you must first scratch your pockets looking for a few pounds but you must be careful to control your drunkenness level and avoid elbowing and slipping. The walk to the bar can be quite an adventure!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game lasts as many rounds as the number of players. Starting with the first player, each round, players play consecutive turns until the deck of Beer cards is exhausted and all players have played the same number of turns. Your turn has 2 steps:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Reveal Purchase cards: you must reveal Purchase cards one by one from the deck and place them at the center of the table. You must draw at least 1 card and you can draw as many as you want until you collect enough money to buy a pint you like from the bar, or until you decide to pass. Each time you draw a card, add its value to your total if it is a Money card, and apply its effect if it is an Event card.&amp;#10;     Buy 1 pint or pass: you can only buy 1 Beer per turn and you must pay its full price with the Money cards accumulated during your turn at the center of the table and/or your game area. When you buy a pint, place the card upright (unspilled) in your game area, in full view of the other players. If you don't want to buy anything or don't want to risk it with the Purchase cards, you may pass and end your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
