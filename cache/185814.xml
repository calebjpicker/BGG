						               													<description>City of Ideologies is a strategic board game in a futuristic setting for two up to four players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Humanity had to leave Earth centuries ago and travels in search of a new home in a huge city by the vastness of space. Players assume the role of leaders who are trying to reshape the city after their vision in an erupting revolution against the old system. For this they must legislate, kindle demonstration, gain influence over the districts of the city and always keep an eye on the mood of the people and the changing game board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both the game board, as well as the laws are constantly changing, it is important to keep a cool head, gain advantage through agreements with other players or through own concepts or intrigue to weaken the position of the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;City of Ideologies combines different game mechanics: You move protesters across the board, which turns around three times each round, role dice and push your luck, gain influence in districts, use different cards to perform unique actions and at the end of each round, one person is chosen by election of all players who is allowed to change a paragraph / rule mechanism.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each action may be carried out in various ways. In most cases, they are paid with influence points, which vary from faction to faction depending on their main focus. If a player can not muster enough points for an action, then he can trade with his fellow players. Or he activates a district, which lets him perform the action or pulls a card that allows him to perform the action or uses a person of his faction. Or he changes a paragraph, so that the action costs less points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who collects the most victory-points will win the game after five rounds. The way you collect victory points depends on the one hand on your ideology, which you choose at the beginning of the game. So every player gains victory points in different ways. For example, one player gets a victory point every time he prevents other players actions. Another player collects victory points if the other players give him voluntarily cards or influence points. On the other hand players can gain victory points on certain districts, by cards and paragraphs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end the player will be victorious, who is both the most accurate follower of his ideology, as has also been successful in competitive areas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
