						               													<description>Woodlings is a cultish, animal-infested game of murder, bluffing and elder-beings in the classic &amp;ldquo;Mafia&amp;rdquo; format.&amp;#10;Each player controls two Woodlings, little forest creatures each with their own abilities and attributes that they can use to their advantage.&amp;#10;The game revolves around Ancients, powerful, age-old woodland spirits that require specific sacrifices from their followers in order to stay sated.&amp;#10;At the start of the game, one Woodling will be anonymously designated the Killer, whose goal is to sacrifice two other Woodlings to an Ancient (of their choosing) without being caught.&amp;#10;Every other Innocent Woodling must in turn use their own abilities and deduction skills to collectively pinpoint the Killer before they accomplish their goal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes play over three stages&amp;#10;The Night stage&amp;#10;The Discussion stage&amp;#10;And the Voting stage&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Night stage, every player but one closes their eyes&amp;#10;Then in a clockwise direction, every player may use the action printed on one of their Woodling cards before tapping the shoulder of the player next to them to indicate that it is their turn&amp;#10;When the player who went first is tapped, they say out loud (eyes still shut) that it is the killers turn&amp;#10;The Killer then has 20 seconds to sacrifice another Woodling by placing their character sheet above the three Ancient cards in play&amp;#10;Then everyone opens their eyes and moves on to the Discussion stage&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Discussion stage players can talk freely amongst themselves in order to try and figure out who the killer is&amp;#10;The killer cannot use their nightly ability or indeed sacrifice themselves, so nightly occurrences and Ancient requirements play a big role in deducing which Ancient is in play and, by extension, which Woodling the killer may be.&amp;#10;However, the Killer can also work this to their advantage, whether by choosing a sacrifice that meets multiple Ancient requirements or by deliberately not sacrificing another Woodling that is under suspicion.&amp;#10;Also, yes if you are the Killer you can sacrifice your own teammate to draw suspicion away from you&amp;#10;You monster&amp;#10;Players are by no means are required to tell the truth either. Bluffing, false accusations and entrapment are all very much encouraged. It&amp;rsquo;s more fun that way.&amp;#10;When players decide they are ready to vote on who the killer is, the game moves on to the Voting stage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Voting stage, each player has one vote, regardless of how many Woodlings they have left.&amp;#10;Players collectively vote on which Woodling is the killer out of the remaining character sheets in play&amp;#10;Majority rules and players can also vote to abstain. Any tiebreakers will result in an automatic vote to abstain unless a player changes their vote&amp;#10;The Woodling with the most votes is then accused. If the killer is accused they reveal themselves and the Innocents win, otherwise the game continues to the next Night stage&amp;#10;However, if the killer has sacrificed two Woodlings and has not been accused at this stage, the Killer wins&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In summary the game ends if&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Killer is accused (Innocent victory)&amp;#10;The Killer for whatever reason cannot carry out their sacrifices (Innocent victory)&amp;#10;The Killer sacrifices two appropriate Woodlings and is not accused the next day (Killer victory)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
