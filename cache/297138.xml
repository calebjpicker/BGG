						               													<description>On an uncharted island somewhere on Pacific Ocean you came across something that no one expected... Dinosaurs! But you fear nobody is going to believe you. That's why you need to take photos of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Explore the island, take many photos but beware, dinosaurs are not used to visitors. Some will flee but other may find you tasty! You will not be able to show your photos when you're eaten. Also remember that it's not the quantity of photos that count but quality. Big and dangerous dinosaurs are worth more points than small, easier to find ones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Let the Dino Safari begin!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During setup players are required to create the &amp;quot;island&amp;quot; using tiles with hexagonal spaces starting with &amp;quot;camp&amp;quot; tile. Once it's done 12 randomly chosen dinosaur tokens are randomly placed on &amp;quot;nest&amp;quot; spaces facing down. Then each player choose their character and place him/her in the camp. Players take their turns clockwise. During player's turn you have three movement points and one &amp;quot;take a picture&amp;quot; action. You can spend those in any order you want. Characters can move in any direction they want, &amp;quot;plains&amp;quot; space costs 1 movement point while &amp;quot;forest&amp;quot; space costs 2. You cannot enter &amp;quot;crags&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;lake&amp;quot; spaces. To take a photo move to a space adjacent to dinosaur token and uncover it then take the card with species you've uncovered. On each species card you can see how much points it's worth and its skills like movement points and special rules. Players can also take pictures of already uncovered dinos to get their cards but you can score only once for each species. Starting with round two after you're done with your character's actions you can move 1 uncovered dinosaur token (you must be in possession of that species card). You can use that to run away from other players, scare off another uncovered dinosaur to remove its token so nobody can take a picture of it anymore or, if it's a carnivore, attack other players. Attacked player loses one life and is forced to return to camp. If a character is attacked third time (losing last remaining life) he/she is considered &amp;quot;eaten&amp;quot; and eliminated from game (his/her score is 0 no matter how many cards were in his/her possession). From now on during eliminated player's turn he/she can only move dinosaurs. Game ends when all 12 tokens are uncovered. The sum of points on cards in your possession is your score. Highest score wins. There is also a chance that all players are eaten. In that rare case game ends and nobody wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
