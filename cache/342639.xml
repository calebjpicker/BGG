						               													<description>FormulaGP is a racing game for 1-6 players in the pinnacle of motorsport world. Like in the real racing there are typical motor sport elements like: car setup, tyre type selection, tyre degradation, pit stops, changeable weather conditions, Energy Recovery System (ERS) to manage, DRS zones, slipstream, there are also random incidents like e.g. safety cars, yellow flags, damages, penalties and of course what racing is about  wheel-to-wheel action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Player will become a formula driver of one of the six most successful currently existing teams and will race on any racetrack in the world with two to six players or in solo mode by controlling &amp;lsquo;bots&amp;rsquo;. FormulaGP offers modular racetracks built from special kind of a puzzle tiles which are stable and easy to configure which allows to build any racetrack in the world. It Can be a slow track with tight corners difficult in overtaking or fast with long straights or similar to any real one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay is based on the action cards which represents the speed  and movement types. Players will collect the cards and plays accordingly with an option to build a kind of a combos making the cards more powerful for attack, defense or movement. However, combining these cards will increase the risk level which may end up with some incidents or additional tyre degradation or even a car spin, but with a bit of luck nothing will happen. Dice plays a marginal role in the game and are partially used in quick qualifying session, also to measure Pit Stops, rate the risk consequences and evaluate some incidents. &amp;#10;Like in modern formula cars players have to manage energy recovery system by collecting energy. It&amp;rsquo;s up to players how to use up stored energy as it can be used as additional buffer to keep action cards or to use so-called &amp;lsquo;overtake button' to increase the chances of successful attack/defensive maneuver or just to extend car movement. Each team has different ERS/OT combinations, gear ratios and special team ability simulating different car characteristics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Basically players needs to play the action cards in a way to keep the balance between the speed, tyre wear and risk level to move the car on the board and stop at the fastest places on the track keeping up the momentum. That sounds simple but taking into account tyre degradation, tyre compound differences, ERS management, different car characteristics, battling opponents for position and random racing incidents it gives a real challenge to keep the pace and win the race &amp;hellip; but if you will take right decisions, you will race smart with a bit of a luck you will become a FormulaGP world champion!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
