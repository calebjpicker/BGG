						               													<description>Dark Rituals: Night Terrors is a mini-expansion that contains everything you need to add a new Witch and her Minions to all your games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;middot; 7 highly detailed plastic miniatures&amp;#10;o 1 Mara&amp;#10;o 6 Twisted&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;middot; Large Mara ID Sheet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;middot; Twisted ID Card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;middot; Grimoire&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;middot; 5 Witchcraft Cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mara was alert and excited. Night was falling and it was time to feed. She lay back in her bed, closed her eyes, and slipped into a deep trance-like state that was as close as she got to sleeping.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Her mind drifted across the dreamscape, looking for a psyche to invade. Her mind probed minions, taunting a Condemned with thoughts of freedom, a Ravenous with visions of a barren land with no food and a Twisted with a hale and beautiful body. But there was no sport and little sustenance in such weak beings. She needed something with more power to drain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Suddenly, the Astral Plane warped and reformed around her, as another entity left the waking world and began to exert its own will on the malleable landscape. It could only be another Witch, certainly a meal worth taking. Mara watched carefully as the being revealed its likes and fears in its growing manifestation. No, this was not a Witch, it was a Demon. Still, perhaps the risk was worth taking. If Mara could drain a small fraction of its essence while it was distracted by her visions, her power would grow immeasurably.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As she conjured images of weakness in the Demon&amp;rsquo;s slumber, she realized she had overstepped: she was losing control of the dream! Was the Demon simply waking? Or was it taking control? She had moments to decide if she should flee or gamble all for her prize. Then the truth became clear. She was waking! This was her esoteric domain. Never before had she been dragged from it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;She tensed for an attack as she struggled to focus on the physical world. But all she could see were swirling mists as she was drawn into the Conjunction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
