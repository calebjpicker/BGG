						               													<description>(Not to be confused with the UK game show just simply called Blankety Blank even though the two formats are quite identical to one another.) is based on the formerly popular Network 10 hit game show, hosted by the late Graham Kennedy from 1977-1979 followed by Daryl Somers from 1985-1986 and Shane Bourne from 1996-1997 later on Nine Network. (for which in turn was adapted from the hit US Game Show 'Match Game').&amp;#10;&amp;#10;to set-up&amp;#10;1. elect a compere (for best results, pick a witty friend)&amp;#10;2. Place panel wallet so that the opening is at the top.&amp;#10;3. Put stiffener board. Place Key Cards in front of the game cards, place one on each side in such a way that no word can be seen in the windows under the panelists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Order of play&amp;#10;1.Compere selects 2 contestants - A or B.&amp;#10;2.Compere asks contestant A the question which appears on the 'Contestant A' side at the top of the panel wallet.&amp;#10;For Example: in game 1 (Tom Thumb lost his &amp;quot;BLANK&amp;quot; while riding on a yo-yo).&amp;#10;3. Contestant A substitutes a word for 'BLANK' in doing so, Contestant A tries to guess the answers given by the panel.&amp;#10;4.Having announced his/her guess the compere slowly (revealing only one answer at a time) removes the key card.&amp;#10;Contestant A now knows how many of the panel agrees with his choice and scores that number accordingly.&amp;#10;5. The procedure is repeated for Contestant B.&amp;#10;6. Should a tied score result - the following game is then played.&amp;#10;7. The winner is entitled to play Super Match.&amp;#10;8.Compere picks up Super Match card and asks the contestant to respond a word (e.g. for Game 1 use the word 'FACE'. For Game 2 use 'BABY' etc.)&amp;#10;9.Contestant may ask all others at the table for help. Prize money is paid dependent upon which response the contestant selects corresponding to the three previous selected answers, (e.g. Word 1 'FACE', If Contestant says 'FACE MASK' he/she wins $50.&amp;#10;10.If the contestant gives one of the three answers (i.e. Pack. Mask or Life, he/she is entitled to play for the Jackpot Match.&amp;#10;11.If none of the three words is selected, the game finishes and another contestant is selected to play against the winner.&amp;#10;(NOTE: The two number '9's' are actually listed on the instruction card.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jackpot Match&amp;#10;1.Compere gives both the contestants and himself a pad and pencil.&amp;#10;2.Compere reads out the word (e.g. Game 1 - he reads Comic).&amp;#10;3.Compere and contestant each secretly respond on paper (e.g. Comic Book or Comic Strip). If the answers are identical, the contestant wins 10x his/her winnings from the immediate preceding Super Match round.&amp;#10;4.The game is thus completed and a new contestant is selected to compete against the current champion.&amp;#10;(NOTE: After completing Game 1, remove question card from wallet and lay face up on the table - then place Game 2 when completed on top, and so on. When the wallet is empty, turn the whole set of questions upside down and place them all back in the wallet - Remember to replace the Key Cards.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
