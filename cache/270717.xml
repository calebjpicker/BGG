						               													<description>Kingsfall is a true 4X campaign style board game with a heavy focus on expansion, resource management, and strategic gameplay. The game was designed for players of all skill and play types as it aims to be streamlined and straight forward. There are no excess mechanics and rules that other 4X style games seem to have, and this allows players to focus on having fun rather than reading rulebooks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players each take control of a Guild, and must make their Guild the dominant Guild in the region by whichever means the player chooses. Each Guild has minor perks that may aid a specific play style, but all of the Guilds are on a level playing field. No one Guild is stronger than any others, so choosing your Guild can be a simple as picking your favorite color or name.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns each moving their pieces around the board, building structures and collecting resources along the way. Heavily dependant on resource management, resources can be used to build more structures and units to increase a player's presence on the map and expand their borders even further. Players must be sure not to grow too quickly however, as in traditional 4X style, everything must be  taken care of. People must be fed and paid, and cities must be maintained. Grow too quickly and you won't be able to sustain your empire, grow too slowly and other players will surely beat you to the finish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With no guidelines restricting player interaction, each of the players is highly encouraged to interact with one another through diplomatic talks. Alliances, war, declaration of friendships, trade, treaties, shunning, the list goes on. Players must bear in mind however the repercussions of their choices and how they may affect other players. With multiple paths to victory, Kingsfall caters to many different play styles. It is entirely possible to win without ever going to war, and it is also possible to win by only going to war. Ultimately the path to victory is up to the player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Read the back story here&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
