						               													<description>The 21st Century's Explosive New Card Game! Move over Poker, there's a new card game in town! The2101Game! It's an exciting new card game that combines skill and luck with a unique twist to provide the ultimate card gaming experience. The2101Game is a very easy game to learn, and it can be played with as many as 11 players. The pot grows with rapid speed, giving every player an opportunity to win BIG! So if you're feeling lucky get your family, friends, and fellow gamers together and start playing The2101Game. The2101Game caters to people of all different gaming backgrounds. From the avid gamers to non-gamers alike, they all agree that The2101Game is one of the simplest yet most complex games that they have ever played. People who are typically and instantly drawn to this game are people who play poker, spades, rummy, Phase 10, and Uno although just having a general knowledge of cards is all you need to play The2101Game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The2101Game is played with two decks of cards minus a 2 of diamonds, a 10 of clubs, and an Ace of spades.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start play everyone is dealt 3 sets of cards which are 3 pocket cards (these cards go in your hand and are for your eyes only!), 3 face up cards, and 3 face down cards (which go over above the face up cards). The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all 9 of your cards by first playing all of your pocket cards, then all of your face up cards, then finally all of your face down cards. All you have to do is match or beat the card on the pile and if you can't, you pick up the entire pile and must play them all before you play any new cards unless you have  &amp;quot;2101 cards&amp;quot;, also referred to as wild cards. There are 3 &amp;quot;2101 cards&amp;quot; which are the 2, 10, and Ace. The 10 is the highest of the 3 cards. When played, the 10 clears the pile and also gives the player another turn. The Ace is the second highest &amp;quot;2101 card&amp;quot;. It has no special powers but is just considered high. The lowest &amp;quot;2101 card&amp;quot; is the 2. When played the 2, also referred to as the &amp;quot;any card&amp;quot;, starts the pile back low. It can be played on any card and any card can be played on top of it. You can only play your face up cards once you have no pocket cards left and you can only play your face down cards when you have no face up or pocket cards. Pocket cards must be played one at a time unless you have multiples. Multiple cards of the same value can be played together but is not mandatory and suits do not matter. Face Up cards must be played the same way but if you can not beat the card on the pile with one of your face up cards you must pocket that card that you were unable to play along with the entire pile. Face down cards are also played one at a time but once you touch a face down card that is the card you must use. If you can not beat the card on the pile with the chosen face down card you must pocket that card along with the entire pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The betting element is what makes the game more interesting. There are 4 betting stages. First the table bet (this is a predetermined amount to get cards (similar to an ante). Second bet is the pocket bet. This bet is made after the cards are dealt but before any cards are played and is initiated by the person with the highest set of face up cards. The &amp;quot;2101 cards&amp;quot; are what is typically looked for when determining who has the highest set of face up cards.  The third bet is the face up bet. The face up bet is initiated by the first player to get to their face up cards without having any pocket cards. The fourth bet is the face down bet. The face down bet is initiated by the first person to get to their face down cards without having any face up or pocket cards. When a bet is initiated, starting to the left of the initiator, players must match the bet to continue in the round. Players also have the option to raise when their turn comes around. If a player does not want to make the bet they must fold their hand and forfeit any already wagered chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Note - once a player puts their bet on the table it can no longer be removed even if the player changes their mind and decides to fold. Betting in turn can significantly reduce the chances of this happening.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Note - When 4 cards of the same value are played on to the pile it constitutes a clear as a 10 would and also gives the player who played the fourth consecutive card another turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
