						               													<description>This game have been created by two people who have time to waste on school day. A game which just needs : A pencil, a piece of sheet grid, a Friend and your Brains. Cause it's a strategic game, where you need to fight and conquer territory, by strangle your enemy in a prison of holes. Ok. Now here is the rule.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As told above, the only things you need, is Pencil and Sheet grid, That's right, no eraser just that. Its a game which is simple to do, to play, and to explain. Just few rules to understand and you can play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What about the story ? Imagine that you are in a limited zone, with a chosen draw as player. You move and shoot each turn. When you move, you blacken your old player and place a new one at movement range. When you shoot, you blacken the place you shot from which is in Attack Range. A place which is Blackened cannot be passed through and is considered as an empty box. When the players ( all players ) aren't connected ( divided by empty boxes. ) The game ends, and the winner is the player with the most space. This game maybe looks  boring but it isn't!  Try it, its cost you nothing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A lot of variants can be made, from the mines to Multiplication Artifact and Invisible Shield. Same for the Mod, Capture Flag, Zombie mod, Team, Werewolf. Infinite possibilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
