						               													<description>Micro Miners: A micro deck builder takes a full size deck building experience and compacts it down to the size of about a standard deck of cards. The game shifts the focus from collecting many cards to collecting the right cards at the right time for deck optimization.  Every time you shuffle your deck you will bring your deck size down to the your current limit keep your deck dedicated to the actions you care about. Players need to choose the cards they take from the Tunnel carefully if they want to load the final gem into a cart and score a point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Micro Miners is played like many deck builders and can be played  by taking turns gaining cards and using them to score points.  However in Micro Miners each player starts their turn with 3 Effort which allows them to take actions.  They can spend a number of effort indicated to acquire an available card from the tunnel or use it to play a Cart in front of them.  It can also be used to load gems into any suitable cart in play controlled by any player, but any player can block the gem from being loaded if they have a gem that matches the targeted cart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have a hand limit size of just 2 cards and will draw a new hand at the the end of each turn.  If they ever need to draw cards but their draw pile does not have enough they will shuffle their discard pile to form a new draw deck.  Each time they do this they will count the number of cards in their deck, not including any carts in play or gems loaded into them, and will choose which cards to discard down to their deck limit.  All discarded cards will be Tossed face down into the Shaft.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to score 3 points will win this micro deckbuilder.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Plays in 20-30 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
