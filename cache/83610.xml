						               													<description>1861 - First Manassas (American Civil War in 3D)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first battle in our series of the American Civil War games in 3D sees the Union army under General McDowell meet the combined armies of the Confederation under General Beauregard and General Johnston.  The battle is fought just north of Manassas Junction across the stream called the Bull Run.  The Union hope for a swift victory to end the war, but a delayed attack by the Union has allowed the Confederates to combine its two armies.  The Union still outnumber the Confederates, but only just, so let the drums roll and the flags fly, it&amp;rsquo;s time for brother to meet brother.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be easily played over 2-3 hours and there is a 16 bound time limit on it.  Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game that gives a flavour of the American Civil War period.  A simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?&amp;#10;Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit.  You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&amp;rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion.  The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in four quadrants, the First Manassas six page Battle Report, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice.  The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you start this great series of battles with a victory?  Play North or South in this the first of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;gt;Source: wargamesdownload.com&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
