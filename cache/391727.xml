						               													<description>Journey was originally designed to be included in an issue of Dragon magazine, but was rejected. Tom Wham revised it to be published as a giveaway for GaryCon XII.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game up to four explorers travel through a hollow Earth in search of treasures. Movement is from one &amp;quot;decision point&amp;quot; to the next; on a turn a player assigns dice sides to the arrows leaving their current point as they wish, then roll a die which determines which one is used. If a hazard/reward area is entered  the player rolls on a table to determine what they gain or lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players cannot exist on the same space and so bump each other, but the player being bumped decides where they move to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are each given two random special abilities at the start of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when all players have exited the map or when the treasure deck runs out; at that time the player with the greatest total value of treasure wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
