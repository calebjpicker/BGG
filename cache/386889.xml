						               													<description>Marvel United is all about teamwork, and Heroes are known for forming specialized teams from time to time. Avengers, X-Men, Defenders, Guardians of the Galaxy, to name but a few. Each of these teams develops its own characteristics and strategies, though being part of a structured team also comes with limitations and drawbacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Avengers&amp;#10;     New Avengers&amp;#10;     X-Men&amp;#10;     Uncanny X-Force&amp;#10;     Defenders&amp;#10;     A-Force&amp;#10;     Guardians of the Galaxy&amp;#10;     Deadpool Team-Up&amp;#10;     Asgardians &amp;amp; Allies&amp;#10;     Spider-Army&amp;#10;     Champions&amp;#10;     Wakandans&amp;#10;     United Heroes&amp;#10;     Team Iron Man: Pro Registration&amp;#10;     Team Captain America: Secret Avengers&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When adding a Team Deck to your game, all Heroes being used must be part of the same Team, and the Hard Challenge difficulty level should be used. That Team deck is shuffled and placed facedown within view of all players, with 2 cards revealed to form the Team Display. These are essentially Hero cards, with Action symbols at the bottom and a Special Effect. On their turn, a Hero can choose to either play a regular turn or they can choose to play a Team turn. In that case they don&amp;rsquo;t touch their Hero cards (neither drawing nor playing) but choose instead one of the Team cards in the Display and play that card in the Storyline, as if it were their own card. Immediately a new card is drawn from the deck to fill the Team Display (until the deck runs out). This not only brings a different flavor to the match, but also gives Heroes more options of what to do on their turn. However, there is a downside to playing as a Team. Most Team decks have at least one card with a mandatory negative effect. This is in effect as long as that card is faceup on the Team Display. In order to shut it down, a Hero must take one for the team by taking a Team turn, choosing the negative card, and playing it facedown in the Storyline.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All Teams in this set can be played using solely Heroes which are part of boxes that are (or will be) available on retail. Although, of course, most of these Teams also have additional members who are part of exclusive expansions or Stretch Goals from this or previous campaigns. In the lists below, these latter characters are shown in italics. Also note that many of these Teams might still be bolstered by Heroes revealed over the course of the Multiverse campaign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from Kickstarter campaign&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
