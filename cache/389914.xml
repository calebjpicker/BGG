						               													<description>&amp;quot;Your swords, please. We don't want to make a mess of things in front the Chancellor.&amp;quot; -Count Dooku&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A sinister Sith Lord stalks the galaxy! Once a respected Jedi Knight and the padawan of Grand Master Yoda himself, Count Dooku has chosen the dark side. He now serves as the apprentice to Darth Sidious, carrying out his master's will in dark schemes from Geonosis to Coruscant and beyond using powerful pawns, such as the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Although he is often protected by IG-100 MagnaGuards, Dooku has unparalleled skill with a lightsaber and is more than a match for multiple Jedi.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With his knowledge of the dark side and the weight of the Separatist Army at this back, he has all the tools he needs to secretly orchestrate a galactic civil war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
