						               													<description>A 2&amp;ndash;4 player strategy game where players, as cultists, must construct a garden in which shrines worthy of dragon worship are to be built.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The dragons however, are very picky about how the garden is constructed, and each only favours a single colour of decoration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must perform 2&amp;ndash;3 rituals at these dragon shrines in and around the garden. The first player to reach this number wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, players play cards to either move their cultists or decorate the garden.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rituals have overlapping requirements however, so more often than not, the players will have to fight over the shrines they wish to access.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Make use of powerful warp spells to traverse the garden quicker, or build them into the garden for a permanent boost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;May the best cultists win the dragons' favours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
