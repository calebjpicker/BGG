						               													<description>The success of the Oppai Go tournament has even reached the realm of Tengu, animal gods that have been watching over Japan for centuries. Four animal-featured girls have decided to walk the Earth and compete in the funniest strip challenge in human history. Make your purr&amp;hellip; uhm, better!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:&amp;#10;1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side&amp;#10;2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)&amp;#10;3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)&amp;#10;4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)&amp;#10;5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a new version of Oppai Go that is stand alone but can be combined with the previous game to extend games up to 5-6 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
