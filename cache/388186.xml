						               													<description>Pond Poker is a fast paced card game for 2-8 players, ages 8 and up. It is easy to learn and quick to play. Game play is about 30 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here's how it works: deal 5 pond cards to each player face down, then lay 6 more face up in the center of the table to form the pond. Each round, a player draws an action card and reads it out loud, setting off a frenzy of activity as players rush to complete the action within the nail-biting 10-second time limit. Beware, though - if you can't complete the action in time, you'll have to draw a penalty card!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the rounds progress, the game only gets more intense with unexpected actions that can turn the game on its head at any moment.  At the end of 10 Action Rounds, all players score their remaining hand with the Score Sheet. Player with the most points wins! With 10 exciting action rounds, Pond Poker is the perfect game to add some chaotic fun back to your game night.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
