						               													<description>On To Vienna! &amp;ndash; simulating the Austro-Prussian War (1866) &amp;ndash; is a sequel to On To Paris! using a wargame system adapted from Victory Games&amp;rsquo; The Civil War. Players familiar with On To Paris! will be immediately familiar with the scale, system, rules and game play of On To Vienna!, taking the action to central Europe and Italy in 1866.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The systems challenge players to control the leadership, organization and military operations of Armies and Corps during the later 19th century, this time between Prussia and its ally Italy against Austria and the independent Federal German States, including Bavaria, Saxony and Hanover, with the exciting possibility of French Intervention.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed for two players, On To Vienna! is also suitable for solitaire play. Eleven scenarios include various &amp;lsquo;early start&amp;rsquo; situations and the historical start of the war as well as a number of key points with the conflict already underway that can continue past the historical end of the conflict. An introductory &amp;ldquo;learning&amp;rdquo; scenario introduces players to the system and several scenarios look at exciting variations such as Austria being able to focus and bring more effort against either Prussia or Italy. Players can also pick any scenario as a starting point and determine their own period of the conflict to simulate. Most scenarios can be played on sections of the maps for smaller, shorter and faster games and as before with On to Paris! many optional rules explore interesting historical options for both sides.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On To Vienna! is a fast moving competitive game where players do their best to control their forces and where every decision creates excitement and tension. The game system features interactive game play with flexible initiative and variable turn length as well as extensive defensive player reaction ability. The game puts players in charge of all the famous Corps and Army leaders of the Austro-Prussian War which are all rated for their individual leadership qualities and occasional unique characteristics like resistance to following orders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
