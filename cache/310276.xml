						               													<description>Take the role of a Dungeon Hunter with unique stats and abilities. Battle Towers of increasingly difficult monsters. Work your way up to the Tower Boss and claim the Legendary Items to help you defeat all 7 Towers to gain ultimate victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Use your selected Dungeon Hunter and Battle the Tower of your choosing with the Battle Deck. The battle deck consists of Attack Cards and Defense cards. These cards are added to your Dungeon Hunters Corresponding Base Stats. After drawing 5 battle cards the battle begins. Select one of the 7 Towers to Battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play the battle card of your choice down within the energy requirements. A card can only be played if you have the energy equal to the card value. Energy is spent when you play an Attack card. Energy can be gained by playing defense card. If you receive damage when playing a defense card that damage is also dealt to your energy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your overall attack towards the monster is your base attack stat plus the attack card you have played. Same for your defense, it is the defense card and your Base Defense stat added together. If your overall attack is higher than the monsters overall attack damage is dealt to the monster. But if the monster has a higher attacking card the damage is dealt to your Dungeon Hunters Health Points. Once the monster's health is brought down to 0 the tower shifts down and you battle the next monster.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every two monsters beaten the Tower rewards you with a random item that can help you defeat the Tower easier. But while the Tower can help you every 5 turns the Tower throws an Event at you. Events can be good helping you gain health, items or even boost your stats. But just as good as they can be they can also be bad. Removing items, losing health, or even doubling the Monsters stats.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Only after defeating all the monsters and the Tower Boss can you gain a Legendary item to help you Battle other towers. Defeating all 7 Tower will grant you victory!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
