						               													<description>Mind Game is a 2 player bluffing game from Japan. Players have a simple set of cards and betting chips, and try to bluff each other to win chips by having the highest card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has a set of cards numbered 1 to 5 and a Trick Star card (effectively a zero that beats the 5). They also have a card marked Big, and one marked Small, and a set of plastic chips for betting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players place their Big and Small cards in front of themselves and then place a number card against each face-down. If the chosen cards are 1 to 5, the higher number goes against the Big, the lower against the Small. If the Trick Star card is chosen, it goes against the Big card if the other card is the 5, otherwise it goes against the Small.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The start player then chooses one of their face-down cards and puts it forward, with some chips bet on it. Their opponent must now advance their matching Big/Small card and match the bet in chips. The two cards are revealed and the highest wins, the player taking all the chips. The revealed cards are set aside and players can check them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the card values match, they are set aside and the betting chips are also set aside.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then the players replenish their face-down cards, and move the cards to the appropriate Big/Small side. This might indicate that the previously Small card is now Big, and therefore what the values of the two cards might be.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues with the Start marker alternating. The game ends when the hands are exhausted or when a player has run out of chips. the player with the most chips is the winner.&amp;#10;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
