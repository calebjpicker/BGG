						               													<description>Protect your farm from all kinds of harm! You&amp;rsquo;ve decided to add fences to your large farm. Anything to keep the nosy neighbours away, right? But shhh, you have to build them secretly! Whoever guesses the fences made by the other farmer, wins. Think smart, guess patiently and fence away!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Guess the Fence, you must protect your farm from all kinds of harm. The goal is to guess all the fences made by your opponent. Each player starts with: a farm board, an erasable marking sheet, 3 long fences, 3 diagonal fences and 8 small fences, one red and green marker. The partition board is placed between the players. Each farm board has a grid of 25 numbers.On their board, each player makes 4 shapes using their fences - a square, a rectangle, a big triangle and a small triangle. The fences are placed along the dotted lines only. The circle of the fence is the vertex of the shape and must be placed on a number. The end of a fence must meet another vertex. The shapes must not have shared vertices or sides. Once both players have made their fences, the game begins.On your turn, you can either guess a vertex or guess a shape. When you guess a vertex-&amp;#10;Look at your marking sheet and call out a number where you think your opponent may have a vertex&amp;#10;Your opponent looks at their farm board and tells you if it is right or wrong. &amp;#10;If correct, they say &amp;lsquo;hit&amp;rsquo; and you shade that vertex number in green. &amp;#10;if wrong, they say &amp;lsquo;miss&amp;rsquo; and you shade that vertex number in red.&amp;#10;When you guess a shape (calling out the vertex of that shape)-&amp;#10;Look at your marking sheet and call out a shape where you think your opponent has made one&amp;#10;You must say the name of the shape and all its vertices. for e.g. &amp;ldquo;do you have a triangle at 3,4 and 9?&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;Your opponent, then, looks at their farm board and tells you if it is right or wrong. &amp;#10;If correct, they say &amp;lsquo;hit&amp;rsquo; and you get 3 points, and shade the shape! &amp;#10;If wrong, they say &amp;lsquo;miss&amp;rsquo; and you lose 1 point!&amp;#10;When a player guesses all the shapes of the other, the game ends. The person with the highest points, wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Guess The Fence is a guess-and-write game that will help burgeon your visual reasoning and creativity. It&amp;rsquo;s perfect for families to have a great time but also introduce kids to an innovative learning experience. Enjoy with them as they apply their knowledge of geometry to make shapes with fences and develop essential skills that go beyond academics. See their creativity and imagination soar right before your eyes! This is a simple but highly addictive educational game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
