						               													<description>&amp;quot;We have been the first victims; be careful, we will not be the last&amp;quot;&amp;#10;(President Negr&amp;iacute;n)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Service of the Republic: The game of diplomats, propagandists and spies (1936-1939) is a diplomacy, propaganda, and espionage game set in the troubled 1930s. It is semi-cooperative in nature and combines exploration journeys, resource management, hidden roles, political intrigue, and abstracted war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In it, each player represents a diplomat (sometimes also a propagandist and spy) serving the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War. Throughout 3 game turns (which simulate the 3 years between September 1936 and September 1939), your objective will be to travel throughout the map (Europe and North America) in search of military, humanitarian and energy supplies, and once obtained, ship them to loyal Spain, so that the beleaguered Republic has some chance of survival. In the final part of the turn, the military rebels (supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy) will launch several offensives and gradually conquer the cities that are still in the hands of the Republic. At the end of turn 3, World War II will break out (which will mean the salvation of the republican regime, as Spain is framed on the side of the allies against the Axis).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
