						               													<description>SanremoN is a collectible card game. The deck consists of 40 downloadable cards. It celebrates 67 years of events and characters of Sanremo's Festival, setting them in a fantasy universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(The Sanremo Music Festival, or &amp;quot;Festival della canzone italiana di Sanremo&amp;quot;, is a popular Italian song contest and awards ceremony. It is held annually in the city of Sanremo, Liguria, Italy.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PURPOSE OF THE GAME: Being able to bring your opponent's life points to 0&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is played exclusively in two (1 Vs 1) and with a single deck of cards. The two players (Challenger A and Challenger B), after having shuffled the deck, draw 5 cards each.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The remaining cards remain available to Challengers who at the end of each round of play will draw one or more cards, depending on how many will they play, so you always have 5 cards. Each Challenger has 5000 Life Points to start.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the first round, the Challenger A plays his first card, chosen among the 5 in their possession. The Challenger A is in the process attack, then the ATK (Attack) points of the card played will be those to be taken into account. The Opponent B, vice versa, is located in defense phase, and then play one of 5 cards in his hands, considering the DEF (Defense) points associated with it. If the ATK points of the opponent A will exceed DEF points of the opponent B, the Challenger to win the turn and the difference between ATK of A and B will be the DEF points to be subtracted to the Opponent's Life Points B. If the ATK points are equal to or lower than DEF points opponent, no Life Point will be subtracted from the Challenger B.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the round, played cards are collected in a new deck (the discard pile), and the two Challengers will fish from the draw pile as many cards as they were played before moving in round next. He will fish for the first Challenger will play in the Attack phase (in our case, it is for the Challenger B).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This continues round after round, until the the deck runs out. Then all the cards collected in the discard pile will be reshuffled and put back into play. Repeat for 5 times at most.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner will be the one who will manage to bring the Life Points of the opponent to 0, or the one who at the end of the 5th phase of the game has higher Life Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
