						               													<description>Once again, the mining dwarves went in search of adventure and, while exploring a set of rocks at the foot of a mountain, they found a mysterious cave with a bright light coming from within. As they approached, the dwarves were impressed with the variety of crystals there. So it was decided: whoever gathered the most valuable collection of crystals by sunset would own the newly discovered mine. Everyone immediately went to work, eager to secure victory at the end of the day. Even if, for that, a small sabotage in the work of the other competitors was necessary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Quartz: The Card Game, on your turn you have to decide if you explore the mine or if you protect the crystals you already found.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If decide to explore the mine, you must reveal cards from the Mine Deck until you decide to stop or if an accident happens. If you decide to stop, collect all the crystals you found. If an accident happens, you lose them all! Some crystals may be discarded to hire Assistants that can either help you or mess other players' turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you decide to protect the crystals you found, all the crystals of the same kind may be stored in your chest, so your opponents may not take them away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game players get points for the sets of crystals you found. Whoever get more points is the Mine owner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
