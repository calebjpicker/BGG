						               													<description>A strategy game for 2 players, 10 years old and more&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By properly placing your pawns,&amp;#10;You will generate chain reactions&amp;#10;That will destroy all your opponent's pawns!&amp;#10;Except if the opposite happens...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal of the game&amp;#10;Remove all of your opponent's pawns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game components&amp;#10;A 19-hexagons boardgame&amp;#10;35 pawns, one side white, the other side black.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game mechanism&amp;#10;The player who starts the game is randomly determined.&amp;#10;The first player places one pawn of his color on an hexagon he chooses on the first circle (the circle of 6 hexagons around the central hexagon).&amp;#10;The opponent places a pawn of his color on another hexagon of the first circle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From now on, each player will place a pawn of his color on his game turn by applying the following rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     a player cannot place a pawn on the central hexagon,&amp;#10;     a player cannot place a pawn on a hexagon on which there are already 1 or 2 opponent's pawns,&amp;#10;     a player can place a pawn on an empty hexagon if it touches a hexagon on which he already has 1 or 2 pawns,&amp;#10;     a player can place a pawn on a hexagon on which he already has 1 or 2 pawns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Explosion&amp;#10;If, at the end of his turn, a player has 3 pawns on the same hexagon, an explosion happens: the 3 pawns are distributed in a Y shape on contiguous hexagons, and pawns that may have been on covered hexagons before the explosion now belong to the player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Chain reaction: successive explosions&amp;#10;It is possible (and it is even the good way to win!) that, after this first explosion, other hexagons have 3 pawns or more of the player's color. The player must proceed with the explosions until there is no more hexagon with 3 pawns or more, or until there are no more pawns from the opponent (he has won in this case!).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The player must start with one of the hexagons having the most pawns on it (it is possible that there are 4 pawns on the same hexagon).&amp;#10;     After each explosion, if there are still possible explosions and pawns from the opponent, go back to step 1!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of the game&amp;#10;The game ends when a player has no pawns left on the board. His opponent is the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
