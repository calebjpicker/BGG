						               													<description>A card game / parlor entertainment based on the concept we know today as Mad Libs. One player, designated the &amp;quot;reader,&amp;quot; reads the provided comical story with several missing phrases. The other players, among whom small cards with non-sequitur phrases have been distributed, are called upon to fill in the blanks with the phrases in their hand: &amp;quot;a salt mackerel,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;a box of gum drops,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;a long-eared donkey,&amp;quot; etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game directions do not state how the winner is determined. However, in other very similar Parker games of this kind (i.e. &amp;quot;How Silas Popped the Question&amp;quot;), the winner is the player who laughs the loudest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game debuted in the 1929 Parker Games catalog and seems to have been discontinued by the next edition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
