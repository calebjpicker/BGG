The time has come to prove your worth. Are you willing to show us your prowess with the blade, your stealth and cunning or your mastery of the magic arts? Whatever path you choose, adventure awaits.&amp;#10; Dungeon Crawl&amp;trade; is primarily designed as a single player game set in a dungeon environment within a generic fantasy setting. The player chooses a character class to play (thief, fighter or sorcerer), rolls up the character&amp;rsquo;s attributes and places its starting equipment on the adventure sheet. The player then moves the character through the dungeon overcoming monsters, obstacles and traps in an attempt to find the dungeon&amp;rsquo;s random finale card and win the game. This game uses the game system that we created for the EA game books. Each game should take 20 &amp;ndash; 30 minutes to play and because of the random manor of the game, each game should be very different to the previous one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Variations&amp;#10;Several card variations, each with their own unique set of monsters, traps and treasure cards will be available for download soon.
