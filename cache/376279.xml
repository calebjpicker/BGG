						               													<description>Hupszi is a cute fluffy creature. You are on your way to the school with your best friend when you discover Hupszi in the bushes. After you give them your lunch and pet them you decide to take them to the school with you. But it turns out it was not the best idea because Hupszi is not very good at obeying rules and also it is strictly forbidden to bring pets to the school. You face a feally difficult challenge to keep Hupszi hidden from the teachers. Can you work together in perfect harmony to deal with the mischieves of Hupszi and save yourselves from going to the head teachers office?&amp;#10;This is a cooperative two player game. You each start with all your cards in your hands. There are two main type of cards:  on watch, and snooze. You place the 3 teacher cards in the middle of the table. At the beginning of each round you flip the top Hupszi card and see what he is up to and where. Each teacher has their own territory, you see the symbols in the corner of the cards. The same symbols appear on the Hupszi cards so you see which teacher will be angry if Hupszi gets discovered. After you flipped the Hupszi card you each choose a card from your hand secretly then reveal it at the same time. If at least one of you played an on watch card you can put back the Hupszi card at the bottom of the deck. Buti f both of you were snoozing then Hupszi gets discovered and you place it by the teacher whose territory he was making a mess at. If a teacher catches you the 5th time you loose the game. If you manage to play all your cards twice in 2 rounds without being sent to the head teacher you are truly best friends whose minds are set on the same wavelenght.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
