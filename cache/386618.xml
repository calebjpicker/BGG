						               													<description>A collection of 3 word games to encourage fun an creativity in spelling. Working with guidelines for Key Stage 1 &amp;amp; 2 these games will help children develop spelling and word building skills, whilst maintaining the enjoyment of a card game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;100 letter cards&amp;#10;1 Spinner&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards have a letter on one side and 1/8 or a picture of the BFG (big friendly giant) on the other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The games are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Build a BFG: Each player has a 5 card hand face up on the table, and there is a 3x3 grid of cards in the center. On their turn, a player either spells a word from their hand with up to 1 card from the grid, or discards 3 cards; all cards use are replaced from the discard pile. The cards of the word are flipped, and the player keeps all parts of the BFG picture they lack.  The first to finish their picture wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BFG Crossword: On their turn a player plays cards from their hand to a growing crossword on the table. They get 1 point per letter in the word they make; the first to 20 points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BFG Grab the Word: All 100 cards are placed letter-side down / BFG picture part side up. On their turn a player spins the spinner and flips over a card with the picture part selected. When anyone sees a word they can spell from the revealed letters, they shout the word and collect the cards. After all cards have been revealed, the one with the most cards wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
