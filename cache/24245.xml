						               													<description>Laser Battle includes a modular hi-precision plastic board which allows for a variety of game-start layouts as well as unlimited expansion using additional play-set boards.&amp;#10;Use the real laser module and hi-precision mirrors to attack your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Tower and &amp;ldquo;blow it up&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Similar to Deflexion/Khet, players are attempting to set up a series of mirrors to bounce a laser into the opponent's tower.  Here are the differences from Khet:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     In Khet, the laser is always moving orthogonally.  In Laser Battle, the laser must be bounced at the proper angle off pieces which can be rotated to 16 different angles (22&amp;frac12;&amp;deg; increments: 0&amp;deg;, 22&amp;frac12;&amp;deg;, 45&amp;deg;, and so forth), which reflects the laser orthogonally and/or diagonally, at the players' discretion (or error!).&amp;#10;     In Khet, the laser is fired from the walls of the game board.  In Laser Battle, the laser is being fired by a unit, which you may rotate for very surprising victory.&amp;#10;     In Khet, each player must fire the laser after her move.  In Laser Battle, firing the laser is optional, allowing both sloppier play and stealthier play.&amp;#10;     Khet has a fixed game board (and a moveable / roteable mirrored second-floor with the Khet 3D: Tower of Kadesh expansion).  The board in Laser Battle is modular (single-floor), allowing for numerous configurations.&amp;#10;     A Laser Battle set comes with extra headdresses for the pieces so you can buy a second identical set, and play with up to four players.  Also, it is available in two color schemes, which could allow for an eight-player laser frenzy!&amp;#10;     There are only three types of pieces in Laser Battle.  Khet has four types in the basic game, and a fifth (Khet: Eye of Horus Beam Splitter) in an expansion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Tower has 6 light sensors &amp;ndash; and when hit by the laser it flashes red lights and makes an explosion sound, which signals the end of a game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game was the subject of a lawsuit in which the designer of Khet: The Laser Game brought suit against MGA Entertainment and the court found Laser Battle as infringing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
