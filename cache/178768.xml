						               													<description>&amp;quot;World of Mythology&amp;quot; is an unpredictable card game in which you play for the gods from ancient mythologies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is no odd stuff in the game - playing decks and special cards only!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 5 mythologies in the World of Mythology game: Greek, Egyptian, Hindu, Norse, and Slavic.&amp;#10;There are 60 playing cards with gods, 19 special cards, and 5 player cards with gods' powers in WOM CLASSIC.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One game round for 4 players lasts about 15 minutes! That's why WOM is a very comfortable way to have an interactive break wherever you are!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every mythology is presented by 12 gods and goddesses&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Greek gods: Zeus (12), Poseidon (11), Hera (10), Hades (9), Ares (8), Athena (7), Hermes (6), Hephaestus (5), Artemis (4), Dionysus (3), Apollo (2), Aphrodite (1).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Egyptian gods: Ra (12), Geb (11), Tefnut (10), Osiris (9), Horus (8), Nephtys (7), Set (6), Anubis (5), Isis (4), Toth (3), Ptah (2), Hathor (1).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hindu gods: Shiva (12), Vishnu (11), Parvati (10), Ganesha (9), Skanda (8), Kali (7), Indra (6), Surya (5), Lakshmi (4), Varuna (3), Vayu (2), Kama (1).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Norse gods: Odin (12), Thor (11), Frigg (10), Loki (9), Tyr (8), Hel (7), Heimdall (6), Njord (5), Skadi (4), Forseti (3), Bragi (2), Freyja (1).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Slavic gods: Perun (12), Dazhbog (11), Dodola (10), Veles (9), Triglav (8), Morana (7), Stribog (6), Svarog (5), Vesna (4), Hors (3), Jarilo (2), Lada (1).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The playing cards are simple and graphic; all detailed information can be referenced on the big player cards. After a few plays of the game, players will begin to easily recognize all the powers of gods and icons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So let's start the game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Every player gets a random player card with a mythology (a trump for that game round) and gods' powers description.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. All players receive a hand of 4 random cards from the shared deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Dealer shows a random card from the shared deck to assign a player for the first move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. WOM is a circle card game, so every player has to play 1 card per game circle: by beating the previous card or dropping his card to the opponent's stake.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5. You can beat an opponent's card with a senior card from the same mythology (Zeus with his 12 points beats any Greek card) or with a god from your mythology (your trump) if his armor is strong enough (trump Hera with her 10 points beats gods from other mythologies with their 1 to 12 points).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6. When you play a card from your mythology (your trump), you use its special power automatically. You should read aloud the power description from your player card to all the opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7. The winner of the hand takes all 4 cards to his stake (his earned points deck). But sometimes the winner can lose some cards from his stake due to gods' special powers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;8. All players take 1 card from the shared deck. The new hand begins with the previous circle winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;9. The game round ends when the shared deck and playing cards end. It's time to count points from the stake. The winner of the game round becomes a dealer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;10. You can play either by rounds (counting just victories) or by reaching the exact point level (victory by reaching 500 points, for example).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every character has a special power and an armor. Powers are based on ancient myths (Zeus beats opponents with lightning and Thor can use a thunder hammer, for example).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Armor level depends on god's position in adapted mythological hierarchy. There are gods and goddesses in every mythology whose power is to summon a special card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 3 types of special cards: Wealth, Secret, and War.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wealth is a card with bonus points: +10 (6 items), +20 (3 items), +30 (1 item). Available for Apollo (arts), Ptah (arts), Isis (fertility), Bragi (poetry), and Jarilo (fertility).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Secret is a card with a secret combination bonus: &amp;quot;Get +5 points for each Greek card in your stake&amp;quot;, for example. Available for Athena (wisdom), Toth (knowledge), Frigg (wisdom), and Vesna (nature).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;War is a deck of just two cards: Death and Life. It's available for all gods of war: Ares, Horus, Skanda, Tyr, and Triglav. If you play the god of war from your mythology, your opponents have to play a risky mini-game similar to Russian Roulette.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We also plan for great future decks: Chinese gods, Japanese gods, gods of Mesoamerica, gods of Science, The Outsiders, and Good vs. Evil double deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
