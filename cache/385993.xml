						               													<description>Poison Garden is a solo experience where the player is a caretaker tending to a garden filled with deadly and poisonous plants. As the brave caretaker, you must weed and care for the Poison Garden to prepare it for visitors, but beware; the garden has an infamous reputation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Poison Garden is for one player and plays for 30 minutes or less. Players will start off with a deadly and poisonous garden represent as tiles that needs serious tending before the gates can be opened to the public. Each turn, the player will tend one plot of the garden, which triggers a chain reaction of sub-actions with adjacent plots. Some of these actions are:&amp;#10;- Weed: removes a plant from the garden for further care&amp;#10;- Transplant: moves a plant to a different area of the garden&amp;#10;- Water: immediately tend an adjacent plot&amp;#10;And more&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sometimes your hard work will become undone as the chaos of weeds comes back to your garden. Players will have to be diligent and thoughtful to execute their actions in a timely fashion so as not to fully exhaust their time tokens. If a player can tend to all the plots visible in the garden, they win. If not, then they succumb to the poison garden and the iron gates will remain locked.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are additional modules included in the game to ramp up the difficulty by introducing new poisonous plants that introduce new sub-actions and challenges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Poison Garden is a title in the new Talon Strikes small-box series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from developer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
