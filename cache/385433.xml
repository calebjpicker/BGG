						               													<description>Compete with fellow Sasquatches in this push-your-luck card game to prepare the most delicious barbecue using questionable ingredients. Foul play is never off-limits, but stay away from nosey cryptozoologists that try to disrupt your feast.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, start by going on a Hunt to gather Ingredients and Recipes by flipping cards from a central draw pile into an open draft. Push your luck by flipping more cards to have more options to choose from, but make sure you don't run into a Cryptozoologist because they will surely ruin your Hunt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After Hunting for Ingredients, head back to your BBQ Pit where you commit Ingredients to your Recipe cards in order to cook the dishes and score points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first Sasquatch to cook an Appetizer, a Main Course, and a Dessert triggers the final round. After the final round, Sasquatches tally up their points to find out who is the BBQ Pitmaster.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
