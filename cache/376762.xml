						               													<description>In this solitaire game that aims to recreate fictitious events of 18th century France you will roam around the city of Paris looking for targets, followers of the order. For this you will need to carefully navigate the streets and rooftops, avoiding guards or neutralizing them from the back. But be careful, don&amp;rsquo;t look ahead or ignore your action grid and you will find yourself cornered and you will have to flee. Your goal is to assassinate as many targets as you can before getting to the end of the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start the game you will gather the map cards into deck in front of you. All cards are face-up and oriented upright. These are the cards you will be moving through throughout the game.&amp;#10;Behind this deck of cards you will place the action tracker card, sideways and with the action grid visible..&amp;#10;These cards you will hold in the palm of your left hand. Using your left index finger to keep track of the game's rounds and your right thumb will be held onto the last used action on the action grid (this is important for later on).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The map cards:&amp;#10;The map cards are the cards your character will be traversing. Your position on the cards must be remembered when playing in-hand. Each map card has one target and many guards, all of which can be assassinated. However the target is of course... the target. And you will gain points depending on how many targets you have assassinated at the end of the game.&amp;#10;The map cards are divided into squares, and most of these squares have one of two &amp;quot;heights&amp;quot;, ground level or rooftop. Movement through connecting squares of the same height is unlimited, however to change height or do other parkour maneuvers you will have to use the action grid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action grid:&amp;#10;The action grid contains 4 possible actions, of which you may perform one each round. The catch is that you can never do the same action 2 rounds in a row, and you can only do an action that is connected via an arrow (or line without arrow) to the last used action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A summary of the actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Jumping. Take a run-up of one square to jump from one over a ground square in the same direction as the run-up.&amp;#10;     Descending. Go down a height.&amp;#10;     Climbing. Go up a level.&amp;#10;     Assassinating. Assassinate a target to claim that card as a point. Or assassinate guards to open up new paths.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These actions are explained in greater detail in the game's rulebook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game end:&amp;#10;As explained above you attempt to beat each card by assassinating the target, thus getting a point. Or getting caught by a guard and having to flee to the next card.&amp;#10;You play until you've finished the deck and then tally up your points to see how skilled an assassin you are.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to the sisterhood!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
