						               													<description>The creators of numerous successful Kickstarters, including Four Tribes and Dig Down Dwarf, bring you a new blind bidding and deck-building dungeon delving card game. Of Dungeons Deep! is a fusion of many mechanics and was inspired by such games as Smash Up!, Dungeon Raiders, Cutthroat Caverns, and Friday and is set in an amazingly illustrated world that is whimsical, with just a touch of darkness. Of Dungeons Deep! takes a brave new look at a classic theme, is easy to learn, and employs simultaneous play which equates to almost zero downtime for players!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We are proud to announce that ALL the artwork for Of Dungeons Deep! has been commissioned by the fabulous Derek Bacon. Mr. Bacon has worked on such titles as Tower, Baldrick's Tomb, and Smash Monster Rampage. His style is both playful and edgy, and we feel it is the perfect match for the game. Plus his name is BACON so.....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bluffing and Blind Bidding. Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman. All characters are very unique and play quite differently from one another. This sets the bar high for replay value!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No Down Time! Since all play is done simultaneously, no players are ever waiting on others for very long. This makes Of Dungeons Deep! one of the fastest dungeon delvers out there.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
