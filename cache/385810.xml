						               													<description>Do you love word games? Do you hate word games? Almost Words is for you. A lighthearted, witty party game in which players are given a topic and two minutes. Spelling and grammar don&amp;rsquo;t matter as players trade and arrange uniquely-designed multi-purpose letter tiles to create clever responses. Players pitch their response to the judge, who picks their favourite. Fast-paced and endlessly funny, Almost Words is enjoyed by people of all ages, gamers and non-gamers alike.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Almost Words is played over a series of rounds. Each round is played as follows:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reveal a Topic&amp;#10;The judge reveals the top card of the Almost Cards deck. This is your topic for the round.&amp;#10;Each other player takes 10 random tiles and places them face down on their presentation mat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Arrange and Exchange&amp;#10;The judge starts the 2-minute sand timer.&amp;#10;Arrange&amp;#10;Flip your tiles face-up and create a response to the topic. &amp;#10;Your response can be any number of words.&amp;#10;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to use all 10 tiles.&amp;#10;Spelling and grammar are optional.&amp;#10;Each tile can be used in multiple ways as letters, numbers, pictures or symbols.&amp;#10;Discover creative uses for your tiles. There are no limits, just what the judge likes best! &amp;#10;Exchange&amp;#10;If you don&amp;rsquo;t like your tiles, you can trade them with other players in real time.&amp;#10;The clock keeps ticking during all trades. &amp;#10;The judge announces when time is up. Then it&amp;rsquo;s time to&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pitch Your Nonsense&amp;#10;Each player takes a turn pitching and revealing their response to the table.&amp;#10;On your turn, set up your creation with a little story or sales pitch to explain how it relates to the topic.&amp;#10;Your pitch might be an elaborate tale setting the stage for the perfect punch line, or it might be short and sweet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Judge your Friends&amp;#10;The judge picks their favorite based on whatever criteria they please.&amp;#10;The chosen player is awarded with the Almost Card for that round.&amp;#10;The player on the judge&amp;rsquo;s left will judge the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
