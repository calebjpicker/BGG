						               													<description>Description from the Back of the Box;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This expansion introduces The Under God, the architect of the Everrain, to be used as an optional replacement end game boss to the Avatar of The Under God. The Under God comes with its own unique set of Elder One boards, with a host of new dark powers and abilities to combat. From unfathomable depths, the nameless one finally comes to finish its work...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the Avatar heralds its arrival, it was only a matter of time before the Old One itself arrived on the earth to claim its prize! Upon a great creature it rides, nestled in it's stone throne where it has sat for time immemorial.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Old One offers a new boss to try and beat when playing the Everrain. The Old One behaves differently than the Avatar and has its own unique objectives to defeat it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Old One token begins the game at the end of the Discovery Track, and it represents how close the Avatar is to rising from the sea and destroying the world! Ordinarily this token rarely moves, but if enemies begin to gain the advantage and are allowed to run amok, the token will begin to descend down the track. If the Enemy and Old One tokens ever meet, then the Avatar awakens and appears on the game board!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Avatar has its own board, which describes the effects that it has on the game. These are things that players must be wary of doing, because each time that the player triggers one of these effects, it brings the Avatar one step closer to arriving in the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For players to have a chance at winning, they have to trigger the endgame. This is done in one of 2 ways:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Reaching the end of the Discovery track - If players can do this, they have gathered enough knowledge to now attempt to subdue the Avatar. This is known as the Slumbering Objective&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Defeating the Avatar - If at any point the Avatar is summoned, the end game immediately is triggered and players must defeat it somehow. This is known as the Arisen Objective&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In both cases, once the endgame has been triggered the Avatar board is flipped, and the player's objective is revealed&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
