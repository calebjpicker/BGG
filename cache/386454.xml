						               													<description>It is a card game that is based on a traditional card game called &amp;quot;The Dutch.&amp;quot; The goal of the game is to be the first player to have 3 Poulpy tokens. To gain a Poulpy token, a player should be able to discard their last card. The cards contain illustrations of Poulpy, an octopus with different expressions. Players attempt to remember &amp;amp; correctly identify Poulpy's expressions in order to win tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start with 4 cards face down in front of them as their &amp;quot;line.&amp;quot; On a player's turn, they must: (1) Draw and secretly look at the top card, (2) Play the card in the discard pile face up OR add it to their line &amp;amp; discard one of the other cards face up, (3) As an option, discard one or more cards if they believe these to be identical to the last card played. If the discard was a mistake, the player/s must take back their card and add a card to their line without looking at it. There are special cards in the game such as the &amp;quot;Switch&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Peek&amp;quot; cards that players can use to exchange cards between other players and look at one of their cards respectively.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
