						               													<description>It&amp;rsquo;s the mid-1800s and railroads are beginning to transform the United States. You are the biggest of the &amp;ldquo;big shots&amp;rdquo; in this new, exciting and burgeoning industry. Visionaries like Cornelius Vanderbilt and James J. Hill are working for you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game you&amp;rsquo;ll compete for cards representing the most important components of railroad-building &amp;ndash; Capital, Land, Track, Locomotives &amp;ndash; and more. Since the railroad business is such a gamble, you&amp;rsquo;ll compete in this game by playing hands of 3-card poker (from a hand of seven cards). However, since this is more or less a friendly competition, the rounds are not winner-take-all. Instead, the player who wins a round will gain two components, while his/her opponent will gain one &amp;ndash; and it&amp;rsquo;s the winner&amp;rsquo;s decision as to who gets what. Therefore, close attention to your needs and those of your opponent is required. Your goal is, ideally, to build four or five branch lines &amp;ndash; each with a Visionary and Coal. This is easier said than done, however. Card management in the form of &amp;ldquo;what poker cards to play now and what to save for later&amp;rdquo; is an important factor in winning the game. So is when to act like a snake and play &amp;ldquo;dirty tricks&amp;rdquo; on your rival.... Let the battle begin to resolve the question: Who will win the Railroad Boss trophy!?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
