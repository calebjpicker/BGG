						               													<description>Each player is in control of four &amp;lsquo;frogs&amp;rsquo;.  Starting side by side, one for each player on the numbered spaces of 1 thru 4, players begin. They take turns spinning the spinner that is numbered one thru eight and also shows outlines of frogs on each of its numbers.  After spinning the arrow, the player can choose the number, at either end of the arrow, to move any one of his frogs on the board.  This option allows a player to use a bit of strategy.  He must choose which number and which frog is best to move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to capture all four of his opponent&amp;rsquo;s frogs.  A capture is made by leaping over a frog with a crowned frog.  An uncrowned frog cannot capture.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;antique game of leap frog to crown a frog, a player must complete an entire round on the game board with his piece.  When a player reaches the space 24 marked on the ringed board, he receives another game piece to place on top of his frog.  This frog is now considered crowned.  If at any time a crowned frog leaps over his opponent&amp;rsquo;s frog by going beyond it by just one space, the leaped frog is captured and removed from the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If two frogs of the same color occupy the same space and are leaped over, they cannot be captured.  More than two uncrowned frogs cannot be on a space.  The player who captures all four frogs of his oponent wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
