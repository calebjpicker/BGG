						               													<description>Fazes is a card game for 3 &amp;ndash; 8 players. It has rules similar to Rook, Phase 10, Hearts, and other rummy like card games. The object of the game is to get the least amount of points by the end of the game. There are 6 fazes, each with its own set of rules. The last faze called &amp;ldquo;madness&amp;rdquo; combines all of the rules from previous fazes. Fazes is a fun and challenging card game for all skill levels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting Fazes&amp;#10;Each player is dealt an equal amount of cards. The player with the green 2 begins play in each faze by leading with that card. Play continues in a clockwise direction. Players must play the color that is led. After everyone has played a card, the highest numeric card of the color played will take the hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trump&amp;#10;Players who are out of the color led will have to play a trump card if they have it.  Red cards are TRUMP in fazes 1 &amp;amp; 6 and when a red card is played it wins the trick. For example, if a player leads with a yellow card and the next player is out of yellow, they have to play a red card, if they have it, which trumps the trick. If two or more players have to trump any trick, the highest numeric red trump card wins the trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faze 1 : Red Trump&amp;#10;Each red card is worth 5 points. If a player is out of the color that is led and they have a red card, they must play it, which trumps the trick. Once all of the tricks are won, count up each red card, and write down your points. Shuffle and deal all the cards for faze 2.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faze 2: Tricks &amp;lsquo;R Pointr&amp;#10;Each trick  worth  10  points. Trump  is  not  active  in  this  faze.  The  highest  numeric  card  of  the color  led  wins  the  trick  and  10  points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faze  3: Yellow Pointers&amp;#10;Each  yellow  card  is  worth  10  points. Trump  is  not  active  in this  faze.  The  highest  numeric  card  of the color  led  wins the trick. Each yellow card in the  trick  is worth  10  points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faze  4: 13&amp;rsquo;s&amp;#10;The  #13  in  each  color  is  worth  25  points. Trump  is  not  active  in  this  faze. The  highest  numeric  card  of  the  color  led  wins  the  trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faze  5: Last Trick&amp;#10;The  person  who  wins  the  &amp;ldquo;last  trick&amp;rdquo; get&amp;rsquo;s 50 points deducted from their score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faze  6: Madness&amp;#10;Each  objective  and  rules  of  fazes  1  -&amp;shy;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#144;  5  are  in  play!    Red  cards  (5  points  each)  are  trump  and have  to  be  used  if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the card that is led.    Every  trick  is  worth  10  points  plus  the  value  of  pointer  cards  that  could  be  included  in  the  trick.  Yellow  cards  are  10  points  each.  The  13&amp;rsquo;s  are  25  points  each.    Special  note  -&amp;shy;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#144;  the  red  13  is  worth  30  points  (5  points  for  being  red,  25  points  for  being  a  13).  The  yellow  13  is  worth  35  points  (10  points  for  being  yellow,  25  points  for  being  a  13).  And  finally,  whoever  wins  the  last  trick  get&amp;rsquo;s minus  50  points  from  their  score! The  player  winning  the  last  trick  must  still  account  for  any  points  within  the  trick  itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SHOOT    THE    MOON&amp;#10;If  a  player  wins  all  of  the  points  in  any  faze  they  have &amp;ldquo;Shot  the  Moon!&amp;rdquo;  The  reward  for&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Shooting  the  Moon&amp;rdquo; is  all  other  players  receive  the  total  points  of  that  faze! For  example,  if  a  player  in  faze  4  receives  all  four  13&amp;rsquo;s,  then  all  other  players  have  100  pts added  to  their  score!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of all 6 Fazes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
