						               													<description>Radio was released as one of six in Milton Bradley's &amp;quot;Radio Series&amp;quot; of inexpensive race games costing 15 cents each. It debuted in the Bradley Games catalog of 1927 and was sold through 1933. A slightly larger but cheaper edition, at 10 cents, appeared in the 1943 catalog.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is NOT the same game as the slightly more complex/expensive &amp;quot;Radio Game&amp;quot; published by Milton Bradley in 1925.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a simple spin and move game in which players represent radio announcers moving from station to station across the USA. There is a &amp;quot;blue line&amp;quot; stretching from Bangor, Maine to San Francisco, California, which is the route followed by the first/third player(s). There is also a &amp;quot;red line&amp;quot; stretching from Miami, Florida to San Francisco, which is the route followed by the second/fourth player(s).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
