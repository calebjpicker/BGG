						               													<description>Fox in the Henhouse is a micro-game for 2-4 players that can be played in 10-20 minutes. Each player is trying to accumulate the most Eggs (points) from their Hens. The Fox is a tricky scoundrel that shows up in all the wrong places and chases off the Hens and destroys their Eggs! It&amp;rsquo;s your job to keep the Fox out of your Henhouse and keep your Hens safe so they can produce as many Eggs as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Fox in the Henhouse, each player has only 1 card in their hand and two face down cards in front of them. The two face down cards are called your Henhouse. Hen cards have 1-4 Eggs shown on them. You are attempting to gather the most Eggs into your hand and Henhouse by the end of the Week (7 rounds). In addition to each player's hand and Henhouse are two face down cards in the center of the play area called the Field. On your turn you can select a card from anywhere on the table (cannot take a card from someone's hand).  Once you have selected a card, you can choose which of the two cards you now hold to keep and which to put back, then other players take turns following the same format of selecting a card and placing a card.  If a player selects a Fox card they must keep it in their hand unless they are also holding one of the 4 Fox repelling cards (The Farmer, The Farmwife, The Farm Dog or The Rooster).  The 4 Fox repelling cards also have special abilities when played face up to help you manipulate the cards in play.  At the end of the Week all players total up their Eggs and take the number of Egg tokens they have accumulated.  After 4 weeks have been played then the player with the most Eggs wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
