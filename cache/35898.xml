						               													<description>Back to Blighty is a diceless card game, which is played mainly with 4 decks of terrain cards and a player sheet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your plane is shot down over enemy occupied France and you manage to find a French family but you cannot stay there too long you must find the safe house.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6 different pilots with different characteristics to choose from 12 different routes that must be followed. You have 4 different terrain types, Countryside, road, river and railway. Traveling by night you pick a relevant card which has a distance and time these are moved along a track. The longer you are out the more tired you become, but you must find somewhere to rest before daylight comes. some cards are German soldiers but these may be avoided if the conditions are right, if you are challenged I hope your language skills are up to scratch and that the 6 days in the outdoors isn't going to give you away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tactical decisions include how long into the morning are you prepared to travel before you find somewhere to rest for the day, balance this with how good will you be if you were challenged by a German soldier. How far you have to travel before your safe compared to the fact the more days your out the more disheveled you look and therefor more suspicious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other things included are crossing rivers, swimming, boat, or bridge, weather which may change half way through the night. The heavier the rain the less likely you will be challenged but the less rest you will get. Going into a town to seek resistance members but beware the Gestapo and German sympathizers. Stamina, food, blending in, stealing a German soldiers push-bike all take a role.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
