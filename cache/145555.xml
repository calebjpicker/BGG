						               													<description>Tactics &amp;amp; Tachyons is a game of starship combat. It was designed to offer players a simple combat system for resolving large fleet actions between opposing starship forces within a reasonable block of time. T&amp;amp;T can also be used to resolve battles from a campaign setting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 2041 an alien space ship crashes in Washington state. Using that technology the USA develops humanity's first starships. In the meantime a cold war is brewing between the US and its allies and China and her allies. Habitable planets are discovered and in 2050 the exodus from humanity's cradle is on with the colonization of New Earth. Planets controlled by China and her allies secede from Earth and in 2126 Worlds War III begins. The Earth based states claim neutrality in the war. In 2128 with the war still unresolved an alien Starfleet attacks and captures Earth. With a tenuous truce arranged, the relief of Earth begins. The human fleets engage a new foe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game manual includes rules on movement, sensors, tachyon guns, torpedoes, probes, fighters, point defense, armor, tow beams, damage resolution and more. The rule book includes guidance for customization and the creation of your own ships. Four combat scenarios are included.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also included in the rule book are a number of items designed to be photocopied for play. These include ship fleets, torpedoes, fighter squadrons, ship design forms, ship log forms (both long and short) as well as several charts and tables. The game is played with stand D6 dice (a minimum of three are required).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A line of 1/2400 starships model kits in plastic were created by Detailed Casting Products.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
