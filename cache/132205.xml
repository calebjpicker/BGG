						               													<description>&amp;quot;Welcome to Brighton - a place where individuality is a competition, self- consciousness is an art form and nobody can hear the real world over the hum of cafetieres.  In short, the perfect setting for a day out.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You and up to four friends must travel the length and breadth of the city looking for interesting things to do and see. And adventure can be found in the most unlikely places.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the South Downs to Black Rock,the day is yours to spend as you please. You could explore the obvious sights or uncover hidden corners. You could stalk local celebrities or stumble upon resident legends. You could go busking or shopping, gambling or picnicking. You could be mugged in broad daylight or handed a flyer for the best party ever.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But you won&amp;rsquo;t know till you dive in, so what are you waiting for?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting at Brighton train station, each player takes a coloured pawn and their first Destination card. This is where they're supposed to visit first to score the associated points, but there's nothing to say they can't just explore off the beaten track and find adventure that way as well. Either approach will score Anecdote Points, which are the currency and aim of the game - score 50 Anecdote Points and get back to Brighton station, and you've won.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Moving around the board either on foot or using public transport such as trains, buses and taxis, players can discover local characters, eccentrics, celebrities and city events - some of these are activated immediately, others act as subquests for the players to compete for. As well as these encounters, players can also go shopping for a variety of items that will help them or protect them from the dastardly tricks that'll be played on them through the course of the game via the Sneak cards deck players can accrue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For instance, if you meet a local celebrity there's every chance another player will play a Lookalike card on you, so that celebrity was just a close likeness and therefore worth no points. If you trawl across the city to a destination miles away, a player may decide it's been closed for repairs. You might get a taxi only to be at the mercy of someone who doesn't know north from south, and end up streets away from where you intended.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combining the skills of maze orientation, inventory and money management, player interaction and risk assessment, BN1 also relies on a healthy dose of luck. And with over 100 different encounters, 40 odd unique destinations, a brace of shop items and a couple of dozen different Sneak cards, it's an expansive adventure with a high replay value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first edition of BN1, released at the start of November 2012, was a limited run of 500 hand-numbered copies. It's available from shops around Brighton, and also the Bedsit Games website). It is now in its 3rd edition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
