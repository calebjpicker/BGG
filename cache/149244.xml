						               													<description>Huey Leader puts you in the cockpits of the Vietnam War&amp;rsquo;s best Close Air Support aircraft. In Huey Leader, fly search and destroy missions to attack enemy troops, fly missions to deploy US ground troops into hostile Landing Zones and then provide Close Air Support to help the troops complete their mission, and even fly resupply missions to keep US Forward Bases supplied.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Huey Leader is based on our popular Thunderbolt-Apache Leader game system. If you've played TAL, you'll be up and flying missions against the Vietcong in minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridgeline to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&amp;rsquo;re flying!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You get to resolve every shot taken at you by enemy AAA, and every air to ground attack you make against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, APC, Infantry Squad, Machinegun Nest, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Vehicles, Troops, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy AAA assets first?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy targets before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it may not be able to fly for days.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Huey Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We&amp;rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Key Design Features: &amp;#10;An all-around excellent solitaire game. &amp;#10;Manage your pilots as well as your hardware to be a successful squadron commander. &amp;#10;Intuitive, fast-playing game system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Huey Leader includes the following aircraft:&amp;#10;UH-1 Iroquois&amp;#10;CH-47 Chinook&amp;#10;AH-1 Cobra&amp;#10;OH-6 Cayuse&amp;#10;A-1 Skyraider&amp;#10;AC-47 Spooky&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Component List:&amp;#10;165 Full Color Cards&amp;#10;2 Full Color Counter Sheets (352 counters)&amp;#10;3 Full Color Counter Sheets with Terrain Hexes (18 counters)&amp;#10;22&amp;rdquo; x 17&amp;rdquo; Full Color Tactical Sheet&amp;#10;1 Full Color Air Base Sheet&amp;#10;1 Full Color Player Log Sheet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scheduled Campaign List:&amp;#10;Westmoreland's War 1/1965&amp;#10;Operation Hump 10/1965&amp;#10;Khe Sanh 1/1968&amp;#10;Tet Offensive 1/1968&amp;#10;Easter Offensive 3/1972&amp;#10;And more!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Target Audience: &amp;#10;This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each campaign consists of 2 to 10 Days in which you&amp;rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each Day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
