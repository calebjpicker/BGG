						               													<description>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the world of The 7th Guest: The Board Game, you re-enter the mysterious and magical Stauf mansion, filled with diabolical puzzles, riddles and other mind games to test your wits and knowledge against your friends and family. But as with all haunted houses, know that you enter at your own risk. The goal is to emerge with your sanity - and your soul &amp;ndash; intact.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board game remains true to the original award winning computer game, although now you play the role of one of the six guests in direct competition with the other guests. Starting from the Foyer, you are randomly assigned destination rooms to which you must go, by roll of the Magic Die, and there, solve the mysteries and challenges within. Be the first to finish your tour of the mansion, arrive at the final destination, the Little Room at the Top, solve the final puzzle there, and you best your fellow guests and achieve your heart's most secret desire. Which, for one thing, is to best your fellow guests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The puzzle types range from logic puzzles, to spatial problems, to riddles and cryptic clues to trivia. You never know what you'll get. Some may be easy, but some may be real brain freezers. But Stauf, being a fair-minded host, has provided up to three hints for the more difficult problems. But using the hints comes at a price, naturally. Nothing is free, you know. And in Stauf's world, no good deed goes unpunished.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Note that whereas The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour had a little less than 90 logic puzzles &amp;amp; brain teasers between them, the basic tabletop game comes with 300, and that's just for starters.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And if you can't solve the puzzle put to you, the other guests will have a chance to &amp;ldquo;steal&amp;rdquo; it from you by answering it instead. So be vigilant and pay attention to not only your own puzzles, but to the puzzles put to your fellow guests. You might just walk away with the prize that was once within their grasp. How delicious is that?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It all sounds pretty simple and straightforward, doesn't it? Well, not quite so fast. Simple, maybe. But straightforward? That's not exactly the way of the diabolical game maker, who here, has devised a number of Mystery Spells that are cast upon his guests, making things just a little trickier... and lot more interesting. Should you land on a Mystery space, you might be sent someplace you don't want to be. Or, you might be assigned extra rooms to unlock. Or, somebody might gain the power to &amp;ldquo;Steal&amp;rdquo; the answer to your puzzle from right under your nose. Again, you never know what you're going to get. But Stauf is,if nothing else, an equal opportunity evil doer... so all those bad things that can be inflicted on you can be inflicted on your opponents too. And take heart... for every evil spell, there is a good one too. Stauf isn't totally evil. Right?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
