						               													<description>5 Different Count Dracula Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Free! Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;disposable games to scratch, play &amp;amp; throw away&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Objective:  You are in the dare dungeon of the infamous Count Dracula, searching for the famous treasure of jewels know the be hidden in his caskets.  The player who gets away with the most jewels of his own color by the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Preparation: Each player scratches one of the two skull eyes at the bottom of the game card to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; which color jewels they are seeking.  The &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; player is player number 1 and is searching for blue numbers representing sapphires.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; player is player number 2 and is searching for red numbers representing rubies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Play:  Player number 1 starts the game by scratching one of the six circles (hiding places) in the bottom of any of the caskets.  The following things may be discovered:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BLUE NUMBERS - You have discovered that many sapphires.&amp;#10;RED NUMBERS - You have discovered that many rubies.&amp;#10;BAT - You immediately lose your turn&amp;#10;CRUCIFIX - The value of all jewels in the casket doubles.&amp;#10;DRACULA - You awaken Dracula!  You must close the casket without taking out any of the jewels.  Immediately scratch off the three boxes in the lid and subtract one point from your score for each sapphire or ruby found in that casket so far.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player may continue his turn as long as he wishes.   But, when the player uncovers a bat or a Dracula, it then becomes the opponent's turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To collect the jewels discovered in the casket, you must be the player who successfully &amp;quot;closes&amp;quot; the casket's lid.  When the casket is closed, the other player's jewels and any remaining uncovered treasure are lost forever.  Remember, no points are scored until the lid is closed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You may attempt to close a casket at any time as long as at least one hiding place has been scratched.  To close a casket, search for the word &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; in one of the three boxes in the casket's lid.  Uncovering a &amp;quot;squeak&amp;quot; in the lid caused the player to lose his turn and the casket remains open.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you close a casket, chisel the score on your tombstone scoring area.  When all caskets are closed, the game is over.  The player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
