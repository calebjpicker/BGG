						               													<description>On November 6th, 1861, rebels in Columbus, Kentucky, celebrated the election of President Jefferson Davis. That same day, General Ulysses S. Grant moved against General Polk on the opposite side of the Mississippi. This was to be Grant's first aggressive action of the war. Grant landed 3,000 men, supported by artillery and cavalry two miles southeast of the Confederate Camp Johnson and the tiny village of Belmont. Correctly identifying the gathering smoke from Grant&amp;rsquo;s little fleet, Polk still vacillated before dispatching General Pillow and four Tennessee Regiments to reinforce General Tappan&amp;rsquo;s Arkansans on the Missouri side of the river. U.S. Commander Walke led his gunboats into a brief artillery battle with the Iron Banks batteries but soon withdrew his battered vessels. By 8;30 a.m. Grant marched on the rebel Camp. By 10:00 am the battle commenced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Soldiers fought across heavy woods, clear fields and cornfields. Pillow showed poor judgement. In short order his demoralized men retreated north and south of their camp while the Yankees celebrated their victory. Grant briefly lost control. His officers and men ignored him as they looted the abandoned camp. General McClernand even took time to mount a stump and give a political speech. Finally roused to action, Polk ordered his Iron banks batteries to fire on Camp Johnson as General Cheatham and five additional regiments shuttled across the river. Exposed Union companies were decimated by the re-energized confederates. Many Northerners had their retreat cut off. The fight continued all the way back to the ships. Grant found himself the last man aboard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Belmont&amp;rsquo;s butcher bill left 320 Union dead, 400 wounded &amp;ndash; 100 of whom were captured along with another 100 healthy men. The confederates lost 105 killed, 419 wounded and 117 missing. Despite the casualties the battle was ultimately inconclusive and both sides claimed victory. Grant captured and destroyed an enemy camp but at a horrendous cost. On the other hand, Polk and Pillow showed hesitation and poor judgement something Grant would use against them in later battles. The rebels had forced Grant and his Yankees to quit the field only after he had created a core of skilled veterans displaying the courage and determination eventually to earn him command of all the Union forces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Belmont is to be a COMPASS, PAPER WARS Magazine game based on John Poniske's Ball's Bluff design &amp;hellip; significantly expanded. This is a two player, hex-based game on the company level. It offers a 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; Map (Created by Rick Barber), 226 9/16&amp;quot; counters (Featuring the artistry of Bill Morgal, 1 Rulebook and Player Aids. It is a chit-draw system with a unique see-saw Confused Orders mechanic which simulates the confusion of ACW battle. The game employs infantry, artillery, cavalry and gunboat rules. Players involve their troops in three types of battle, Volley Fire, Passing Fire and Melee. To enhance battlefield confusion, advancing into melee may cause loss of control and further advance than a player wishes. Grant's aggressive nature is simulated by a limited number of rerolls within his leadership range.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From Compass Games Website (https://www.compassgames.com/paperwars/issue-87-magazine-game-belmont.html):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Paper Wars Issue #87 (Fall 2017 issue) (Magazine &amp;amp; Game)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Belmont &amp;ndash; Grant's [Baptism of Command], November 7, 1861&amp;quot;, by John Poniske&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Ulysses Grant &amp;ndash; who is he? Prior to the battle of Belmont at Belmont on November 7, 1861, this was a valid question. General Grant&amp;rsquo;s Belmont offensive was his first action in the war, providing him and his green mid-western troops much-needed experience. Having overrun a rebel camp, he claimed victory. But later, Confederate general Polk would claim victory for forcing Grant and his troops to quit the battlefield and chasing them aboard their transports.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Complexity: Medium&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire suitability: High&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Map scale: 225 yards/hex&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unit scale: Company&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 Map and 1 Countersheet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
