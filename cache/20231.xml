						               													<description>In this game the players take over the roles of archeologists who are exploring a pyramid. Their goal is to find canopic jars and, ultimately, treasures. The first player to find and secure his treasure wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pyramid, which is about to be explored, is built with the help of cards. All of these cards are placed face down in a 6x6 grid. Around half of the grid is built by light cards which cannot hide jars or treasures, the other half consists of darker tiles and are placed deeper inside the pyramid. Every player can spend 5 movement points. It costs 2 movement points to move through an undiscovered tile, but only one movement point to walk across a discovered tile. Players are not allowed to move diagonally and must always show their opponents the way they wish to take. Although moving through discovered tiles is faster, it can also be less handy and dangerous as you might not only discover a simple corridor but also a trap. Cards are used to move, look at undiscovered tiles or attack your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as the first player discovers a canopic jar, the mummy awakes and starts to wander the pyramid. The mummy is moved by the different players and can be used to prevent an archaelogist from leaving the pyramid with a valuable artefact. When the mummy attacks, all items the attacked player has in his backpack are lost and returned to the pyramid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player successfully leaves the pyramid with a jar, the card is taken out of the game and cannot be taken away from the player again. To prevent players from securing their treasures, other players can steal items or attack opponents to make them lose an object.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the back of the game box:&amp;#10;You are on the verge of meeting the greatest challenge an archaelogists could ever be faced with:&amp;#10;Krimsutep's Pyramid&amp;#10;Legendary treasures are said to be hidden inside the pyramid, but be careful. Legends speak of a curse that will be put on anybody who dares to enter the pyramid and tries to reveal its secrets. Not only does the structure of the pyramid pose a problem to eager archaelogists, but also the pharao himself does not wish to be disturbed. &amp;#10;Who will be the first to find the legendary treasures of Krimsutep and get them to safety?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
