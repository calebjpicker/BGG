						               													<description>A political game where a player plays as a party in a town called Brige in Europe, 1915. His goal is to attract as many followers to support his party by moving across the map of Brige. The game begins with the overthrow of Major of Brige, and ends in 1918, the end of WW2, when order is brought back to the town and elections take place. The party with the most voters wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is consisted of a main board map (the town of Brige), Personal Board- these boards give information about the party's current stand. Their content is changed along the game as the party is influenced by the player's decisions, and other effects . In addition, there are &amp;quot;Point of Interest&amp;quot; cards that resemble an encounter with a citizen or an event that is happening that requires the party's decision. Whenever a player lands on a Point of Interest, he takes a card from the pile and must act according to the type of event at hand, and organize his position after reading the consequences. The face of the cards is where the information about the event is given, with the available decisions &amp;amp; options at its bottom. On the back of the card is where the decision's effect is shown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Along the game, a party may hire citizens that it encounters and turn them into &amp;quot;Agents&amp;quot;. Once this is done, the player places a figure on the board. Agents are the connecting bridge between the players, and allows a party to make contact with other parties. Every agent has its own skill and have specific actions that can be done with them. A Gunman for example, may attack other units on the board, including the party leader that will lose the player's game if is assasinated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An important aspect in the game is money. The game currency is called &amp;quot;Brigs&amp;quot;, and is affected by the current information on the player's Personal Board, or throught drawn Point of Interest cards. Without money, an agent can't be paid, some actions can't be made, and the player will most likely have few units on the board, what makes him vulnerable to Gunmans. The player must carefuly plan his campaign in order to make sure he doesn't fall into issues such as this.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
