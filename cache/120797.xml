						               													<description>&amp;quot;Morph it. The Squishy Squashy Dough Modelling Game!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the back of the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;It's charades... but not as you know it!&amp;#10;Every mime must be acted out with the help of your trusty friends Morph and Chas - plus the aid of a lump of dough, of course!&amp;#10;It's a terrific team game, where everybody does their bit in a frantic race against the clock.&amp;#10;Do you go for the easy 'mime' that will ensure you move forward - or gamble it all on a difficult one that could all go horribly wrong?!&amp;#10;Racing around the board, it will be the first team that can catch and overhaul their opponents that'll be the winners... no time to waste, get moulding!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Morph and Chas are stop-motion plasticine characters produced by Aardman Animations (who later went on to make Wallace and Gromit), who appeared with Tony Hart on childrens' TV in the UK in the 1970s and 80s, notably on the programmes Take Hart and Hartbeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played by two teams. One team gets the Morph pieces and the other team the Chas pieces, and they start 6 spaces apart on the 12-space board track. Each card includes 6 words or phrases describing an action or pose (3 on each side, ranked 1/2/3 in order of difficulty).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The active player chooses one and in one minute has to get their team to guess the action or pose using their figure, the modelling dough, and Yes/No answers to any questions their team asks. Depending on success or failure, they then advance or retreat a number of spaces along the score track equal to the difficulty rank of the item they chose. There are also two &amp;quot;All play&amp;quot; spaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winning team is the first to catch up with the other team on the track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
