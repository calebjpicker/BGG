						               													<description>Every player produces farm products and tries to sell them as well as possible. The more products of a kind a player has on his player table, the higher is the reward from the 'harvest'. Unfortunately, however, a player is often forced to sell his product at dump prices too early. And sometimes a harvest yields nothing at all. The aim of the game is to earn the most coins from the trade in farm products.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, you grow vegetables and farm animals on your fields to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random produce cards. Each card has a picture of the product, cow, sheep, cabbage, sunflower etc, and numbers showing how many cards of that type you need to harvest at a time to get that amount of coins. You are not allowed to change the order of the cards in your hand. You play them in that order &amp;ndash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is an essential part of the game.&amp;#10;During your turn you place one or two cards on your two fields in front of you, indicated on your personal play board. During the game you can buy a third field for your use. Each field can produce only one product &amp;ndash; sheep, pumpkins etc. If you do not have space to do the required action of placing a product on your fields, you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. More cards on the field, more coins while harvesting.&amp;#10;Next, you take two cards from the deck and place them open on the table. You can take these cards for your own fields, or you can trade them or give them away &amp;ndash; if anyone takes them. You can also trade cards from your hand, but all trading has to be done with the player in turn. No traded cards go back to hand. They all must be played to the fields after trading phase.&amp;#10;Finally, you take three and place them in the back of your hand. In the order you draw them.&amp;#10;The game ends when the draw pile has been used up for the third time. Who ever has the most coins wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
