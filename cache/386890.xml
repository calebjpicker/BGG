						               													<description>A set of 15 different Team decks, the majority composed of 6 cards each, for a total of 92 cards!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     X-Force&amp;#10;     West Coast Avengers&amp;#10;     Savage Avengers&amp;#10;     Resistance Against Apocalypse&amp;#10;     Illuminati&amp;#10;     X-Factor&amp;#10;     Excalibur&amp;#10;     New Mutants&amp;#10;     Infinity Watch&amp;#10;     Inhumans&amp;#10;     Fantastic Four&amp;#10;     Force Works&amp;#10;     Defenders (Manhattan)&amp;#10;     Marvel Knights&amp;#10;     Alpha Flight&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When adding a Team Deck to your game, all Heroes being used must be part of the same Team, and the Hard Challenge difficulty level should be used. That Team deck is shuffled and placed facedown within view of all players, with 2 cards revealed to form the Team Display. These are essentially Hero cards, with Action symbols at the bottom and a Special Effect. On their turn, a Hero can choose to either play a regular turn or they can choose to play a Team turn. In that case they don&amp;rsquo;t touch their Hero cards (neither drawing nor playing) but choose instead one of the Team cards in the Display and play that card in the Storyline, as if it were their own card. Immediately a new card is drawn from the deck to fill the Team Display (until the deck runs out). This not only brings a different flavor to the match, but also gives Hero more options of what to do on their turn. However, there is a downside to playing as a Team. Most Team decks have at least one card with a mandatory negative effect. This is in effect as long as that card is faceup on the Team Display. In order to shut it down, a Hero must take one for the team by taking a Team turn, choosing the negative card, and playing it facedown in the Storyline. There&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; in Team!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All Teams in this set require the use of Heroes who are part of exclusive expansions or Stretch Goals from previous campaigns, which is why we&amp;rsquo;re offering them as an exclusive Optional Buy, so backers can decide whether they want it or not. In the lists below, these exclusive characters are shown in italics. Although, of course, most of these Teams also have additional members which are part of boxes that are (or will be) available on retail. Also note that many of those Teams might still be bolstered by Heroes revealed over the course of the Multiverse campaign.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from Kickstarter campaign&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
