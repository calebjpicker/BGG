						               													<description>You and your fellow players are mushroom hunters. You're attempting to go out onto the mushroom mountain and bring back the most mushrooms, while also selling them for the best price at market. Mushroom Hunters is played using colored meeples, curved mushroom cards, and flat price cards. Who will be the best mushroom hunter?!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Initial setup of the game requires mixing up all of the curved mushroom cards and kind of shoving them into a big pile (aka mushroom mountain). Then shuffle all of the market / price cards and deal the top five face up and place the rest in a deck face down (which I messed up for this picture, oops!). Each player gets all 5 of their specified meeple color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each player's turn, they can take one of the following three actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) Place one of your meeples on any ONE mushroom card on mushroom mountain. The meeple must have both feet touching the card and must be STANDING in order to count. If it falls, I think you must remove it from mushroom mountain and your turn ends with no properly placed meeple mushroom hunters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) Return any ONE of your meeples, along with the card it is standing on, to your play area. The number of mushrooms on the card is the number that you have collected.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3) Return ALL of your meeples, along with the cards that they were standing on, to your play area. The number of mushrooms on ALL of these cards is the number that you have collected.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At any time during your turn, you can cash in any amount of mushrooms you have collected during the current or previous turns for a market / price card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues until either all of the market / sell cards have been taken by players, or all of the cards from mushroom mountain have been taken. Once the end is triggered, players count up their money and the player who has earned the most from their mushroom hunting adventure is declared the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
