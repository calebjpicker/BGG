						               													<description>Metro City Meltdown is a co-operative disaster management game for 1-4 players, which takes around 1 hour to play.&amp;#10;Taking place over 8 days, can you and your team protect and serve a city gone crazy and leave it whole at the end of your term? Sounds easy? Budget restraints, wild weather  and angry citizens all contribute to the city&amp;rsquo;s decline. &amp;#10;Oh and don't get me started on the 100 foot tall dinosaurs or flying saucers...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place over 8 game days and players take the roles of city officials trying to protect the city from damage, rioting and disease.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players use their city budgets to put crews into the city blocks to counter the news events that bring further disaster and ruin to the streets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you can survive to the end of your watch and have most of the city still up and running you win as a team. But lose too many city blocks or too many citizens to disease rioting or other dangers and you are fired and removed from office.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Player has a set of budget dice and there are federal budget dice which are divided among players according to the needs of the city.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your budget can be assigned to actions to counter damage that takes place during the game. (Each round event cards dictate the headlines for that round and the damage that is caused). &amp;#10;These actions could be to put out fires, heal the diseased, control unruly citizens repair infrastructure and reconnecting utilities. Be careful though you also need budget to move your work crews around the city.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If any of these issues get out of control they can spread very quickly. Losing 3 city blocks or all of the damage counters of any type results in instant dismissal from the City Disaster council and disgrace for your team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Watch your HQ as well if that burns down or is damaged beyond repair the same result can take place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With 4 difficulty levels this game can be a light entertaining game right through to nearly impossible odds. This might seem repressive but beating the game on Expert level is a great boost.&amp;#10; Solo play can be played in the normal way but the Solo story mode involves scenarios that build upon each other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
