						               													<description>In Pretpark Tempo you build your own theme park and try to accommodate to the wishes of potential visitors as good as possible. Will you manage to attract more visitors than the other players?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pretpark Tempo is a card-drafting game with a unique twist. Cards can be played as an attraction or as a potential visitor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of two phases. The first phase lasts two rounds. Every turn each player chooses two cards form their hand and then pass the remaining cards to an adjacent player. All players simultaneously show which card they play as an attraction, place it in front of them and activate its special ability. All build attractions stay in play in front of each player to form their own theme park. Attractions all have a type and a theme which contribute to attracting visitors in the second phase of the game. The second card chosen is placed face-down in a shared pile which is called &amp;quot;the visitors' row&amp;quot;. All visitors in this pile will make their appearance in the second phase of the game to choose a theme park to visit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whenever one or more players have no cards to pass to an adjacent player - the round ends. A new hand of cards is dealt to each player and a new round starts. After two rounds the first phase of the game comes to an end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second phase of the game the visitors in the visitor' row are revealed one by one. All visitors have a preference toward a certain theme and type of attraction. Players compare their theme parks to find out who has a majority in attractions that are preferred by the visitor to decide which player attracts the visitor. After all visitors are assigned you count how many visitors came to visit your park and add bonus points for your attractions with certain special abilities. The player with the most points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pretpark Tempo is a contest for majorities. Therefore, it is essential to keep close track of what your opponents are building and make well-considered decisions during the drafts. It plays best with 3-5 players but also contains a solid ruleset for a 2-player game and a solo variant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
