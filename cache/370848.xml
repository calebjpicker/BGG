						               													<description>In Statefall, you are given command over a randomly assembled army group. It&amp;rsquo;s your mission as the commanding General to get the most out of the units at your disposal. To anticipate and deal with each new enemy move and to secure control over the state!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game features a starting sequence, that generate a wide variety of scenarios to deal with, both in environmental obstacles and army group compositions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The army group consisting of 8 units is drawn from 15 available units for each player. Divided into 11 different unit types, beloning to one of four categories. Attack, defence, support and Control.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attack units, Mortar(2), Tank(3), Infantry, Marine, Fighter, and Sapper. Each attack unit has their own unique ability to attack enemy units on the board, thereby fliping owenership of the attacked targets and increasing your control over the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Defence units, Minefield and Anti-Air will together with environmental river tiles and the coastline, help you to protect high value control units from enemy attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Support units, Logistics, may allow you to reactivate previously committed attack units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Control tiles, Capital, Suburb and Rural(2), will give you an increased level of control given owenership and certain criterias. These are high value targets and should be defended if possible!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle sequence will see both players take turns, playing one unit card from their hand, followed be placing the corresponding unit tile on the board, next to an already placed unit. This continues until both players have committed all their 8 units to the battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scoring sequence is comprised of two stages. Each player will start by counting each unit tile under their control. The next step is to look at any control units on the board, Capital, Suburbs and Rurals. These may give a lot of additional control-points to the owner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the highest amount of control-points is the winner of the battle!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
