						               													<description>Introduction&amp;#10;You and your fellows have reached the city of Memoria, this mythical territory where snatches of memories come back to the mind of those who come in. Unfortunately, only one of you will be allowed to leave the city with his/her &amp;laquo; new &amp;raquo; memories. To be the chosen one, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to tell a memory or a lie while messing up with your companions&amp;rsquo; minds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to tell a memory based on random pictures. If you don&amp;rsquo;t remember any memory with these pictures, you can still bluff creating a false memory, but try to be convincing! Indeed, to score points when you are the Speaker, you have to mislead the other players (in other words you must make them believe your memory is false when in fact it is true, or true when it is actually false).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ROUND 1&amp;#10;IN THE HEART OF THE CITY&amp;#10;You penetrate the heart of Memoria city. Snatches are springing up everywhere. Choose carefully the ones you&amp;rsquo;ll associate to tell or reinvente your story.&amp;#10;1) Everybody has 90 seconds to remember or to imagine a memory with the six visible cards (you can use your phone timer or leave it up to players to decide when they are ready to tell a memory). You don&amp;rsquo;t have to include the whole six cards to your memory. It is possible to tell a memory using only one card out of the six ones you picked.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) Once everybody&amp;rsquo;s ready, the older player is designated as the Speaker. Then, he places in front of him and face down his &amp;laquo; Bluff &amp;raquo; card if he&amp;rsquo;s going to lie or his &amp;laquo; Memoria &amp;raquo; card, if he&amp;rsquo;s going to tell the truth. Then, he declares the number of pictures he&amp;rsquo;ll use in his memory and then tells it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3) Once his memory has been told, each player (beginning with the player who is placed on his left) can ask a question to the Speaker if he wants to, in order to gather more information, or to unsettle him to see how he&amp;rsquo;ll react (If the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s memory is true, he has to answer the questions honestly. If his memory is false, he can tell what he wants).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4) Then, each player has to decide if the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s memory was true or false, placing his Memoria or Bluff card in front of him (His Memoria card if he thinks it was true, his Bluff card, if he thinks it was a lie).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5) Then, beginning with the player placed on the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s left, each player reveals his card, explaining if he wants to, why he believed or not in the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s memory. Then, the Speaker shows his own &amp;laquo; Memoria &amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo; Bluff &amp;raquo; card et gives some details about his story if he wants to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6) Then, you have to count the points (see the following paragraph &amp;laquo; How to count points &amp;raquo;).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7) Then, the player who was sitting on the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s left becomes the Speaker, and so on and so forth until everybody&amp;rsquo;s been Speaker once.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;8) Once the round is over, the 6 used &amp;laquo; Snatch &amp;raquo; cards are discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ROUND 2&amp;#10;ON YOUR WAY BACK&amp;#10;It&amp;rsquo;s time to go back. You and your adventure fellows are about to leave the city of Memoria. Some snatches are still springing but soon, everything will turn back to the way it was before entering the city... However, one of you will have the privilege to keep in mind his new memories. But who ?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) The Speaker draws the first &amp;laquo; Snatch &amp;raquo; card from the deck and has 45 seconds to remember or imagine a memory linked to this card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) He puts his &amp;laquo; Memoria &amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo; Bluff &amp;raquo; card in front of him and tells his memory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3) The other players use their &amp;laquo; Memoria &amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo; Bluff &amp;raquo; card to decide if the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s memory was true or false. Contrary to the first round, they can&amp;rsquo;t ask him any questions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4) The Speaker scores 3 points for each player who was wrong about his memory. The other players scores 3 points if they were right about the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s memory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5) The drawn &amp;laquo; Snatch &amp;raquo; card is discarded and replaced with another one. Then, the player who was sitting on the Speaker&amp;rsquo;s left becomes the Speaker, and so on and so forth until everybody&amp;rsquo;s been Speaker twice during this round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6) The game is over ! It&amp;rsquo;s time for you and your fellows to leave Memoria city. The one who has the highest score keeps his new memories with him. In case of a tie, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to go back to the city to decide who is the worthiest time traveller.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
