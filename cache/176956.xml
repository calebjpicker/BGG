						               													<description>Near FUKA, EGYPT, 30 June 1942: All Axis supply traffic in North Africa moved eastward along the Via Balbia, the coast road that stretched from El Alamein to Tripoli. Rommel depended on this lifeline for his supplies, well known to the Allied command. For the first time, British fighter-bombers roar overhead looking for prey. As the Gazala positions crumbled, Rommel pushed his men and machines ever eastward along the Via Balbia, in pursuit of what he thought was a beaten enemy. Rommel's best troops raced forward in the van. Italian units followed behind. The Desert Fox knew the enemy was in disarray. Rommel also knew British supply lines and the ability to move units into the front line improved with every retrograde mile they retreated. The Italian XX Corps began moving east along the Via Balbia late on June 30, heading for participation in Rommel's last ditch attempt to reach Alexandria. Their trip would not go without incident as the British suddenly appeared from the desert flank, precipitating a vicious firefight. Their tormentors were units of the British 7th Motorized Brigade, sent forward to buy time for a new line to be formed at El Alamein. The quick-hitting unit handled the Italians roughly before pulling up stakes and moving off. The resulting Axis losses were not serious in terms of manpower. They were in terms of the time bought by tying up the coast road...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: Along the Via Balbia is a detailed new ASLComp VARIANT that tells the story of the War in North Africa. It's about time the desert warfare goodness that was spawned by Hal Hock's seminal work TOBRUK back in 1975... was brought to the gaming tables of ASLers. And now it is, in a big way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The tenth portion of the set-piece is ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS: Along the Via Balbia is a mixed date set of scenarios meant to depict the back-and-forth of the campaign with actions ranging from Fort Pilastrino to Fuka, with some additional Bir Hacheim and Bedja Pass in between. This set of 8 scenarios brings fort and village overlays into play, providing some interesting positional warfare to your wide-open desert gaming.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You receive a set of 8 scenarios, all depicting actions from the exciting offensive, rife with combined-arms actions. And yes, these are aimed at playability. Slap them down, bang them out, do it again. And again. Please do a little hooting and hollering while you're at it... at least when you roll 'snakeyes' (or the other guy rolls 'boxcars').&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
