						               													<description>Childrens card game based on the nursery rhyme.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object is to collect 10 cards comprising of The Old Woman and her nine children.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To play, spread all the cards face downwards on the floor or table. The youngest player begins by turning over one card face upwards. If the card is the Old Woman the player may place this card in front of him. He may then turn over another card to try to get the next card in sequence. When he fails he must leave the card face upwards on the table. The next player turns one card upwards and must also have the Old Woman card to start. The player may choose any of the cards on the table or floor whether these are face up or face down.&amp;#10;When a player has his Old Woman card in front of him, on his next turn he must try to look for a card showing a picture of a little baby. Next time he must find a picture of a child card that is slightly larger in size. To do this he can turn over another card or choose from the cards already on show. He must start with his Old Woman Card, then the little baby and then a slightly larger child until he has 10 cards in front of him. Each card will match up if chosen correctly as part of the picture overlaps from one card to another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To finish, the winner is the first player to have the Old Woman and all her children in the correct sequence {A total of 10 cards). With two players, two sets of Old Woman and her children may be collected by each player to decide the winner {a total of 20 cards).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
