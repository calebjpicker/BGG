						               													<description>Your career is going really well: you started out as a ticket collector on a small railway, then you were a train driver and later, as a railway engineer, you also learned the ins and outs of track planning. Now you are the director of the Railway Development Company! You decide what length of main and branch lines you build, and how expensive or special the locomotives that you put on them will be. Be the most skilful rail network builder and get your favourite trains!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, players draw railway lines on the map sheet using their own colored markers. If you have several sections that are joined (they can also be branch lines!), you can redeem them for a train card with the same number as the number of stages. You can also earn extra points by matching different formations of shapes.&amp;#10;In each round you can decide to draw one line with your color. Or you can reserve two lines with dotted lines in your color which you can draw later and others cannot take from you. Or you can decide to use up your lines to buy train cards. If the lines spent for a train card match a face up shape bonus card you get extra points. &amp;#10;The game ends when there are no more empty lines on the map. Be careful because if you have lines left (dotted lines do not count) you get penalty points for each.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the train cards in the game show a real train type that some day (or even today) was used on the Hungarian railway lines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
