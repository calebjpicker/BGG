						               													<description>&amp;quot;No one can seem to remember exactly how it started or indeed how it ended. But it did&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now decades after the last war, mankind fights for survival on the battlefields of a post-apocalyptic earth. WARLANDS pits the last human survivors against each other and the unnatural horrors that breed in the wastelands and dead cities. Strap yourself in for high octane action from small scale skirmishes to epic battles, The WARLANDS sing with the screams of the dying and the roar of machines&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WARLANDS is a turbo-charged miniature game of cinematic combat set in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic earth. Where the last remnants of Man battle for supremacy and resources against mutants, the dead and each other! Where the warriors of the &amp;#10;wastelands want but one thing, the black gold, the guzzoline.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Warlands is a miniatures wargame involving vehicular combat in a post-apocalyptic (Road Warrior, Deathrace, Doomsday, etc. inspired) setting.  Players can build forces of weaponized cars, trucks, dune-buggies, bikes, walkers, as well as foot infantry.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay is quick and is alternating activation.  Players roll for initiative, and each activates a model, based on speed, where they move, shoot, accelerate, decelerate and perform special actions (emergency braking, bootlegger reverse, un-jam weapon, etc).  Once all activations have been performed the turn ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each vehicle type (Car, Truck, Buggie, Semi, Walker, etc) has their own special abilities and base attributes.  These include their speed and maneuverability, ability to absorb damage, and off-road capabilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shooting involves die rolling, where shooter must roll higher than a fixed target value, based on the target's current speed (the faster it's going, the harder it is to hit).  Models in very close range get extra bonuses to hit.  Shooting has critical success / failure mechanisms, where a success would be an auto hit and a failure results in a weapons jam.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Damage is modified by the target's armor and the weapons armor penetration value.  This will determine the target value for the dice rolled to damage the target.  Each target has a number of hit points.  Critical damage rolls result in special damage to a vehicle that can range from degrading its performance to outright destroying it in a ball of fire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Movement has compulsory movement to simulate momentum, and varies by the model type and current speed.  Each model has a number of 45 degree turns it's allowed within a turn and how far it must move in a straight line before it can turn again.  Special Maneuvers require a die roll to beat a target value, the roll is modified by the driver's skill, current vehicle speed and available turns the vehicle has.  Success generally means the vehicle can turn or maneuver any way it wants, failure results in random movement or total wipe-out of vehicle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scale is 20mm and is compatible with most die-cast toy cars (Matchbox, Hotwheels, etc.).  The line will include not only vehicles but blister packs of weapons and customization bitz to upgrade existing toy cars.  At first this seems odd for a miniatures wargaming scale, but the movement works well within a 4x4 table and being able to customize toy cars will be a hobby in itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
