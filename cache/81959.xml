						               													<description>A discard game for 2 players, using two standard decks, usually with identical backs but this is not strictly necessary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prepare two packs (to be played alternately in rounds) by discarding all Aces, separating into red and black piles and then swapping one red and black nine over, which becomes the [b]Comet[/b] in each pack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle one pack and deal 18 to each player, discarding the remaining 12. Play can now begin.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The starting player places a card of his choosing in the middle. This can be one or more of the same value. The other player must now put a card or cards of one greater value (i.e. 6s on 5s, Js on 10s, all cards must be the same rank); if they are unable to do so there is a 'stop'. As Kings are high (no Aces), a King will also force a stop. At which point the player who played last starts the run again with any card(s) of their choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of the game is to get rid of your cards, and scoring is&amp;#10;accumulative, with the winner in each round scoring the total number of pips in his opponent's hand (court cards score 10).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the comet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The comet is a wild card and can be played with a group or on its own. It always forces a stop.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player wins the round and his opponent still holds the comet, the winning player scores double (the comet will therefore count as 18 points).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player wins by playing the comet, he scores double also. If however a player wins the round by playing the comet as a 9, his score is quadrupled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[Rules taken from &amp;quot;The complete Book of Card Games&amp;quot; published by Hamlyn]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
