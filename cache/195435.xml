The Player will then compare his PO&amp;rsquo;s rank with the Career Success Table to determine how well his PO did? TO GLORY WE SAIL may be played with up to 4 Players if desired (see Multiplayer Rules at the end of these rules).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME FEATURES&amp;#10;SET SAILS FOR GLORY is filled with Napoleonic Naval Themes and Actions.
