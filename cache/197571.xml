						               													<description>Once upon a time there was a farm that grew Carob Beans. Carob Beans are grown as a cocoa substitute and for their vitamin value. Like any farm, this farm had rodents living on it. To be honest, it was infested with rats. Lots and lots of rats. For generations these rats had been eating the Carob Beans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The farmer had a beautiful wife that loved to bake. More than anything she liked to bake pies ...All kinds of tasty pies. As the hot pies came out of the oven she would put them on the window sill of their quaint little farm house to let them cool off and the sweet aroma of the freshly baked pies would waft across the whole farm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One day one of the rats noticed the pleasing fragrance and followed it all the way back the farm house. There he found a pie sitting at the window&amp;rsquo;s edge. He tried and tried as hard as he could but being just a single rat he could not move that pie off the window sill.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Not wanting to easily give up he quickly ran off to get some of his fellow rats with the promise of a piece of the pie if they would help him lift it off the window sill and carry it away. They were successful! ...Very, very successful! Over time they learned that different pies weighed different amounts and that they needed more rats to take the heavier pies. The rats also started forming groups or &amp;ldquo;crews&amp;rdquo; to try and steal the pies. They were becoming competitive, even among themselves, in their attempts to steal these delicious treats.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the human world news quickly spread of this odd phenomenon and they became know as...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Pie Rats of the Carob Bean Farm!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Pie Rats of the Carob Bean Farm each player takes on the role of a Captain of the Rats and tries to build a crew of not-so-loyal rats in an attempt to loot the farmer&amp;rsquo;s wife of as many of her pies as you can. The heavier the pie the more rats it takes to steal it, the more points it is worth. The Captain with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
