						               													<description>A card and board skirmish game for 2 players themed on renaissance warfare with Leonardo da Vinci style inventions. The setting is Italian City States at war circa 1490 - the Fivizzano are invading the Piombino.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play is conducted on a 16 x 16 square grid map. Each 8 x 8 section is referred to as a quadrant &amp;ndash; the 2 eastern quadrants are land, the 2 western quadrants are water. The 6 squares of the NE corner of the SW quadrant contain city squares -  the Port City commune of Piombino. The remainder of the map layout is determined at discretion of the players though most of the land spaces should be flat land with a few clumps of forests and mountains and a few solitary hills, villages, and swamps. &amp;#10;One road connects the city to a village or two and then goes off the map. A few Islands dot the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Terrain types will affect the movement of the different unit types.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 11 different unit types: Infantry, Engineers, Cavalry, Artillery, War Machine, Flying Machine, Fortification, Small Warship, Large Warship, Transport and Mine Field.  Each unit type has a move rating, hits score and range, and may have a special capability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players start with a pre-defined army comprising a mix of the various units.  The attacker (the Fivizzano) starts with his units in the bottom half of the Southern quadrants. In addition the Fivizzano gets one roll against the leader table and 4 rolls against the invention table &amp;ndash; these give advantages / enhancements that last for the duration of the battle. The defender (the Piombino) starts with units scattered in the Northern quadrants, one roll against the leader table and 6 against the invention table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a Tactics deck comprising cards that mostly give short duration benefits.  These cards can be used, when appropriate, to enhance your own actions or negate those of your opponent&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Draw Phase&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Draw 2 Tactics cards. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Move Phase&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Each of your Units may be moved once up to a number of spaces equal to its move rating. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attack Phase&amp;#10;&amp;#10;      Each of your units may make 1 attack vs. a target within its range. When attacking roll 1D10. On a roll of 7 or higher the attack is successful and the target loses 1 hit. A unit with zero hits is destroyed. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End Phase &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Max Hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Fivizzano win if they occupy 4 of the spaces of the city. &amp;#10;The Piombinos win if they destroy 20 or more units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
