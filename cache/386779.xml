						               													<description>Marvel fans can imagine an exciting Spider-Verse adventure with The Trouble Game: Spider-Man Across The Spider-Verse Part One edition board game! Players assemble their spider-team then move through Spider-Verses among the 3 different gameboard rings. The first player to get all of their team safely back Home wins. The Pop-O-Matic die roller determines how far a player can move, and if they can twist and turn any of the gameboard rings. Launch into action by lining up Portal spaces to move into another universe, but watch out for Spot spaces that can bump players back!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     TROUBLE GAME WITH SPIDER-VERSE THEME: It's a Spider-Man twist on the classic Trouble game! Players race their hero through the Spider-Verse to be the first one to get their team to the Goober and back Home&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     SPINNING GAMEBOARD: It's a different Trouble gameplay experience as players twist and turn 3 movable board rings to connect and unlock Portal spaces, move pawns through the rings, and block the competition&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     POP THE DICE: Players pop the iconic Pop-O-Matic die roller and take different actions depending on the number and symbol shown on the 2 dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     SPIDER-VERSE GAMEBOARD SPACES: Each space on the gameboard has players doing different actions, but they can only move through the rings by lining up the Portal spaces&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
