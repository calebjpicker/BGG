						               													<description>Coin Rugby is a dexterity game popular in Australia and New Zealand combining elements of Penny Hockey (aka Penny Football) and Shove Ha'penny. It is played on a rectangular table between two players with a single round coin (usually a 20 cent piece).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The table represents the field of play in a Rugby match, with the ends furthest from each other representing the try-lines. Players attempt to flick or shove the coin from one end of the table to the other in three moves. They begin their turn by placing the coin so that part of it overhangs the table at the end closest to them. They then hit it with the palm of their hand for their first move. If they shove the coin completely off the table, their opponent receives the coin and begins their turn as described. If the coin is still completely on the table after three moves their opponent begins their turn from wherever the coin ended up on the table. If however, the coin is shoved into a position where it partly overhangs the opposite end of the table, they may attempt to score a try. &amp;#10;To successfully score a try, a player must flick the overhanging coin into the air and catch it with one hand. Doing so will score 5 or 4 points (as per Rugby Union or Rugby League). The player may then attempt to kick a conversion, which is worth 3 or 2 points respectively. Their opponent must form the shape of a rugby goal with thumbs and forefingers. This may be done in the air or with their fists on the edge of the table, at the behest of the scoring player, but this must be done fairly and without moving once set. Then the player attempting the conversion spins the coin on the table. To attempt the &amp;quot;kick&amp;quot; they must place both fists on the table beyond the spinning coin and then catch it between their thumbs. With the coin between their thumbs they must then propel it over the goal made by their opponent. Regardless of outcome the opponent then receives the coin and begins their turn. &amp;#10;Play can be timed, end when a certain score is reached by one player, or end with a &amp;quot;mercy rule&amp;quot;, i.e., an agreed points differential.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
