						               													<description>Like many of the great interstellar conflict games of our time, the story centers around a war where one empire emerges victorious. The game of Commonwealth, however, immerses players into a universe where that war has already happened. In a galaxy not so far away from our own, the victor of this old war has endured for centuries after the last of their adversaries were completely extinguished. After some time though, the very heart of their species began to rot with the knowledge of their forefathers and the annihilation they had wreaked upon their galaxy. In penance, the children of the last race searched the stars endlessly for some form of redemption and reprieve from their ageless guilt. And the day soon came when they found it. In the form of a small galaxy outside their own, they discovered several infant races untouched by hyperspace travel, and untouched by war. The Ancients came to our galaxy and swore they would protect its inhabitants from the same fate that befell their own. And so they introduced peace and order to the Milky Way, for only the Commonwealth could unite all the galaxy's races and prevent them from descending into the endless abyss of battle. If you remember, this is not a story about a great war. This is a story determining how the next age of our galaxy will unfold. Will you protect the Commonwealth and quell all rebellion, or will you dissent and usher in the next age of empire dominance?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to the Commonwealth universe where three to six players clash economically, politically, militarily, and even covertly in an epic conflict that rides upon the ground-breaking game mechanic of simultaneous turns. By choosing one of twelve unique alien races, you will create customizable fleets, explore the galaxy coordinate by coordinate, acquire powerful technologies, and launch secret covert attacks that even your enemies (or friends) can't originate. For the more politically inclined players, the in-game government provides a dynamic experience that will test your mettle as you try orchestrate a series of legislative masterstrokes to cripple or empower the Commonwealth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All this to provide a real-time simulation of interstellar civilization and warfare at its finest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
