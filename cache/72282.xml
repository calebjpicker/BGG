						               													<description>Fantasy Chess is a blend of Traditional Chess and miniatures or role-playing game mechanics where you can co-occupy squares and use dice to determine capture outcomes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Develop new strategies and alter old ones as you experience familiar chess from a whole new angle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Traditional King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn pieces that move and check the same as traditional chess, but may move through their own ranks, carry pieces, fight for squares (with dice and statistic sheet) and MORE!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Start off with the basic game that teaches how to co-occupy squares (you can have up to three of your own pieces in square) and how to fight for the square (attack the enemy piece using two six sided die against your own dexterity.  If you inflict damage, it lowers the enemy piece's life points.)  If several pieces are in a combat square, they all get an attack.  If it doesn't resolve in one swing each, then combat is continued in the next person's turn.  This means that you can send in re-inforcements.  Each piece class has different dexterity and hit points and some have armor.  All of this is listed on an easy to read stat sheet with bubbles to fill in for damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Check is handled in traditional style of check and checkmate.  But there are times when you can actually go head to head with the king in his square and check mate him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The advanced game includes 4 more rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Withdrawal (escaping from a combat square)&amp;#10;    Healing (Bishops and Queens can heal damaged pieces)&amp;#10;    Forced Retreat (Queens can kick other pieces out of her square)&amp;#10;    Carrying (Knights can carry a pawn or a bishop and Rooks can carry anything except another rook or the king)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Advanced Tournament Games, winning pieces are declared veteran and they go up a rank either getting more hit points, do more damage or improve dexterity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fantasy Chess has the capacity for 4 player games.&amp;#10;Bump two Fantasy Chess boards next to each other and play ally with your partner with full use of both boards as you try to checkmate your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This can even be expanded into a 5+ player game by either bumping more boards together or having a Game Master who can run some home rule creature pieces as interference or aid to the two main players.  Try putting two rows of squares as a forest between the two boards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Chess game where your Knights can charge from Castles, Bishops can heal the injured, Six piece battles can be fought in a square, and you can bludgeon a King to death!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can obtain Fantasy Chess&amp;reg; from the official website:  www.shadowhex.com or at [www.kickstarter.com/projects/869058411/fantasy-chess-a-fight-for-the-square-chess-variant] until 7 Nov 2011.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
