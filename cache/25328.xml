						               													<description>from the Box for the Tee Pee Toys version: All the Thrills of a Big Game: Running Plays, Passing Plays, Kick-Offs, Punts, Field Goals, Punt Returns.You are the Quarterback! Choose your own Plays! Follow the rules of football. Players each roll dice, the numbers on the dice refer to sequence tables which determine the results of the play (one player rolls for offense, and the other rolls for defense). Before rolling the offensive player must state whether he is going to run, kick, or pass. The game consists of &amp;quot;Four Quarters&amp;quot; four sets of (20) plays each quarter. The player with the highest score at the end wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alternate version: Jr. Quarterback came with short game board, markers for downs and quarter of play, a cardboard football and a deck of 20 cards with plays. One quarter of play was one complete pass through the 20 plays card deck. Thus, the deck would be gone through twice per half and 4 times to complete one game. The offensive player would select a play. The card would be turned over to reveal the results. Following the rules of football i.e., 4 downs to gain 10 yards, 4 quarters of play, etc.) the ball would move up and down the field based on the play called and the associated gain or loss in yardage on the card associated with the play called. The plays that could be called were &amp;quot;left end&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;left tackle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;left guard&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;right end&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;right tackle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;right guard&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;short pass&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;long pass&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;punt&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;kickoff&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;field goal&amp;quot;. Each of the running plays had gains and losses as well as one fumble and a no gain. &amp;quot;Long pass&amp;quot; had four interceptions including one that was returned for a touchdown. &amp;quot;Long pass&amp;quot; also offered a touchdown. Short pass had a higher completion rate than long pass and only two interceptions. Jr. Quarterback is a fun game for two young players and can even be played by one. In my opinion ages elementary or for the adult who likes old school board games from a simpler time. Great game for teaching a young child the basics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
