						               													<description>The Club is a slightly satirical game about life in the fast lane - a board game about love and about people's need to meet one another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The whole game takes place in a nightclub and the game board is the dance floor. On their turn players push three new dancers to the dance floor from their own bar counter (edge of the game board) and as they come into play they push others towards the center of the dance floor. Once two dancers meet in the heat of the night they can be made into couples and the better the match the more players score. If only two of the four visible qualities match then the dancers have a one-night-stand which is not a very long term fun and is thus worth only one point. With three matching qualities the dancers actually like one another, start dating and that is worth four points. If all the four visible qualities match then the dancers get the &amp;quot;happily ever after&amp;quot; the one true love we all search for and thus it is worth full 5 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each dancer also has a secret quality that can and will alter the basic score. For example if a guy has a large... &amp;quot;personality&amp;quot; then the player gets two extra points unless the other dancer is drunk, because if she is she wouldn't notice the difference. Girl's beautiful roommate on the other hand only has a function in the one-night-stands and the fun the couple would have means now triple fun and thus the player gets triple points. There are 12 different secret qualities in the game ranging from heart-broken to those who still live with their mom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Occasionally the game gets spiced up by one of the three special characters in the game. Bouncer can remove any of the dancer from the game board where as a Rock Star walks into the game normally, but once (s)he has gathered a fan crowd and he's completely surrounded player can take the Rock Star and four adjacent dancers back to his hotel room and form two couples out of them. The bully is the guy who harasses women and picks a fight with men and once he enters the game his mere presence prevents any dancer next to him to be part of a couple.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end the player who has been the best cupido wins the game. In other words the best scorer wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
