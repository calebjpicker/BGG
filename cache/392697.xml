						               													<description>Arnhem, The Netherlands, 1944: 2 PARA&amp;rsquo;s chaplain is pinned down by German fire while trying to cross the street to get to injured soldiers. The commanding officer of A Company, Major Digby Tatham-Warter, runs to him and says, &amp;quot;Don't worry about the bullets, I've got an umbrella&amp;rdquo; before escorting him back across the street.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fields of Fire Volume III sees the long awaited introduction of the British to Ben Hull&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece of tactical infantry command. From the burning streets of Arnhem to war-torn Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in this new, stand-alone volume from the team behind Fields of Fire Deluxe Edition, we follow the 2nd Battalion of The Parachute Regiment, commonly known as &amp;ldquo;2 PARA,&amp;rdquo; across over 60 years of military history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As Britain&amp;rsquo;s elite Airborne Infantry, the Parachute Regiment are used as spearhead troops and are often inserted behind enemy lines, by parachute or in modern times by helicopter. Lightly equipped due to the nature of their insertion, they need all their training, resilience, and fighting spirit to survive until other units can fight their way to them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Highlights &amp;ndash; What&amp;rsquo;s New in Volume III&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     When the company radios fail, make do with more uniquely British options like bugles.&amp;#10;     Use unique British weaponry such as PIAT anti-tank weapons during WWII and vehicles like Scorpions and WMIK in the more modern theatres of the Falklands and Afghanistan.&amp;#10;     Urban Defensive missions! Fight amongst rubble and fires, and try to hold on to your pocket by whatever means necessary as the enemy attacks utilizing a completely new urban offensive enemy hierarchy chart.&amp;#10;     Experience the constraints of modern day combat as you try to determine whether groups of people and incoming vehicles are hostile or merely civilians going about their lives.&amp;#10;     Collapsing buildings, an enemy helicopter attack, special forces, mine-sweeping duties, night assaults, and much, much more!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
