						               													<description>Background&amp;#10; Zombie Masters uses the popular Zombie theme and adds some new twists to the Zombie games.&amp;#10; This time you take the role of a Zombie Master, who creates these &amp;quot;undead&amp;quot; bodies and sends them out to control the world. Everybody is wondering about why Zombies are driven to eat brrraiiiins... we will give you the answer! &amp;#10; We all know that knowledge is a drug for mankind (just ask Faust) - it's a drug for Zombies as well. Our Zombies don't want to live with a brain all the time and therefore, feed upon the Living to get there wits back. Of course, this process is very slow and it would take tons of Einstein brains to spark rational thinking in a Zombie. But who cares, if you are &amp;quot;undead&amp;quot; and have all the time in the world.  Additionally, if you are a very dedicated and strong human and have the (mis)fortune to get bitten and turned into a Zombie yourself, you may be lucky and retain some of your basic knowledge regarding routine tasks/skills. So a cop may be able to still fire a pistol - though much slower and maybe not very accurately or the Zombie nurse may still be able to perform the task of giving you an injection.&amp;#10; And naturally,  - intelligent brains are much more attractive to Zombies than &amp;bdquo;no-brainers&amp;ldquo;.  Thus, a special resource is made available to Zombie Masters: Beer! Too much beer makes human brains unattractive for Zombies and those people who drink a lot of beer are not eaten by Zombies. And  you,  of course, as an evil Zombie Master can have the beer infested people fight or work among Zombies as well - they simply will not notice it ;-)  &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;General game description&amp;#10; Zombie Masters is a game for two players, who fight for control of a city or other location. Each player represents a &amp;bdquo;Zombie Master&amp;ldquo;, who is able to create Zombies and control them to achieve his goals.&amp;#10; Zombie Masters tiles are used to build a strategy for this game. Each player choose a set of 30 unit- or character tiles and put them into a chosen order in five turn sets consisting of six cards each.&amp;#10; A game turn consists of the following actions:&amp;#10; 1) Produce Zombie Masters resources&amp;#10;2) Play Zombie tiles face down to locations you would like to attack&amp;#10;3) Players alternately put Zombies or Humans on the Zombie tiles&amp;#10;4) Turn over the tiles you like and place Zombies on them. Discard Zombies which are surplus or can't be played on the tile&amp;#10;5) Starting with Initiative 0, use the action of that tile or attack with it until all tiles have been used&amp;#10;6) Seize locations if there is no enemy Zombie or citizen left and at least one of your Zombies/Humans occupy the location&amp;#10;7) Continue to feed &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; Zombies&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Zombie Masters will include a base set of 30 tiles for two players as well as a whole lot of Zombies and the remote city of Riverview to battle for. More strategy boards, unit tiles, locations and Zombie/Human tokens will follow up in expansion and scenario packs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
