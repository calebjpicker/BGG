						               													<description>Mix! is a game of secret goals and tactical color theory, in which players compete to influence which of six paint colors will be applied to canvases in order to meet their own goals. This requires thoughtful play, as the control each player has over which colors are painted is indirect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is assigned a goal with two colors -- one color that will grant them points, and another that will cause them to lose points. A player's positive goal is public, while their negative goal is private. Players must work to influence the painting process so as to maximize their positive goal color, and minimize their negative goal color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course, this is easier said than done. Players can only affect the colors that are painted by controlling the location of a shared set of tokens on a color palette. These tokens are moved between sections of the palette by mixing together color cards from a communal pile that all players must play cards into. Players can also play action cards to affect the location of tokens, and the availability of color cards to mix.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Timing is a critical aspect of Mix!, as players can only take one of three possible actions each turn -- either combining color cards to influence the palette, taking on new bonus objectives, or painting. Painting results in all players gaining and losing points based on the state of the palette, and also allows players to complete their bonus objectives. As a result, players must choose carefully when to work to influence the palette versus when to paint, in order to maximize their own gains while minimizing those of their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, private goals are revealed, and the player with the most points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
