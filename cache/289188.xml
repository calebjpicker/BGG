						               													<description>You&amp;rsquo;ll be in charge of sending out attacks, setting up defenses, running side businesses, managing your organization&amp;rsquo;s money, trading goods, making alliances &amp;amp; deceiving enemies. This is a headquarters defense/money management game where each decision you make has a consequence. Anything goes in this game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A turn consists of players using money they've earned to play 2 cards from their hand of 5 cards. Once the 2 cards are played and replaced from the deck, their turn is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Depending on what two cards were played a variety of things could have  happened. If someone played a criminal activity or trade card, they got money from either the black market or another player. If a defense card was played then it was used to defend the headquarters or a business. If an offense card was played then another player was attacked. If a business card was played then the player gained a new way to generate money each turn. All this while negotiating deals with other players and trading cards and money. And any deals made, can be broken. This is the criminal underworld after all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        HOW TO WIN&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of the game is to be the last player standing. Do this by eliminating all other criminal organizations. You eliminate a criminal organization by bringing their power down to zero. Once all other players are eliminated you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        GAME STORY&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The criminal underworld of Palm City has been operating without interruption since the city was first founded. The criminal way of life is sewn into the fabric of these people&amp;rsquo;s culture. Due to this, both the city and the criminal underworld within it have thrived. Leaving plenty of room for each sector of crime to have its own fully operational organization with its own established leader. All cyber crimes are initiated by the Shadow Crew. Weapons coming into the city go through Hell&amp;rsquo;s Angels. Drugs are manufactured and distributed by Los Zetas. Protection is given to businesses from the Buscetta Family. The art of assassinations are strictly Yamiguchi-Gumi. And lastly prostitution is an option in this city. The girls are protected and managed by The Richardson Gang. That was before, this is now. Business can only get so good without expansion, and with the city&amp;rsquo;s potential capped out, there is only one option for bringing in more money. Start dipping into the other sectors of crime. With the Buscetta Family selling drugs and Shadow Crew dealing weapons it is only a matter of time until someone feels like they&amp;rsquo;ve been wronged. A matter of time until they feel their piece of the pie is getting smaller. That&amp;rsquo;s when war begins. And when the dust settles, only one organization will be left standing. Times are changing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to the Criminal Underworld.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
