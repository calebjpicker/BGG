						               													<description>We write the second age in the year 160.&amp;#10;It all began with a prophecy interpreted by the oracle in the capital, Skjellsburg.&amp;#10;The village Dorntal was the center of the action. Unfortunately, the idiom was the prophecy&amp;#10;unclear and therefore difficult to interpret.&amp;#10;The King therefore gave magician Ilidor the order to speak a spell wards of protection to the Village to protect the kingdom from possible dangers.&amp;#10;Dorntal was a small village where everyone knew each other. There was a nice market around the playhouse with delicacies from the entire kingdom. Down by the river lived the fishermen, carpenters, blacksmith and several other artisans. During the day, people in the village went to work and in the evening they met at the inn to dine and play together. The fire crackled in the fireplace of the tavern and the people told each other Candlelight stories, genuine and invented, exciting and funny. And everyone listened. It was a nice feeling to be a part of this village community&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unfortunately, this inner and outer peace did not last long.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Due to a failed magic experiment Ilidors in the black tower, this protective magic weakened. The magician Illidor could do nothing more. He turned away from Dorntal and left the black tower at dawn the next day. A note on the wooden door with the words &amp;quot;Portals, Chaos, II-260, Save Yourselves !!!&amp;quot; was the only one what he left behind. What did Ilidor want to say with that? Had Illidor been able to decode the prophecy? Would the protective magic completely collapse in the second age in 260?&amp;#10;Even the dwarfs, elves, and other races now spoke in fear of the imminent end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In For the Kingdom, players assume the role of one of the backward houses in the village of Dorntal. By inserting the individual workers, different actions are played out. The mining of raw materials, the procurement of money, the improvement of the workers or the hiring of Heroes are dedicated solely to defending Dorntal and protecting the kingdom. In Farek's Forge, magnificent items can be forged to fight within and outside Dorntal. Face different Quests. Some Quests can be done alone, but others can be done together. The player with the most points wins. However, if the village is damaged / loses morality too much, you lose the game together. But beware: Humans, Orcs, Dragons or Goblins lurk dangerously around Dorntal. The sun sinks on the horizon with increasing speed, so hurry up! It is time: for the people, for the king, FOR THE KINGDOM!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
