						               													<description>In It's on me!, players have ingredient cards for making cocktails and recipes for those cocktails. There is also a common deck of ingredients.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, players have the opportunity to draft ingredients out of the common deck and replace with other cards from their personal ingredient pool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will discard recipe cards and then ingredients are revealed from the common pool. If no players can complete a recipe from their hand, reveal an additional ingredient card.  If all players can complete a recipe, then the ingredient deck is adjusted again, and players discard additional recipe cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, if only some people can complete a recipe, those recipes are completed and given to a player who could not make one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after a number of rounds or when someone is too drunk - based upon the alcohol content of the drinks which have been placed in front of them.  The winner is the least drunk player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
