						               													<description>In General Palmer each player has their own slightly different board on which they build track and stations. This is done by means of action cards; players start with some in hand and draft a new one each round. Each player also plays a card each round which gives them an action and also permits a certain number of track tiles to be built. Actions can include buying trains and building stations of various types.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards to be drafted also determine a random event each round and a location on the boards for that event.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The right to draft first (and possibly choose the event location next round) is auctioned off.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After using their actions and building track players run their trains for revenue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when the deck runs out. Players then score for connecting Denver to Salt Lake City and also for eight out of the ten possible victory conditions; each player knows at least one of these, but some are hidden until the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the game was designed for up to five players, there are six boards and the rules do explain how to play with six if you really want to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
