						               													<description>From publisher's website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ultimate trading card game of strategy and skill.&amp;#10;Are you ready?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are battling against evil Pan, your power is down, out of nowhere your opponent strikes you with a Nymph!  But what he doesn't know, is never expecting, this is going to blow him away...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your hands tremble, can you pull this off... the most powerful card ever to cross a tournament table... YES!! you can do it!&amp;#10;The all powerful Zeus! the rarest card from the realm of the Gods!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is yours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Until next time...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;War Gods was to be a collectible card game featuring creatures and gods from myth and legend. The first release, the Titan Battle Set, would feature the Greek myths. The 130 card set (including holographic cards) would be available in 60-card starter decks and 11-card booster packs . The second release would have been the Wrath of the Gods expansion set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards were divided into three different levels: Level 1 was mere mortals, Level 2 was powerful creatures and heroes, and Level 3 was the realm of the gods. Defeating an opponent at each level would give a player access to the next level of characters and cards. Location and Action cards would supplement a player's battle tactics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A pre-release set of 104 cards was published and demo decks were shown at game stores. A two-day tournament was held in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The game was scheduled to be in stores by Summer 2001, then Summer 2002, then Winter 2003. The project was cancelled before its official release.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
