						               													<description>The Instructive Game of &amp;#10;MAGIC SPELLING&amp;#10;with&amp;#10;Bewitched Letters&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has 22 large cards with a picture of an animal, its name, and its point value.  It also has a large quantity of smaller letter cards, with which to spell the animals' names.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with one animal card face up, and the letter cards are dealt out equally to each player for their own face-down stack. Each player in turn reveals the top letter card of their stack and places it face up on the table. When someone sees that they can spell the name of an animal card on the table with the letters on the table, they call out that animal. They collect its card, and it's replaced with a new animal card. At the end of the game, the player with the most points in the animal cards they have collected wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
