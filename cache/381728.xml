						               													<description>Are you nostalgic for the days when romance meant making a mix-tape for someone? Feelings could be shown through only music and the decorations on a cassette tape.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Romance (&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#173;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#158;&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#179;&amp;#227;&amp;#130;&amp;#185;) is a reverse butting game. In most butting games, players try to avoid making choices that match those of other players, but in Romance, you try to match with exactly one other player. The game includes 56 cards with 8 different scenes or situations, and each card has a combination of scenes printed on both sides. The creates 28 possible combinations, and there are two of each combination in the deck. There are also cassette player cards where players will stack their scored cards. If you wish to play a 2-player game, the game includes rules for a dummy player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following the draw each turn, all players choose a card from their public hands and simultaneously play it. Any matching cards with the same situation showing are stacked together, and cards are drawn until there are as many situations on the table as there are players. Players then simultaneously select a situation. If exactly one player choose a situation, the card or cards go in their reserve. If three or more players have a matching choice, those cards remain in the play area. But if exactly two players choose a situation, they will score those cards. Once players have finished these steps, they may flip their entire public hand over so that the other side is now visible or return their hand to the deck and redraw.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players place any scored situation cards on the cassette player cards that include both of their player colors. They score any cards from the stack in the center of the table, any visible matching cards from the players' hands, up to one card with a hidden matching side from each player, and any matching cards from their reserve. Each card will be worth one point. Once any cassette player has 10 cards stacked on it or the draw deck runs out of cards, players will add up their points from all cassette players that match their color. The player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
