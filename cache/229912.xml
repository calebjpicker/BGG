						               													<description>An abstract skirmish level squad combat board &amp;amp; card game for 2 players, based on the X-Com video games. One player plays X-Com units, the other the Aliens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Use a large hex-map as the playing area. Every hex has 2 ratings: terrain and elevation.  These affect defence ratings and line of sight. Terrain is selected at the discretion of the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players use figures, miniatures or chits to represent units. Each unit represents a single soldier or alien. &amp;#10;-    X-Com units come in a variety of types: civilian, military, squaddie, specialist, officer, hero or SHIV robot.  Each has a hit value between 1 and 4, cost between 1 and 4, and can, through card play, undertake actions from one or more tables according to their type.&amp;#10;-    Alien units come in 15 different types.  Each has a hit value between 1 and 5, a cost between 1 and 5 and can, through card play, undertake actions from a table that is unique to their type&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common action deck.  Cards are of a number of type: Move, Attack, Defence or Special.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 3 Phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.   Tactical Phase&amp;#10;-    Draw 5 cards (or 4 if you only have 2 units left or 3 if you only have 1 unit left)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.   Move and Fire Phase&amp;#10;-    Your units may individually move and fire in either order as you decide.  All of your units get one free move of 1 hex. In addition to the free move, you can play one move card on one unit (per turn) to move it again a number of spaces as stated on the card.  Normally only one unit is allowed per space.  Exceptions include units being carried such as a soldier carrying a wounded comrade or a captured alien or flying units passing over or hovering over other units&amp;#10;-    Play an attack card to have a unit attack.  The attack card has a number which is the range of the attack.  All attacks do a base of 1 hit of damage. A unit reduced to 0 hits is killed. &amp;#10;-    Your opponent may play defence cards to negate damage.  A defence effect negates a base of 1 hit of damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3.   End Phase&amp;#10;-    Max hand size = 5 cards (4 if you only have 2 units, or 3 if you only have one unit left).  Discard excess cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner of the game is the first to achieve complete destruction of all opposing units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
