						               													<description>Rising Star Football Edition, the board game of dreams, where you have the chance to play out a footballer's career of your own. Compete against your opponents to earn points, money and fame all in the hope of having the greatest career and becoming Rising Star champion!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This sports based role-playing game allows individuals to play out a footballer's career. They compete in matches, have contracts and sponsorships, work with an agent and take part in different events.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Matches use the match dice to decide the scores and players roll against each other. Match Event cards can be used to impact the final score. Contracts allow the players to earn money and they can change contracts by being transferred or entering negotiations where their agent's ability (if they have one) comes into play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With varied tiles that require different actions and lots of cards to read aloud this game brings all the components of a footballer's life into a board game and gives a fun competitive environment for friends and families to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players roll the game dice to move around the board. Depending on where they land, different events occur. They could land on a variety of match event tiles where they have to play out a match against an opponent in the hope of defeating them and gaining points. They could appear in the press and draw a press card to read what the papers are saying about them, impacting their fame. They might enter contract negotiations and use their Agent's ability to enhance the amount of contracts they are offered. There are many different events that occur as the player goes through each season and this can change the storyline of that player as well as impact their career in positive and negative ways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The length of game varies depending on how many seasons players wish to play. This is decided at the start of the game and one trip around the board is equal to one season. The game ends when all players have completed the agreed upon number of seasons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout each player's career their goal is to collect Points (won by participating in Matchdays, Reserves, Derby Day and Cup Final events), earn money by improving their contract, gaining sponsorships and getting transferred and gain fame by appearing in the press. The referee keeps track of the scores and the winner is the player with the highest career score. The scoresheet has a simple formula for calculating the winner at the end of the game and the results are announced in reverse order crowning the winner Rising Star Champion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
