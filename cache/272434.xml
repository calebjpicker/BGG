						               													<description>In Softwar, players are electronics intelligence operators, or in common parlance cyberspies. Their job is to assemble, deploy and control teams of specialist digital programs into the world&amp;rsquo;s electronic networks. &amp;#10;Their aim is to access a set of key assets protected by their opponent, while simultaneously defending their own assets from enemy attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players choose and control a set of programs, each of which is represented by a dice. The value of any program is called its state.&amp;#10;A program&amp;rsquo;s state is reduced as it takes damage; if it ever lowers below 1, that program is immediately eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After setting up the board and assembling their teams, players take turns to run all of their programs. Programs come in two forms, Agents and Crypts. &amp;#10;Agents are active, movable pieces. Crypts on the other-hand are immobile; sat atop assets like protective turrets. Crypts are arguably more limited than agents, though unlike their mobile cousins, they also serve as an advanced asset deployment platform.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every agent may take a number of standard actions including moving, supporting (recharging their teammates) and attacking. In addition to these standard actions, each agent has a single specialised action, chosen by its owner before the start of the game. Players use these specialised actions to create advantages and opportunities to successfully win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player wins the game by either eliminating three out of four of their opponents Crypts (granting them access to the assets on which they sit) or by completely destroying their opponents team of agents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     35 dice per player in a variety of types (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 and D20)&amp;#10;     A batch crafted set of a board and tokens. &amp;#10;     A range of 15 special action cards per player, each of which may be applied to any dice type per player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the pulbisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
