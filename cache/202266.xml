				<name type="primary" sortindex="1" value="ZORP: Zombie Oblivion Response Pack" />
			
						                           
						               													<description>ZORP is a shoot-em-up strategy game that combines fast-paced action with chess-like strategic maneuvering and decision-making. It's easy to learn and has both recommended and randomized board arrangements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One player is a zombie master who controls a steadily growing horde of zombies. Every other player is a human who has been infected by the zombie virus. Humans have nine turns to get to a cure. Along the way they will gather weapons and events to help them survive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In a two/three player game, there is only one cure on the board and in a four player game there are two. This means that in a three/four person game, one human is always guaranteed to not get a cure. Humans will want to work together, at least somewhat in order to overcome the odds, but in the end, one person cannot be rescued, so humans may turn against each other to slow each other down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each human begins with one random weapon and their turns consist of two movement phases and an attack phase, which they can use in any order. (Move/Move/Attack, Attack/Move/Move, Move/Attack/Move) A movement is one tile in a non-diagonal direction and an attack lets you use all of the ammo at your disposal during the attack phase. Each weapon has different properties and the ammo is reloaded each turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a human lands on a weapon tile, they add it to their inventory and are able to duel wield weapons. If they land on an event, they trigger it immediately. Some events persist throughout the game (like finding fast shoes, etc.) some are one time use (like finding a live grenade, etc.).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Zombie Master's turn begins by moving all of the zombies on the board. Different zombie types have different movement abilities. After moving existing zombies, he/she spawns new zombies to add to the board. Certain turns will also trigger a zombie event after the new zombies have been placed on the board. Zombie events are generally good for the Zombie Master, but expert humans can find ways to exploit certain zombie events.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players take turns until either all the cures have been acquired, or time runs out and none of the turns have been acquired or if the zombie master can zombify all the humans in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
