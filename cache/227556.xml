						               													<description>The game begins with the dealer taking out one card from the entire deck for each person playing.  One of these must be the lone Johnny card.  These special cards are shuffled and placed on top of the remaining deck. All cards are then dealt to players, one by one, facedown into piles.  Although it is not known who has the Johnny card, it is known one of the player&amp;rsquo;s piles includes it at the bottom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Counters, either beans or buttons, are also passed out. Each player receives ten counters.  Approximately twenty-five counters are placed in the center of the table for all players to pay into, or take from; according to what their cards state.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking turns, players flip up the top card on their piles and place it in front of them. They read the card aloud for all to hear, and follow the instructions to &amp;lsquo;pay&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;take&amp;rsquo; counters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;he deck consists of one &amp;lsquo;Where is Johnny?&amp;rsquo; card.  When this card is turned over, the card is passed to each player for one round.  Whoever holds the card during the round is free from making any payments into the center.  He can receive, though.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the final Johnny card is flipped over by a player, the game ends.  Whoever has the most counters at this time wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
