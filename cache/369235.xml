						               													<description>A source book for Flames of War detailing the desert campaigns of North Africa for all combatants (British, America, German, and Italian).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It has been a while since we turned the spotlight on the war in the desert, but that is about to change with the release of the North Africa compilation and the accompanying starter and army sets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whether you are returning to the Mid-War period or starting from scratch, everything you need is now easily accessible in one place. The North Africa compilation includes all of the existing Mid-War books for the war in the desert:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Afrika Korps, 90th Light, and Death from Above for the Germans,&amp;#10;Armoured Fist and Red Devils for the British,&amp;#10;Avanti and more from Death from Above for the Italians, and&amp;#10;Fighting First and All American for the Americans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ve brought back many of the odd and unusual tanks from the Mid-War Monsters book from ten years ago.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The book really does have everything a beginner needs: history and background, interesting formations, organisational information for building a force, and game stats for playing the game. Each army has a painting and basing guide, along with a beautifully illustrated catalogue of the available models. It is a one-stop gaming resource for the fighting in the Western Desert leading to the decisive Battle of Alamein and the close-fought battles in Tunisia that finally sealed the fate of the Axis in North Africa.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each country has its own section, starting with a guide to some of the major battles they fought, their unique special rules, and the organisation of their forces. Each country has a selection of formations that you can field. These usually include light and medium tanks or self-propelled guns, and various types of infantry including armoured infantry in half-tracks for the Americans, paratroopers for each country, and rangers and commandos. This is followed by a selection of anti-tank guns, artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and aircraft to support your core formation. All-in-all, there are 33 different formations to choose from, or to mix and match to create your unique force.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
