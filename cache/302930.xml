						               													<description>You have invaded the convention hall in search of some great relic; but its pieces have been scattered throughout the event. Will you be the first to find the parts needed to claim the prize?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players build teams, either solo or collectively, of searchers, scouts, and fighters. Searchers investigate areas, the time it takes is based on that character's skills and the size and use of the room. Once found, your scouts run the relic piece back to base. But watch out for your opponent's fighters as they want to get it back.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The convention hall uses a modular system so you may decide on the size of the game. A more enormous building has more rooms, events, and hidden pieces, and will provide longer playing time. Costumes, food, boosts, and more come from cards that are found or purchased. Use dice for combat and searching revelations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When entering an area, flip the tile to show its layout. Is it filled with several vendor booths or one room dedicated to a celebrity speaker? Is it themed for anime or sci-fi? This all matters because you can dress your team members to get the help of the other con-goers in the room, and you definitely don't want to get caught wearing your StarFeet uniform in the Anime room.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Time and Turns&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game progresses using a virtual time system based on 5-minute increments and passing half-hours. Players take their characters through a half-hour at a time, completing as much as they can during their turn. Events may change from hour to hour, so teams need to be sure they are paying attention to the show schedule. A quick-moving scout may get from one corner of the conference to the opposite side in 15 minutes, or 3 turns, while a fighter wearing a giant robot armor suit may take an hour or 12 turns. Once in an area with a potential object, searchers use their observation skills to look for them. Someone more observant will use fewer turns to search the area. Two searchers on a team will do it faster, and an enemy in the room can distract the searcher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Classes&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Searchers find items based on a combination of factors: their statistics, environmental factors from the area card, time elapsed, and dice. Be sure to read the room because if your cosplay matches your environment, the others in the room will help your search, whereas you in a pirate outfit will surely be harassed by a room full of furries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scouts are used to transfer information, outfits, and relic pieces quickly. If a room changes from one theme to another during an investigation, a scout may need to purchase and run a new costume over. Once a relic piece is found, you may want to use your scout to get it back to your base as fast as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fighters are the brawn that are used to steal a relic piece from scouts or to help escort a weak scout back to base. They can also interrupt a searcher or keep an enemy from entering a room being examined.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Win&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winning team will have gathered all the relic pieces in their base before the event ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
