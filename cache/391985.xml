						               													<description>Look, this is a trick taking game featuring cards with numbers. There&amp;rsquo;s not really a lot of theme here. But you&amp;rsquo;ve got to admit the name is pretty fun to say. Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s get to the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Choose one suit per player, each suit has ranks 1 to 10. Put any remaining cards back in the box. Shuffle the deck together and deal 10 cards to each player. Set the 9 Anemone cards within reach. The player who is reading these rules is the start player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The start player plays one card face up in front of them. Every other player in clockwise order must play a card face up in front of themself in a suit that has not yet been played into the trick. If a player cannot play a suit that has not been played, they discard a card from their hand into their score pile. The highest card played wins the trick and takes all cards played into their score pile. The lowest card played takes an Anemone card, which can be added to a card in a future trick to increase its value by 1 (multiple Anemone cards may be added at once). If there is a tie for the highest or lowest value, the later played breaks the tie.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the hand, once all cards have been played, players score one point per card taken. The 3s, 5s, and 8s of each suit are worth an extra point. The player who has the lowest score at the end of the hand gains one +1 Anemone card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the highest score starts the next round. Play 4 rounds and the highest score wins! In case of a tie, the player with more Anemones remaining wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
