						               													<description>From Gamecrafters: &amp;quot;Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond is an easy to learn bluffing game for 2-4 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The year is 1926. The astounding Sphinx Diamond has been brought to London from Egypt. A glamorous masquerade party is being thrown to celebrate its unveiling. However, thieves lurk among the city&amp;rsquo;s rich and famous, each planning to steal the rare jewel. In Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond, players take on the role of a thief in disguise. They must guard their true identity while using poison to eliminate their competition.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;---&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Temptation of the Sphinx Diamond is a quick, fast-paced mystery card game in which players are attempting to be the last one standing without having other players uncover their secret identity. The game has two sets of characters: one set is masked, which are placed down in a row in the center of the table, the others are unmasked and one is secretly dealt to each player. Each player is now working to keep their character alive (no poison cards played on the character) until the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the character cards, there are poison and antidote cards and three (3) item cards that can be added for varying levels of difficulty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes two (2) actions on their turn:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Draw a card (poison or antidote)&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Play a card - play a poison on ANY character even if they are already poisoned. The poison remains on the character until any players play an antidote with the matching icon on a poisoned character to remove a poison. (Example: Snake antidote will remove a snake poison on a character.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Move an item - The items sit above the characters and can be moved to an adjacent character.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base game is played with just the Mirror in play. When the mirror is above a character, that character cannot have poisoned played on them. (Antidotes can be played.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When there is one (1) character that has no poison cards on them the game ends. The player who is that character will reveal themselves and they are the winner. However, if that character is NOT one of the player characters, the game resumes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Sphinx Diamond and Opera Glasses items can be added to the mix to up the difficulty of the game. They move in the same way as the mirror but have different effects. The Opera glasses item allows players to peek at each other's hand of cards. The Sphinx Diamond changes the win condition: In order to win, the player must be the last character with no poisons AND have the Sphinx Diamond above their character.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
