						               													<description>The Melbourne Cup Racing Game is simple spin and move horse race. Players select one of 5 plastic horses that have a base that is slotted into the board. The board is glued into the the game box base. It appears that the game play and layout is identical to that of the Whitman Kentucky Derby game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take it in turns to spin the Spinner which has 5 horses name. The horse name that comes up advances that horse one space down the slotted track. This is repeated until a horse crosses the finish post first and that player is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of historical interest is the plastic horse names which were Melbourne Cup winners between 1951 and 1955. The Melbourne Cup is the richest 2 mile horse race in the world, first held in 1861.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
