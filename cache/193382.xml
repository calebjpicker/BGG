						               													<description>Welcome to the colony of Dugbirch - not a sprawling city of splendor and spires and airships, but an almost forgotten place too far away from civilization and with not enough gold to attract the city dwellers.  But, just enough gold to battle over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two rival towns are mining gold and hiring the able bodied to build their towns into cities and their militias into capable armies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Iron &amp;amp; Brass (like its inspiration, the Warcraft PC games) challenges players to select the right strategy, then execute that strategy to defeat your opponent.  Hoard resources, build up defenses, build up an army, or some of each - all while your opponent is doing the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Iron &amp;amp; Brass is a Print and Play game played on a 10x10 to 16x16 square grid game board.  Each player has 14 structures and 24 military units available to build.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with a Headquarters, Barracks, 8 Gold, 1 Crew, and 8 &amp;quot;Advantage&amp;quot; tokens which can each be used as an Attack, Range, Movement, or Heal bonus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, a player may take up to 4 actions, any combination of: Mine Gold, Hire Crew, Move, Attack, Train Infantry, Build Structures or Vehicles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because of limited Gold in the game, players will need to decide how to balance gathering resources with building up defensive structures and building their army.  In addition, their army can be built quickly with Infantry units, or more slowly by first building structures such as Foundries, Arsenals, and Steam Works to build up armored units, artillery, and tanks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attacks are resolved by comparing Attack Strength + dice roll (+ Surge &amp;quot;Advantage&amp;quot; if played) to Defense Strength + dice roll (+ Surge &amp;quot;Advantage&amp;quot; if played).  Defending units may be destroyed, disabled, or sustain no damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player wins the game by destroying their opponent's Headquarters or all of their opponent's army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cover art was created by Todd Sanders, winning the cover art design contest for this game.  Some of the game piece art was created by BGG user &amp;quot;Skoll&amp;quot;.  He created images for: &amp;quot;Skirmisher Patrol&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Iron Infantry&amp;quot;, and because of those, really helped create the look and feel of the rest of the game piece images.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
