						               													<description>Ohana Proa models a gift economy in the Polynesian islands.  It is a game of route building, deliveries and gift giving.  The challenge of the game is. How to get ahead when the primary method of gaining points is by improving other player's positions?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;'Ohana Proa was developed publicly via a blog on BGDF.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Introduction&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The societies of the South Pacific were characterized by gift economies in which wealth and status were defined by what was given to others rather than personal accumulation. In Ohana Proa players will compete for prestige via gift-giving and thus improving the other player's positions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the course of the game players will explore and claim routes among the islands. The number of routes a player may explore and claim each turn is limited by the number of explorers the player has (maximum 2).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will also join markets among the islands by moving them along 'claimed routes and in doing so attempt to gather them into groups. A group of three, four or five markets (player choice) is &amp;quot;satisfied&amp;quot; and is removed from the game. The number of routes that a player may move a market over during a delivery is limited by the player's proas (boats, maximum 7).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By delivering markets through islands where they have network presence players will receive fish or shells. Fish and shells may be used to gain an additional explorer, to acquire more proas or kahunas, to bid for turn order, to claim explored routes and to make and enhance kula items. Kula items are gifts that may be given to other players in order to gain prestige (but give the recipient points).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fish rot quickly and are lost if not spent quickly enough. Shells rot more slowly and kula items decay. Kula items can be enhanced with fish or shells to increase their value when given.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when all of one colour of market has been delivered, a player reaches 33 prestige or the players reach deadlock. The player(s) with the lowest prestige score are eliminated from the game and do not score. The remaining players receive additional points for their prestige scores. The highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ohana Proa supports 3 through 5 players, is particularly recommended for 4 players and plays in around 150 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
