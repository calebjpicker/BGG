						               													<description>Test your culinary knowledge by guessing the right ingredient in a funny spicy card game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Relaxing game for all ages&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fast, Funny and even a little strategic&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Colorful, whimsical and you can bring it everywhere&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Separate the contingency deck from the main deck, consisting of recipes and ingredients, which will be called the &amp;quot;pantry&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;Shuffle the pantry deck and deal 4 cards face down to each player&amp;#10;You choose who starts, no matter how.&amp;#10;The starting player places a card face down from their hand in the middle of the table and loudly specifies which recipe it is.&amp;#10;The other players take turns, following the established order, play one of their cards from their hand, placing it face up in the middle of the table. Players must field an ingredient card that they believe is contained in the recipe in play.&amp;#10;Those who do not have the right ingredient or do not want to risk, can decide to fold, not playing any cards.&amp;#10;When each player has made their choice, the one who started turns their card face up, revealing it. Then he lists aloud the ingredients present in that specific recipe and at that point he takes all the cards in play, placing them next to him, in a dedicated pile.&amp;#10;The player (s) who have the wrong ingredient, playing a card that is not present in the specific recipe, draw 1 card from the pantry deck and 1 from the unexpected deck.&amp;#10;Finally, always following the order of the turns, the next player places his recipe card in the center of the table, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to run out of cards in hand and when only one is missing, shout &amp;quot;Spiked&amp;quot;, under penalty of having to draw 2 cards from the dispensation deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player whose turn it is to put his recipe card into play can decide to bluff, especially if he doesn't have one. The other players can accuse him of bluffing but before verifying it everyone must have completed their turn. Whoever has been caught bluffing will have to draw 2 cards from the dispensation deck and one from the unexpected deck; Who has guessed the bluff can discard a card from his hand; finally, in the event of a mistake on the part of the accused, he will be the one to draw a card from the dispensation deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Recipe cards have 3 precise and fundamental classifications: Origin, Flavor and Type of Cooking. Pay attention to these categories whenever you encounter Unexpected cards that can facilitate or compromise your final victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Provenance means the origin of the dish and you just need to know the state of origin, represented on the card by a flag.&amp;#10;     The Flavors are divided into Salty - Spicy - Sweet - Sour and Vegetarian&amp;#10;     Finally, the types of Preparation or Kitchen are divided into Pot - Pan - Oven or Fridge&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
