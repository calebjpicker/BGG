						               													<description>In 1793 a great calamity hit the world. The Rent in the Sky tore apart the heavens, destroying most of Italy and flooding Europe. Only one place survived mysteriously unscathed: Venice. In the years since, the Floating City has become a beacon of hope and trade, even as the Rent gazes balefully down, putting the city into a permanent twilight. The residents have changed and adapted to a new world, a world of magic and monsters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Creatures live deep in the canals, brought through the great tear in reality. These Rashaar are masked by the Church of Dagon, an openly benevolent sect whose home is in the flooded district of San Canciano, among the crumbling buildings and dirty canals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But there are others in the city that suspect more is afoot. The Guild -- a shadowy organisation of thieves and murderers -- orders the citizens around. The Guild protect them from evils of the city, but the cost is their loyalty and servitude. The King of Thieves has sent a small gang into San Canciano to discover its secrets, but once they do, the Rashaar will try as hard as they can to make sure no one makes it out alive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This box contains everything that two players will need to dip their toes into the foetid canals of Carnevale. Get ready to swim, row, climb, and jump your way across the city in a game that places movement at its core. Whether you're skulking the winding streets, assassinating foes from the rooftops, or drowning them under the water, Carnevale offers fully three-dimensional gameplay in a narrative skirmish game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contained within are 2 small gangs -- the Guild and the Rashaar. There is a full 48-page rulebook explaining the lore and rules of the game, as well as a campaign to play through. Everything in this set is designed to get you playing quickly: from the single-piece models, through to the push-together cardboard scenery, fold-out play mat, dice, and even quick reference cards for characters, rules, and two scenarios to help teach the basics of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     8 Resin Characters: Both the Guild and Rashaar have four characters unique to this box. From the Gondolier with her bladed oar to the tentacled mouth of the Lesser Rhyll, all are covered in beautiful detail, and are all single-piece so you can get gaming quickly.&amp;#10;     Cardboard Scenery: Terrain is important in Carnevale, so we're providing you with loads! 3 buildings, 7 obstacles, a bridge, and even a gondola! There's also a double-sided 2'x2' fold-out paper mat to set up your game easily.&amp;#10;     48-Page Rulebook, Dice, Range Ruler, &amp;amp; Quick Reference Cards: This gorgeously presented book has the full rules for the game, accompanied with stunning artwork and background for all factions. With all the gaming aids you need, you&amp;rsquo;ll be playing in no time!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
