						               													<description>Players build a football team one player at a time in Fu&amp;szlig;ball Poker, but they're never assured of getting the player they want since all of the other team owners are bidding at the same time as you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts the game with &amp;euro;100 million; someone shuffles the 48 player cards, then places them in a face-down pile. On a turn, the active player draws and reveals four cards, then places a bid face-down on the table; while the bid itself is secret, other players can see how many money cards you included in the bid. Each player in turn places a secret bid, then they reveal these bids. Whoever offers the most money takes the footballer of his choice and places it in an empty position in his team line-up on the game board, then the second-highest bidder does the same, and so on. If a player has no money, he takes the last card on offer. The active player position rotates to the left, then players each bid on and draft another card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to acquiring high-valued footballers, players are trying to fill their team with a proper line-up of players &amp;ndash; midfielders in the midfield, three defenders and a keeper in the back, and so on &amp;ndash; as they score bonus points when those sections have the properly positioned players in them. When a player drafts an &amp;quot;ersatz&amp;quot; (substitute) footballer, it can replace any footballer already in play and it counts as being in the proper position; the drawback is that an ersatz player is worth no points on its own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After twelve rounds of drafting, each player will have a full line-up and one player on the sidelines; this player can be substituted for any other footballer already on the team, even if the substitute is not labeled &amp;quot;ersatz&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then tally their player points and any bonus points for completing a section with the proper footballers. The player with the highest score wins, with ties being broken by the money still in hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
