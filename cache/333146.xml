						               													<description>From 1904 to 1905, Japan fought a war with the great power Russia. This was over 100 years ago.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Russo-Japanese Campaign&amp;quot; is a game based on the Russo-Japanese War. The player becomes the commander of the Japanese or Russian army and fights to lead the player's army to victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The most important point in this game is &amp;quot;supply&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The troops need supplies to fight and to recover from damage. However, the Japanese army is restricted to using ships to get supplies, so they have to fight and win against the Russian Navy. The Russians, on the other hand, relied on the single Siberian railroad, so their supplies were not plentiful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thus, the two armies will have to worry about how to use their limited supplies.&amp;#10;While the land battle part is simple, with repeated movement and combat, the aforementioned supply constraints force you to make decisions about where to focus your efforts. In addition, the Japanese forces must decide whether to aim for the early capture of Liaoyang and Mukden, or to prioritize the fall of Lushun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The naval battle part is directly related to the acquisition of supplies by the Japanese forces, and the response of the Japanese forces will also change depending on the operational policy of the Russian Navy. However, in any case, if the Russian Fleet in Lushun is not destroyed before the Baltic Fleet arrives, Japan will be in a tight spot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are also tactical cards that add variety to the game. Tactical cards give you additional supplies, or give you an advantage in battle. Depending on how you use these tactical cards, the battlefield can change dramatically.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory or defeat in the game is determined by the victory points (VP) earned by the Japanese army. You can earn victory points by capturing strategically important points such as Liaoyang and Mukden, but you will be penalized if your troops are damaged or if you fail to capture important points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Will you be able to lead your country to victory!?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
