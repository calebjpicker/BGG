						               													<description>From the &amp;quot;Pledge&amp;quot; link on the Decision Games Website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This mid-sized-monster game can be played as a two-player or three-player contest. It has three large-hex maps, with 560 half-inch counters, covering the ETO from D-Day to V-E Day at 20 miles per hex. The main fronts are covered, excluding only Scandinavia and Greece. Each game turn equals a third of a month. Units are divisions for the Western Allies and Germans, corps for the Soviets (but with a complete divisional artillery order of battle), and armies for the Yugoslav's and the various minor powers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The system is an operational (rather than strategic) derivation of the one used in &amp;quot;Beyond the Urals&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Operation Kremlin.&amp;quot; No unit will have more than one step. All entry data, notes about reinforcement or special status, etc., can be printed on their reverse sides. Stacking is eight units per hex, with both sides having the move/fight or fight/move sequence option, along with the possibility for limited use of fight/fight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The system will be simple, making for a game players can finish in one long weekend, but there will also be plenty of historic chrome, such as: V-weapons, the Warsaw Rebellion, liberation of the death camps, F&amp;uuml;hrer-Mandated Offensives, FLAK divisions, the Upper Silesian industrial region, German economic collapse, National Socialist ardor, proletarian heroism, heavy bombers, naval gun support, fortified lines, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play begins with the Western Allied player (or the &amp;quot;Grand Alliance&amp;quot; player in a two-player match) launching the D-Day landing. He'll be free to choose just about any coastal hex from northern Germany to the Spanish border as his landing site. Or he might choose to come ashore that first time on the Mediterranean coast of France, the far north of Italy, or even somewhere along the Yugoslavian coast. He'll also have a second invasion available for use later that summer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory is determined using a point system, primarily based on the German retention of cities according to a schedule derived from the historic Allied advance. There will be periodic victory checks to prevent the German player from adopting any kind of unhistorical strategy based on retreating into the Reich's heartland at the very start of play to try to form some kind of super defensive hedgehog. That ploy would have been impossible for the Germans to support economically in the real-world, and having to maintain a certain level of victory points in order to survive the period victory checks will work to the same effect in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The combat results table will be of the unit-elimination type, with results of &amp;quot;D-elim,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;D-back-2,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Exchange,&amp;quot; etc. Thus replacements will be plentiful and the action along the fronts fast and furious. Typical German infantry division will have attack and defense factors of 1-1, 1-2 or 2-3, while panzer divisions will weigh in as 3-2s and 4-3s. In comparison, US infantry divisions will be 3-4s, while that nation's armor divisions will be 4-3s and 5-3s.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A boxed game to be designed by Ty Bomba. Est. Retail: $60 (Est. Pledge: $45)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
