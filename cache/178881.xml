						               													<description>The objective of the game is simple:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Don't get killed by the chainsaw maniac&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Be the first to collect four keys, unlock the front door and leave the house.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have been invited to the Chainsaw Maniac's dinner party. Clearly poor judges of character, on arrival they have discovered that the chainsaw maniac intends to murder them and has quadruple locked the front door to ensure that they don't escape before he has a chance to do so. A player wins the game by either getting four keys and touching the front door, or by being the last player alive on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player moves around the board by rolling dice and moving as many squares in any direction accordingly (but having to move around holes).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the initial first 3 goes, the maniac is released and follows the nearest player to him (who is moved by a player rolling the dice to determine the amount of spaces he goes once each player has had their turn). Once the maniac touches a player, the player must roll a certain number or higher than that number to ensure that they have not been 'hit' by the maniac.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Keys are obtained by searching through furniture (a card is drawn from the deck each time someone looks through furniture). The card can also be one of a special move which they can use).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player wins once they collect 4 keys and then rush to the front door to unlock it and escape.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
