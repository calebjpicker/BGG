						               													<description>With over 54 comic book cards featuring all original artwork, 38 powers to gain &amp;amp; allowing up to 8 players, there is plenty of fun to be had in Palm City. The game manual also features a Palm City History section you can fill out that keeps track of the winners and their game stats. So family and friends can forever remember your victory... Hero or Villain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will roam the Palm City streets on this 8x8 grid gameboard, using powers they gain to complete city events. At the start of the game all players will be competing against one another as heroes. Frantically moving around the board trying to complete city events before other players beat them to it. Each of the 54 city events are original and will make this city feel alive. City events could be anything from saving a family in a burning home, stopping a meteor from crashing into Palm City, or helping the mayor's cat out of a tree. Each city event requires certain powers to complete though, so players will also be competing to obtain genetic mutations around the board that grant powers. Palm City is full of stuff happening where your help is always needed but you know what they say. Live long enough... and you'll find yourself the villain. At any point in the game, a player may attack another player. The moment a hero player causes damage to another hero player, they become a villain. There is no going back from this. At this point in the game, your only objective as a villain, is to eliminate all other players using the powers you've gained. Each power in the game has a unique ability and with 38 of them, make sure you build your character carefully. All of this happens within a player's turn and a turn consists of two phases.&amp;#10; Phase 1: Move&amp;#10;Phase 2: Complete Action&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions that can be completed include: Completing a city event, gaining a genetic mutation, trading &amp;amp; discarding genetic mutations, applying powers, or attacking another player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Win the game as a hero by completing city events found on comic book cards and getting your city respect to 100 before any other player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Win the game as a villain by using your powers to bring the health of other players to zero, destroying them all, and taking over Palm City.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a large game featuring a lot of content. At first it might feel overwhelming, but the manual should easily guide you through the process of learning how to setup &amp;amp; play. Once you learn, you'll never want to leave Palm City.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        GAME STORY&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You and your neighbors notice something break apart in the sky outside the city. All of you gather and travel to the wreckage. You discover a glowing purple material. Something never before seen. It calls to you. It calls to each of you. One by one you all touch it. Everyone feels different. Everyone feels powerful. You realize each time you touch it, your genetics are mutating.&amp;#10;You're becoming stronger. You all decide it's best to keep this wreckage site a secret. The only question though, is what you'll do with your new powers. Will you become palm city's greatest hero... or its most feared villain?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to Palm City.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
