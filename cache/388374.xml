						               													<description>Detective: Saints and Sinners is the newest expansion for Detective: City of Angels, which is an epic narrative-driven board game set in the dark and violent world of 1940's Los Angeles. Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD Homicide detectives that will do whatever it takes to solve the case, but one player will take on the role of The Chisel whose goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Detective: Saints and Sinners features three cases from experienced designers Alara Cameron, William Kenyon, and Logan Giannini. Vincent Dutrait returns to provide his gorgeous period-inspired artwork, but this time he is joined by Roland MacDonald and Magdalena P&amp;#197;&amp;#130;oszkiewicz, both proud to make their visual mark on the City of Angels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the box 3 additional cases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One last hit for the Hitman.&amp;#10;A familiar mob capo meets a gruesome end, but it will be up to you to determine if it was an accidental overdose or something more sinister.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cloak &amp;amp; Daggered.&amp;#10;Little surprise that when a cohort of spies and G-men bring their shadowy games to Los Angeles it results in blood on the streets,but you will quickly discover how difficult it is to solve a murder when no one is who they seem!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blast from the past.&amp;#10;A decorated police Captain is nearly obliterated in a suspicion explosion, but with a list of enemies as long as the L.A. River it will be nearly impossible to determine who pressed the button.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
