						               													<description>What is Fear of the Dark?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fear of the Dark is a solo horror skirmish wargame set in the worlds of madness created by H.P. Lovecraft.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solo as this game is designed to be played alone, just you trying to make your warband survive another day. Although it could be played with two or even three players in cooperative mode, that is, fighting together against the forces of darkness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not an usual wargame (competitive mode / player vs player) with some solo rules designed ad hoc, this is a solo game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Horror as the supernatural and the mystery will be the common thread of our scenarios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Our characters will have to face haunted houses, gangsters, supernatural beings drawn from the worst nightmares, groups of cultists who want to awake forgotten gods, mysterious murders, ancient curses, and dusty books that predict the end of the world as we know it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skirmish since the games will be played with just a few miniatures on a table with some scenery, although this game is not attached to any specific brand of miniatures and you can use any that you like. Forget about huge armies and lots and lots of miniatures on the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Another strong point of this game relies in its narrative aspect. The focus is on the story since the plot in each scenario will have a great narrative weight, not just fighting without any reason or random encounters of wandering monsters. The scenarios will have a story that conects everything, all the events that happen will have a reason, and even may never be known by the player until the scenario is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The background of this wargame is set in the worlds of madness created by H,P, Lovecraft, where a strange universe of gods and monsters underlies our reality, twisting our world upside down and throwing ourselves into a bottomless pit of madness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game you will play a group of characters during 1920-40 fighting supernatural beings and their acolytes who unconsciously try to wake up the long dormant evil, exploring ancient ruins, hiding from shadows that could devour you, and struggling to live another day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not going to be easy, but it&amp;acute;s going to be fun... that&amp;acute;s for sure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ruleset is a 130 pages book that includes rules, 4 scenarios, cards, tokens and everything necessary to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Apart from that two free scenarios have been added (making it 6 scenarios and more than 180 pages), and they are not going to be the last free scenarios...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
