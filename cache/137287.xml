						               													<description>A (semi-)cooperative, Winx Club themed racing game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The evil Trix witches are planning to attack the fairy boarding school Alfea to steal magic. But the Winx are on their way, trying to reach Alfea to defend it. Will you and the Winx be able to reach Alfea first and win the most magic chips?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aim of the game: Each turn, players try to move their pawn as far as possible on the course to Alfea. The sooner they reach Alfea, the more magic chips they win. After three rounds, if they have collected more magic chips than the Trix, they all win together and the player with the most magic chips is awarded for being the most courageous fairy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup: The 23 path tiles are laid out to create the course to Alfea. The Trix pawn is placed on the &amp;quot;red fountain&amp;quot; space. 3 magic chips are put on the Alfea space. Each player chooses a Winx pawn and puts it on the starting space. The 48 flight chips are shuffled and placed at the center of the table. Each player draws three flight chips and puts them down in front of him/herself, face down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: The game is played in three rounds. Each round consists of several phases.&amp;#10;First, each player choose one of their flight chips and puts them in their hand so that the other players can't see what colour it is. &amp;#10;Next, players simultaneously reveal their chosen flight chip.&amp;#10;All players that are the only one to have chosen a particular colour move forwards to the next tile of that colour. The starting place and the &amp;quot;red fountain&amp;quot; space are the only spaces that can take more than one pawn, otherwise occupied spaces are jumped over.&amp;#10;Players who have chosen the same colour are banned for this round, they stay were they are.&amp;#10;Used flight chips are removed from the game. When all flight chips have been resolved, each player draws a new chip so that they have three chips again.&amp;#10;Lastly, at the end of each turn the trix pawn is moved one space towards Alfea.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A round can end in one of two ways:&amp;#10;First, two player pawns have reached the Alfea finish space. The first player to reach Alfea receives two magic chips, the second one chip.&amp;#10;Second, the Trix pawn reaches Alfea. The round ends immediately. All chips remaining on the Alfea space go to the Trix.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then, the second round starts in the same way as the first. After three rounds, the chips won by the players and by the Trix are counted. If all players together have more chips than the Winx, they win the game together and the player with the most chips is considered the most courageous fairy. If the Trix have more magic chips, the players lose together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
