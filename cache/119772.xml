						               													<description>A cooperative deck building game of vigilante heroism.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You won't see Crime City on any map, but that's how people have come to know your hometown. Sadists, Anarchists, the Mafia, each carving out portions of the city they call their own. Hundreds of innocent bystanders caught up every day in their turf wars, or held under their oppressive thumbs. Precious few have the time, the money, the guts, or the wherewithal to do anything about it. You're one of those few... of course it means you'll have to give up that happy home life, or that cushy job. The newspaper paints vigilantism in a negative light - you'd be viewed by the community as a monster. But your city bleeds... the city bleeds and it calls your name. Will you answer?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You're a vigilante hero, one of the few in Crime City who have come together to put an end to the reign of terror the city's been trapped under. Banding together, you'll fight through a swath of henchmen in order to find and defeat one or more Arch Villains. But to get stronger as a hero, you'll have to neglect some parts of your Alter Ego life - your family, your job, or your community. Which aspect of your Alter Ego life will you neglect?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
