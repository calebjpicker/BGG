						               													<description>Humans have entered the Space Age! As the Commander General of your space fleet, you are in charge of finding and capturing new planets and moons. But, you must use all your powers to defeat the other Galaxy Raiders. Ready?  Time warp...activate!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Galaxy Raiders, players are in charge of finding and capturing new planets and moons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Place the hexagonal boards in the center. Each hexagonal board has one planet and 4 moons on it. Yhere are two numbers in each half of the planet and one number in every moon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All players start with a console mat and eight pegs of one colour. The card deck consists of number cards and power cards. The deck is shuffled and each player gets seven cards. There is a dice with 4 operations &amp;amp; 2 any operation symbols.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you roll the dice. Using the operation you roll and any two number cards you have, you must capture a number position on the board. Once your cards are played, they are discarded. Pick up an equal amount of cards from the deck. At all times each player must have seven cards with them. Rules for capturing a number position:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You must capture at least one moon to be able to enter that planet.&amp;#10;If you have captured all the moons, nobody else can enter that planet.&amp;#10;You can enter a planet only after all four moons have been captured - either by you or by others. &amp;#10;You need to capture both halves of the planet to win the planet.&amp;#10;Once you win a planet, give the pegs of that planet back to the respective players and take the planet's hexagonal board and keep it with you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The power cards allow you to either evict another player from the moon or planet position or replace them in that position. If you cannot perform an operation, but have a power card then you must play it. You cannot simply skip your turn. But, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a power card you still discard a card and pick one up from the deck, you then either use your new card or pass your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules of entry, are first, moon then planet and rules of eviction, are first, planet then moon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to capture two planets or with the highest points, wins the game. If all number positions are captured then there is a &amp;ldquo;stalemate&amp;rdquo;, then points are counted. the points system is:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;each moon equals 1 point&amp;#10;each half of a planet equals 2 points&amp;#10;total value of a planet equals 8 points&amp;#10;Player with the highest points wins!&amp;#10; Galaxy Raiders is a game of planning, strategy and negotiation. Challenge your friends and family to see who will emerge victorious in this engaging battle of wits. Enjoy with them as they set forth on a galactic conquest to capture planets and moons using your mathematical prowess. For parents with young kids, it's the perfect way to introduce them to an entire learning multiverse. See them transform into problem-solving geniuses right before your eyes! A true interstellar skirmish, perfect for all ages!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
