						               													<description>Nodes is a strategy game for two or four players. The game board is octagonal, and each space is the intersection of a horizontal, vertical, and two diagonal lines. There are thus eight lines emanating out from each space in the manner of a compass rose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two types of pieces: nodes and units. Nodes are akin to the king in Chess. They only can move one space, and a player wins when they surround their opponent's node. Units are akin to pawns in chess. They are the main troops in the game and form the basis of each player's strategy. Each player has one node and eight units throughout the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unlike chess, however, the placement of the nodes on the board also determines how the units can move. The lines that extend in eight directions from the space a node occupies are called &amp;quot;lines of communication.&amp;quot; If a unit is located along a line of communication the unit can move, whether it's the player's node or their opponent's. If the unit moves into a space that is also along the same line as a node, it can move again. But if a unit moves out of line or starts a turn out of line, it can't move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player's turn involves moving as many pieces as they want as many spaces as they want in order to defend their own node and attack their opponent's node. Every turn asks the players to make strategic decisions about when to attack, when to defend, and how to do both with only eight units. At the end of a player's turn, they move their node, and the other player makes their move. The game ends when one player is unable to move their node.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
