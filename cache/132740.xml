						               													<description>This expansion adds an Arcanist Minion to the Malifaux universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki site:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Hoarcats are the cute and cuddly kitties of Malifaux that will rip your throat out. One isn't much of a problem, but the more of them there are the more trouble you are in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Hoarcat Pride's mobility is nothing to write home about, but they aren't bad either. They have a walk on the low side of average at 4, but their charge is slightly higher than most minions at 7. Their Pass Through ability also helps them to get around models trying to block a charge lanes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What the Hoarcat pride lacks in Mobility it makes up for in Offense. They have an average Cb on their Claws, but their damage track is quite high for their Soulstone cost. Add to this their (+1) Melee Expert and they have a lot of opportunity to lay down the hurt. The one caveat is that their damage is based off of how many Wd they have left. So the more damage they take the less damage they can deal out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You'll also want to save your high crows so that you can get their Rip Throat trigger. This will give an extra boost to damage against defenders without Armor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The other Offensive ability they bring to the table is their Devour spell. This allows them to sacrifice a Ht 1 model. If you have more than one Hoarcat Pride within 3&amp;quot; you can benefit from their Voracious ability. This allows the them to double their Ca when casting Devour and allows them to cast it on Ht 2 models as well. Keep in mind though that the target of Devour has to be living, so this isn't going to work well against some crews.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Being a Beast, the Hoarcat Pride is going to get the most synergy out of working for Marcus. Pack Leader can help to get an alpha strike with the Hoarcat Pride's high damage. While Howl can boost the Hoarcat up to an impressive 8 Wp. Finally, Primal Flame can help to heal them up and keep their damage high.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Myranda has a few of synergies with the Hoarcat Pride. First off, like Marcus, Myranda can companion with other Beasts granting the potential for alpha strikes. Second, if she takes the form of the Hoarcat Pride with her Shapechange Spell it is enough to activate the original Hoarcat's Voracious ability. Thus giving the benefits of Voracious without have to actually hire two Prides. In the same vein Myranda can use her Animal Instincts Spell to cast Devour herself with her higher Ca. Finally, her Primal Flame Spell can help to give the Hoarcat Pride back those few Wds it needs in order to keep the damage high.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
