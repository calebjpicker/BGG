						               													<description>After Alfred and Guthrum had arranged a truce at Exeter and with Guthrum retreating back into Mercia (Vol. 2). Alfred must have assumed that the West Saxons could once again to look forward to a prolonged period of peace. But within five months Guthrum had reinforced his army and on the twelfth night, while the Saxons celebrated there holy period, Guthrum and his Viking Allies launched a surprise attack at Alfred's Royal estate at Cippanhamm. Through good intelligence, good fortitude and/or plain good luck Alfred was able to escape and with a handful of followers made his way to the marshes of the Somerset Levels.&amp;#10;It is here in the most inhospitable of conditions of sea-flooded swamp that Alfred, with a handful of followers, was to make a seemingly impregnable fortress at Althelney. It was from that King Alfred was to launch a guerilla campaign against his Viking tormentors. Within five months the King's forces defeated the Viking Army of Guthrum in a pitched battle at Ethandun.&amp;#10;Though Alfred entered the marsh with a small number of loyal followers we also know that he was not completely without allies. Odda Ealdorman of Devonshire was protecting Athelney by controlling the River Perret from Cynuit Hillfort, and was to do battle there with the legendary Ubbe Lothbrok (son of Ragnar) Alfred also had the support of Ealdorman of Somerset, Aethelnoth, who had also been fighting the Vikings from the Somerset levels. Aethelnoth's support was in no doubt instrumental in helping Alfred regroup and plan his campaign to reclaim Wessex.&amp;#10;Not all of Alfred's Earls were as loyal as Odda and Aethelnoth, and in this game the Saxons of Wiltshire are in a state of civil war with their warriors split between loyalty for their King and a Saxon controlled Wessex. It is there that the treacherous Ealdorman, Wulfhere, gained control and sided with the Viking invaders.&amp;#10;The Viking strength was in their professional and aggressive soldiery skills. Their weaknesses were often in the re-supply of fighting men and the fact the West Saxons were fighting for their home.&amp;#10;Kings are of great importance in this series of games. When they are leading the warriors in combat your moral and thereby fighting ability is increased, without them weakened. Of course the loss of a King in battle can also mean the loss of your cause. However, in this era risks must be taken to take and hold the crown.&amp;#10;Sharpen your sword and pick up your shield for the call has gone out, 'the King is on the march'&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
