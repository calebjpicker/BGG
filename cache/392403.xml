						               													<description>After miles of travel with no other noise around you but your own, you see for your own eyes what all the murmurs have been about&amp;mdash;the city of Ignis. You thought it would be bigger, based on all the whispered conversations you overheard, but you guess that means you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better chance of getting your story captured in the history books.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Everstone, you will take on the role of one of the first pathfinders to arrive on undeveloped land. Your goal is to be the most reputable of them all. Travel the area, Influence and Trade with other pioneers, Harvest the land, and Salvage and Repair the Relics that have been long forgotten to become one of the most influential members of Ignis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players in Everstone will take turns moving their action pawn to a new location on their player board to perform its action. As the game progresses and players have repaired and keep relics they find, the action sequences they perform will be a chain of actions. Game play continues with players taking turns until one player has gained ten victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
