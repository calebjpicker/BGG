						               													<description>From the Kickstarter Page&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Morphology Junior takes all the fun of the &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; game and adapts it to younger players (target age: 8+.) In order to move their frog-pieces from the &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; lilypad to the &amp;quot;Finish,&amp;quot; Morphologists must put on their creative thinking-caps to build words like &amp;quot;bike&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;snow&amp;quot; using the 35+ game pieces provided (see below for details). The game mixes some &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; Morphology rules like &amp;quot;Everybody Play&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pick 5&amp;quot; with some new adaptations, including &amp;quot;Morph&amp;quot; (where the Morphologist becomes a piece in the game) and &amp;quot;Ribbit, Ribbit&amp;quot; (where the Morphologist can make noises to help his/her teammates guess the right word).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Morphology Junior, players form into up to 4 teams.  Each team gets a delightful plastic team frog marker to mark their place along the lilypad themed game board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After deciding if the players will use the easy or hard sides of the clue cards (or perhaps kids use easy and adults use hard?) the first team to play chooses their first Morphologist who will create the word on the card from a collection of bits including colored cubes, a black string, glass baubles, wooden planks and little wooden 'people'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In basic play, the Morphologist is a puppeteer and cannot spell out words or symbols, make any sounds other than a small amount of grunting and encouraging for guess feedback, and cannot interact directly with the pieces.  The rulebook gives the example of 'toothbrush' and how the Morphologist can't pretend to brush their own teeth but they can brush the teeth of the little wooden figure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some of the lily pad spaces can change this though.  Everyone Plays allows both teams to guess what the current Morphologist is building.  Interception allows an opposing team to guess if the current team doesn't guess correctly by the time the timer runs down. Morph! allows the Morphologist to be a piece as well, so go ahead and brush YOUR teeth!  Pick 5 forces the Morphologist to choose just 5 props to use after looking at the word. Pick 5 + 1 however allows the opposing teams to choose the 5 props and the Morphologist gets to add just one more prop after reading the word.  And finally there is Ribbit! Ribbit! where the Morphologist can make noises!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Correct guesses allow a team to move their frog to the next lily pad.  First team to get their frog to the final lily pad wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
