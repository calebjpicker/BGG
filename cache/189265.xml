						               													<description>You've come to the arena stunning with its dominance over the city. There is no building, which would overshadow it. From the battlefield to the ceiling it is crowded with spectators dressed in the color of the programmer clans. The inner ring is simple. Floor filled with sand, the only apparent thing is the ellipse, which always turns on the power shield protecting the spectators. There are usually fighting two teams in such battlefield, at least one robot at each side led by a programmer. Will you become one of those famous programmers who shout commands to their robots and fight for the title? Build your deck so you can use your strategy toward winning in tournaments of RobotiCS.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;RobotiCS strategic deck-building card game offers to every player an opportunity to become a Programmer of majestic robots which are fighting with each other in a battle duels. Every player starts with the same starting deck and develops it and its strategy during the game (= deck-building system).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;RobotiCS card game is about strategic combat of &amp;alpha;-Robots supported by their Programmers. &amp;alpha;-Robots are loosing their hit and shield points, whilst Programmers are receiving exhaustion counters. During the game players are combining their powerful abilities. But &amp;alpha;-Robots can carry only one piece of each equipment, therefore players need to purchase &amp;beta;-Robots. The game can be influenced by Action and Reaction Program cards with immediate effects. There are being arisen many strategies during the games such as discard, healing, multiplication of &amp;beta;-Robots, agro, etc. 203 cards guarantee always countless different combinations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;RobotiCS card game is optimized for 2 players.
