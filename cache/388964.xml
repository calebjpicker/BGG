						               													<description>My 8 year old, Jasper, designed this dice game while we were traveling from home to Target. Happy to share it with you. It fits on a single card (rules included), so you can keep it with you wherever you go! You just need a bunch of dice, but I'm sure you (like us) carry dice everywhere you go anyway. Enjoy!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SETUP&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Place the card between yourself and your opponent. Each player receives 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12, and 1d20. Each player places their token on the START space facing them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Both players roll their corresponding die at the same time. For example: if a player's token is on the d8 space, they roll a d8.&amp;#10;     The player with the lower value moves their token closer to the edge of the cliff.&amp;#10;     If both values are a tie, nothing happens.&amp;#10;     CRITICAL HIT: If the value rolled by a player is the highest value possible for their die, their opponent moves their token closer to the edge of the cliff unless they are on the last space (d20).&amp;#10;     CRITICAL MISS: If the value rolled by a player is a 1, they move their own token closer to the edge of the cliff unless they are on the last space (d20).&amp;#10;     First player to reach the SKULL loses!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
