						               													<description>HIJACK is a card game about terrorists taking over a plane and trying to get away with it, with the most cash in hand, by the time the plane has landed, crashed, or exploded in mid-air.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is played without turns: as and when they choose, everyone just announces which card they're going to play, and on whom. An example exchange of cards might be:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ady reveals that he is the pilot, and tells the others not to kill him because he is the only person able to land the plane. (There is only one PILOT card in the deck.) But Beth has a PARACHUTE card, so doesn't care if the plane crashes; she plays a SHOOT card on Ady, who avoids that with a DODGE. Colin has the other PARACHUTE and also SHOOTs at Ady. Deb has a FLUKE card, so she could save Ady with that, but she also has a SURVIVOR card so expects to walk away from the inevitable plane crash, should the pilot die, so she withholds that for later. Beth reveals her PARACHUTE card and jumps out of the plane. But Colin then plays PROPELLOR, which makes a gruesome mess of Beth. He then jumps out of the plane as well, surviving the crash with a total of $7m in CASH cards. Deb is the last player on the plane, so plays her SURVIVOR card to walk away with $9m CASH and wins the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
