						               													<description>A &amp;quot;The Little Prince&amp;quot; themed game that helps children learn the clock.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Background story: On the Planet of Time the clocks are acting up. This is the evil snake's fault, because she has coaxed the time watchman into turning back the time. Who is going to help the Little Prince and his friends to scare away the snake and bring the hours of the day and night into the correct sequence?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup: The starting tile is placed in the middle of the table. The time rays are placed to its sides so that a long time ray from 0 to 24 hours is created (the time rays have numbers from 0-24 printed on them). The hour tiles (showing clocks) are shuffled together with the snake tiles and put face down on the table. Each player gets a character tile and places it in front of him/herself on the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aim of the game: To put as many hour tiles as possible in the correct position on the time ray and by doing so collect as many cogwheel chits as possible. Remembering where the evil snakes are hidden will help you to defeat them and win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: The start player puts his/her character tile in a position of the time ray that isn't yet taken up by an hour tile. Then he/she turns over one of the face-down tiles from the middle of the table. If it shows the same time as the position the player has put his/her character tile in (e.g. the character tile is on the &amp;quot;11&amp;quot; position of the time ray and the tile depicts a clock showing 11 o'clock), the hour tile is put in that position, the character tile is returned to the player, and he/she earns a cogwheel chit. If the hour tile doesn't match, the hour tile is returned to its old place in the middle of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a snake tile is turned over, the player has two options: First, he/she can simply return the snake tile face down to its old place. Second, he/she can return it face up and try to turn over the other two snake tiles. If he/she is successful, he/she immediately wins the game. If he/she isn't, he/she loses a cogwheel chit and then it's the next player's turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two ways the game can end:&amp;#10;a) The evil snake has been defeated (i.e. a player has turned over all three snake tiles). In this case there are two winners: The player who has turned over the snake tiles and the player who at this moment owns the most cogwheel chits.&amp;#10;b) All the hour tiles have been correctly placed on the time ray. The player who has collected the most cogwheel chits wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
