						               													<description>&amp;#229;&amp;#164;&amp;#169;&amp;#231;&amp;#149;&amp;#140;&amp;#227;&amp;#129;&amp;#152;&amp;#227;&amp;#130;&amp;#131;&amp;#227;&amp;#130;&amp;#147;&amp;#227;&amp;#129;&amp;#145;&amp;#227;&amp;#130;&amp;#147; (Heaven's Rock-Paper-Scissors) is a 2 player card game from Japan. The Archangels Lucifer and Michael are battling over the Earth. With each clash of their swords, a quarter of the Earth is destroyed. They draw on hunters and weapons to help them in their battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, players use a variety of action cards to strengthen their position, and then settle the round with a rock-paper-scissors (RSP) contest (known in Japan as Janken). The first player to win three rounds is the ruler of Earth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has a deck of cards, color-coded on the back so you know which is which; a support card (blue), a rock-paper-scissors card (yellow), or a weapon card (black). Players start a round with a hand of five cards. On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck, and may play one or two action cards, and then pass their turn. After both players have had a turn, if they both have a yellow card in hand, then a RSP test takes place. The players shuffle their hand cards and draw one at random. If this resolves a RSP, one player collects a scoring marker, and the cards are all reshuffled for a new round. If there is no RSP resolved, the start player marker switches to the other player and the game resumes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action cards give various benefits, such as drawing extra cards, or reclaiming a card from the discard and so on. Ultimately, a player is trying to determine which yellow cards their opponent holds, so that they might win the RSP contest. The game is more tactical than luck, and players are allowed to check the colours of the cards in the draw deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game also includes some extra cards that allow variants to be played, including an undersea city and demons and devils.&amp;#10;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
