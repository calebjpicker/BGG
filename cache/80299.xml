						               													<description>From the Developer:  Star Siege offers the player a friendly game of strategy that is easy to learn and fun to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The Zyntrac galaxy is the closest galaxy to the Black Hole.  Of the Zyntrac Galaxy, the four closest galactic sectors contain the most energy and power of any galactic sectors in the universe.  The very essence of this untapped power is reason inough for all Interstellar War Lords to battle for possession of them.  Players become Interstellar War Lords in Star Siege and use the forces of the Black Hole to gain strategic power over their oppenents, thus limiting their movements and eventually eliminating them from the game.  Enter the Star Siege and let yourself be cast into a galaxy where space and time do collide.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME is to conquer the universe by strategically occupying planets in such a manner as to limit your opponent's movements and eliminate them from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;EQUIPMENT includes a game board, one die, 16 men and 144 planetary chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Star Siege game board is separated into four galactic sectors:  Sector 1 is the closest sector to the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.  Sectors 2 and 3 are the second and third closest to the Black Hole and contain 12 planets each.  Sector 4 is the farthest from the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player receives 4 men of one colour and can use 1 to 4 men per game.  All players must use the same number of men.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player receives 36 planetary chips of one colour.  These are used to designate ownership of planets.  When players come to rest on a planet they place one of their planetary chips in the space provided and place their men on top.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY:  Roll of die determines order of play.  First player places one of him men and planetary chips on any unoccupied planet of his choice.  Play continues in a clockwise direction with each player doing the same until all planets are occupied.  Die is now re-rolled to determine who moves first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a players man comes to rest upon an opponents unprotected planet, he invades that planet and replaces the man and chip with his own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players try to enter the Black Hole by moving up along their own planets.  Upon entering the Black Hole the player can move his man to any unprotected planet on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player's man can only be eliminated from the game when it is &amp;quot;stranded&amp;quot;.  A player is said to be stranded when one of his men is surrounded by his opponent's planets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player is out of the game when all of his men have been eliminated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game comes with instructions for basic, intermediate, advanced and expert level play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
