						               													<description>Tres Reinos (&amp;quot;Three Kingdoms&amp;quot;) is a trick-taking game in which players often will have to team up with other players to reach victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each round, starting with the opening player, each player will first play one of their cards and then decide whether or not to draw a mercenary card to join their force. When everyone has done so, check to see which faction has the most power, as in this trick-taking game it is not the highest card that wins, but the faction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once checked, whoever has the most powerfull within that faction will first choose one of the two rewards available during this round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game the points are counted taking into account the conquered kingdom cards with their modifiers, the personal kingdom card with its own bonuses and penalties. The winner is the one with the most points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tres Reinos is a trick-taking game, in which players will have to know when to be opportunistic and when it is not in their interest to win a trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
