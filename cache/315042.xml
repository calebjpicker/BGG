						               													<description>Shattered Lance is a deck-building game with worker placement elements based on medieval jousting tournaments. Knights face-off against each other over the course of a seven day tournament with each round consisting of a Court Phase and Joust Phase. At the end of the seven days, the knight with the most victory points is named King's Champion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Knights participate in one-on-one matches and gain reputation and gold for their victories. Between matches they visit the Court to gain new items or mounts, gain favors from nobles such as the King and Queen, mingle with nobles to increase their reputation, or gain additional training for their knight and squires.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the Court Phase players place their knights and squires within the Royal Court. Squires spend gold to purchase items for their knights while the knights use their reputation to gain them. Players can build their decks at the &amp;quot;Training Grounds&amp;quot; to be used in the Joust phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the Joust Phase players will compete against their opponent using their decks. Items gained or purchased in the Court Phase can be used during the joust to aid the knights. There are four passes within each joust. During a pass each player strategically plays three different cards from their hand consisting of the &amp;quot;Herald&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;Shield&amp;quot;, and the &amp;quot;Levee&amp;quot;. Knights start with 10 stamina which they spend to play cards from their hand and lose it when they are hit by their opponent's &amp;quot;Levee&amp;quot;. If a knight's stamina reaches 0, they are unhorsed and can decide to remount if they still have a chance at victory. The first knight to score 10 points by the end of the fourth pass gains a victory token, gold, and reputation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the seventh day, players combine their victory point total based on their cards, victory tokens, and reputation points. The player with the most points wins the tournament!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
