						               													<description>This is a game that's somewhat of a fusion between Axis and Allies and Risk, finding a relatively simple-to-play compromise.  It plays across a game map that is territory-intensive in Europe and East Asia, with Africa and North America trailing along as close seconds.  The setup is abstractly accurate to the situations of the five powers (Nazi Germany, Empire of Japan, British Commonwealth, Soviet Union, and the United States) around the end of 1939 (with a few liberties taken in South America), and features neutral nations (That Japan, Germany, and Russia can attack), vassal-like allied nations (especially prevalent with Britain and Germany), capitol cities, key cities, research facilities, tanks, bombers, oil, and unique special abilities for each nation.  The objectives encourage playing across the entire map, instead of just Europe, and in fact might be more advantageous to do so.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Summary of National Situations:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) Nazi Germany: Having taken Czechoslovakia, Austria, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Poland, and France; and supported by its allies in Vichy France, Italy, Romania, and Hungary; the Nazi-aligned forces are poised to strike at Greece, Britain, and the Soviet Union (though the latter two are incredibly tough battles).  It has been recently brought to the attention of high command that the British-aligned forces have been building in North Africa, however, and Hitler has ordered Rommel there to advance the African front and take Libya and Egypt.  (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) Empire of Japan: Having annexed Taiwan and Korea, set up its puppet government in Manchukuo, and advanced down through Northern China, the Japanese Empire suddenly finds itself cut off from trade with the United States, a prime source of its oil.  The Japanese do have some reserve oil remaining, however, and if used sparingly, might be able to last until the Empire can secure its own sources.  There is much debate on whether Japan should declare war on America, and there is much incentive to do so, but there are some who believe that focusing on conquering China and British-dominated Southeast Asia might be a better strategy in the long run, and others still who believe the Soviet Union is an easier target. (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3) The British Commonwealth: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom and its colonies have all declared war on Nazi Germany.  Commonwealth and British troops alike have poured into the battlefields of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as moved in support of British-dominated Southeast Asia and India.  The British Commonwealth also keeps a wary eye across the Pacific to the expanding Japanese Empire, hoping that their Chinese allies can hold off the insatiable Asian power long enough for the Commonwealth to get its bearings.  Sir Winston Churchill meanwhile petitions the United States to join them...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4) The Soviet Union: Having seen the rapid expansion and great success of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union now seeks to expand its own borders.  The obvious choice is Finland, but Persia and Turkey to the south also seem inviting.  The success or failure of the Soviet Union rests on its ability to conquer and annex territory in much the same manner as Germany, and thus be able to display a strong showing against the remaining great powers of the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5) United States: Haunted by the spectre of the first Great War and rifled with its own domestic problems in the Great Depression, the American people want to stay out of the European War altogether, despite having become the protectors of Iceland.  President Roosevelt sees the danger of a Nazi-controlled Europe, but is having a difficult time convincing Congress of his views.  Although America could possibly get involved in the war on its own, it seems likely that the only thing that could draw the Americans is a direct attack against the United States.  However, there is a more definitive resolve to intervene if the war comes to the Americas... (Note: in a 3 or 4 player game, America is controlled by the British player, who keeps attempting to rouse the sleeping great power against Germany and Japan)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
