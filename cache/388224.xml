						               													<description>Prepare for a gaming experience like no other with 490 Cards! Combining dice, cards, and coins, this innovative game challenges players to forgive their debts and drive them down to zero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this exciting world, each player starts with 490 debts-to-forgive (&amp;quot;D2F&amp;quot;). The objective? Be the first to reduce your debts to zero and claim victory. Utilize dice rolls, multiplication factors, and strategic decisions to decrease your D2F or increase your opponents'. To simplify calculations, we've designed the 490 Cards&amp;reg; Scoreboard, a free app available this fall on your favorite app store.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The comprehensive 490 Cards Starter Kit provides everything you need to dive into the game. With 252 cards, including Inventory cards, Doubters and Disciples Domain (D3) cards, Grace cards, Grudge cards, and more, the kit ensures a varied and immersive gameplay experience. Eight dice of different types, including the custom 12-sided block dice, add further depth to your strategies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But that's not all! The Starter Kit also includes 12 Compel Coins, allowing you to influence other players' actions and introducing additional layers of strategy. With the Simple Start Card, Comprehensive Rules Booklet, Scorepad, and Rigid and Tuck Boxes included, you'll have everything you need to enhance your game night.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, 490 Cards is not just a standalone game. It's a TCG/CCG with a booster box containing 36 packs of 12 cards. Collectors can amass the full 490 cards associated with the Alpha Instantiation release. The Full Series I boasts an impressive 1200 cards, with subsequent releases, Beta Invasion and Gamma Illumination, expanding the possibilities and rounding out Series I.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;490 Cards. It's All About Forgiveness... No Trivia. The Possibilities are Endless. &amp;amp; There's a card for that...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
