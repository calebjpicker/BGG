						               													<description>Sheeplike is a Theocratic Card Game for family worship based upon going out in the ministry and finding Sheeplike ones and starting bible studies while avoiding Do Not Calls. 2-4 players ages 9+ can play in 30-60 min using tools like the bible, pioneers, Jesus and even Jehovah to win the householders hearts over.  The goal is the first player to 4 bible studies. You gain a bible study by finding the Sheeplike one out in the territory or be the last player still in the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup:  The territory consists of 9 cards (houses) grouped in 3 piles hiding where the Sheeplike and Do Not Call cards are.   Shuffle the Sheeplike, Do Not Call and 1 Not Interested cards and create 3 piles.  Then deal 2 more territory cards on top of the 3 piles.  Players are each dealt 1 card each from the publisher cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of 2 stages:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Door To Door: Players draw and play cards searching through the territory stacks for the Sheeplike one. There are 17 publisher cards that allow players to flip the cards in the territory and move cards around within the stacks. This allows for players to hide traps and uncover the Sheeplike card. If a Do Not Call is flipped without the protection of the Bible card, that player has to sit out of the current round. If the Sheeplike one is not found by the time that there is no more publisher cards to draw from then the next stage starts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Return Visit: Once all cards have been drawn from the publisher draw pile. All players turns over their one card in their hand.  Whoever has the highest value card, they get the first pick of where they think the Sheeplike card is at. Remember the players have had a few turns to deduce the most likely location of the Sheeplike one. So when the publisher pile is getting low, it is good to hold onto higher value cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
