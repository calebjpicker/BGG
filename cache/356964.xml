						               													<description>The Mysterious Tower of Magic was left without a master. Now the wizards of the Great Five will have to choose a new master.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Shaman of the North, the Witch of the East, the Sorcerer of the South, the Seer of the West and the Sorcerer of Outland will leave their regalia and books, amulets and artifacts in the main hall of the Tower. They will go to meet the trials, armed only with their talents, will, knowledge, and with the help of faithful familiars - magical animals. Descending into the dungeons of the tower, players find themselves in the very center of the labyrinth. All possible routes diverge from it, and the most distant rooms contain spell scrolls, only all passages are protected by magical seals of the four elements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The search takes place in rounds, at the beginning of each of which the players, in turn, take three different-colored dice from the general supply and roll them. Sinces the mage can easily move from one point of the dungeons to another, if there is no obstacle in his way, it is very important not to give rivals a chance to steal the scroll from under your nose. To do this, you need to skillfully occupy strategically important passages with the chips of your mage and familiar. The collected scrolls not only bring victory points, but also allow you to manipulate dice, seal tokens lying on the playing field, and even the enemy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game end when a rounds ends with the number of scrolls with a strength of 6 is checked (at least 3 for 2-3 players or at least 4 for 4-5 players).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner is the player with the most victory points (the sum of all his scrolls and bonus points for spells).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There was room for five circles of magic in the box, and only two of them (one basic and one additional set of scrolls) are used in each batch. Each circle of magic has its own specialization, so their choice affects the nature of what is happening in the dungeons of the tower. This allows you to diversify the game and provides high replayability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
