						               													<description>Decampment is a free roam survival board game in which you and up to three other players battle the Esoteric Order of Dagon and each other while collecting four keys in order to escape from the town of Innsmouth. Decampment is the first game to be released by F Squared Game, an upcoming tabletop game company created by two friends who were inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft and want to keep the competitive spirit alive between family and friends. F Squared games has been working on Decampment for a little over a year before launching. Enlisting the help of family, friends, and fellow board game enthusiast for countless hours of play testing to ensure it is an enjoyable, simple and affordable game for everyone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Decampment is a very simple game, unlike most other RPG style games. It is very easy to understand and anyone is able to play. Most aspects of the game are determined by the roll of only one die. We wanted to keep this game simple because we find it harder to enjoy, let alone finish, the more complex games and tired of reading large rulebooks before even attempting to play the game.&amp;#10;Here is a brief overview of the main parts of the game. &amp;#10;-Movement around the Board: Roll a die and you're on your way, you are able to move any one of the four directions throughout your move as long as you don't touch the same space twice in one move.&amp;#10;-Battling with Hood Cards: Hood Cards have an attack and defense number listed right on the card. To win the battle, you simply have to roll one die a higher number that the card's listed defense number. If you fail to do so, the attack number on the card comes into play. The difference of your roll and the attack number is the amount of life points you lose.&amp;#10;-Dueling with other players: Very similar to facing the hood cards, but both players have one die and roll against each other. The difference in the rolls is the amount of life points the defeated player loses.&amp;#10;-Weapon Cards: Weapons are very helpful and are taken from hood cards if you successfully defeat them. They modify your attack rolls by adding the fixed number listed on the weapon card and work against hood cards as well as dueling with other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
