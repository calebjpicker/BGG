						               													<description>Where's Tinker Bell is not a traditional board game in many ways, although there are certain elements like turn taking which are the same. The game comprises of a revolving green plastic base which looks a little bit like a small green hill. On the top of the hill you place a small plastic model of Peter Pan. He doesn't serve any purpose in the game at all, but the girls quite like him! There are eight plastic bluebell cups which are placed over eight holes on the revolving board. Under one of these is placed a small Tinker Bell fairy and the aim of the game is to discover exactly where she is! You might think this all depends on guess work but it does not because Tinker Bell makes a 'tinkle bell' sound when she moves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So how does the game work? After you have put all the above pieces in place, each player then receive a number of playing cards. These have pictures of Peter Pan, Wendy, John and Michael, and depending which cards you have determines whether you can spin the revolving board or not! It does not tell you who should go first in the instructions but we normally say it is the youngest player. So if that player has the appropriate card, they can trade it in for a spin of the board. And this is what happens...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Firstly they have to be quite careful because if the board is spun too heavily all the bluebells will go flying. If you spin it too gently Tinker Bell will not make a sound. Therefore, the key to success in this game is getting your spin just right! If you do, the board should spin round and you should hear some tinkling music which hopefully should lead you to working out which bluebell Tinker Bell is hiding under! Now this is actually easier said than done! As an adult with probably better levels of concentration than my daughters, I find it quite difficult. You really need to have total quiet and place your ear as close to the board as you can! Then it is possible to get a good idea where she is although I still think it comes doen to a certain amount of luck!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
