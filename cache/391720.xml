						               													<description>Originally published in 2009 and designed by Hisashi Hayashi (Yokohama, Trains, Metro X), String Railway is a 20-minute, 2-5 player game in which players create their own map directly onto the table, complete with borders, mountains and rivers, then build atop it a network of railways, all made out of string.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following in 2011, the sequel String Railway: Transport (now renamed String Railway: Cubed) combined the premise of Sting Railway with the weighty decision-making of games like Railways of the World, producing a mid-weight 45-minute game. In the game, players start with a map of stations already built and must balance the desire to upgrade their engines, and fulfill bespoke delivery contracts, with the need to quickly build a flexible train network that can transport goods to a range of destinations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The String Railway Collection packs both of these standalone games into a single small-box package and features vibrant updated artwork, improved graphic design, and a refined ruleset.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
