						               													<description>The Democratic Republic of Korruptonia is in turmoil after the last president was suddenly removed from office (once again). The result of this was a dangerous instability, which swept the influence of the main parties in all regions of Korrupt&amp;ocirc;nia, creating a fertile environment for a non-partisan outlet of the whole country. So to conserve the stewardsh... or rather, the Korruptonian democracy, the country's main political parties articulate an emergency electoral campaign in order to regain partisan prestige and elect a representative.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to be able to elect its representative, the party must increase its influence in the regions of the country, through the presence of its candidate or the support of the media, personalities, smaller parties and companies. With the use of mechanics like area control, auction and hand and resource management, Korrupt&amp;ocirc;nia is a strategic game of fantasy themed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are five regions of Korrupt&amp;ocirc;nia, and each one has different demographic characteristics in each game. All these regions begin with a high influence of the partisans and with almost no influence of the great political parties - each party only initiates with a minor influence in its original region. Each player will have five weeks (or five rounds) to reverse this scenario, gaining enough influence for his candidate to lead the polls at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To achieve this, players will have to manage well each of the phases of the rounds: the campaign phase and the political action phase. In each round, the position of the candidates in the polls will determine the order of the players, in descending order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the campaign stage, players must decide whether to move their candidate and pay the costs (of money and speech, which are two of the three resources that the parties must administer) to campaign wherever they are, gaining influence in doing so .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After that, in the political actions phase, each player must take one of the actions of the cards in his hand, eventually having to pay his costs (of money, speech and government positions, which are the three features of the game). These actions range from setting up campaign committees, influencing news media for or against candidates, and also hiring famous people for your campaign, joining smaller parties and attracting companies to fund the campaign (these last three actions require a auction with the other parties). After making an action, the player can exchange resources with the political market, which varies with each negotiation, and also use one of the political actions of the open cards on the table, paying extra costs for this. At the end of each round, the party influence in each region determines an update of the voting intentions of the candidates in the polls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of five weeks, the party ahead in the polls will win the match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
