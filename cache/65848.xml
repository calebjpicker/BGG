						               													<description>Players play from a hand of cards which have creatures with attributes that are based on the properties of the elements on the periodic table. Each player is trying to collect the largest army, there is no actual fighting in the base game but this is planed for adding into future expansions.&amp;#10;The top card of the draw pile is turned over, and each player tried to win that card to their army by playing a card from their hand that can match to that card and also using their standard multiplier cards that they can keep and reuse in the game. The winning player, which is determined by the actually chemical reactivity printed on the card, adds wining pair of cards to his army, and the loser takes the card they played back into their hand. The winner then draws back their hand to starting number and reveals the next card off the draw deck to win.&amp;#10;When the entire draw deck is emptied players can attempt to combine cards from their had and if that is possible can then add them to their army. The winner is the player with the largest army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the publisher's website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ELEMENTAURS were originally created as nanorobots but through a fortuitous accident in a bioreactor these synthesised beings took on a life of their own. They are living beings who have much to offer the human race. They can teach us many things, give us gifts, help us solve problems and defeat our enemies. Neither good nor bad, tame nor wild, they take on some of the personality of the human who releases them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ELEMENTAURS BOOT CAMP is an exciting new card game with adventures on a subatomic level. In this game you meet the first eighteen of the ELEMENTAURS. You learn which clans they belong to, how they might behave and, most importantly, how to recruit them to your team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ELEMENTAURS BOOT CAMP may be played at many different levels, depending on the age and ability of the players. From the simplest games through to the challenging COMBAT COMBOS there is something for everyone. And after the games are played, just looking at the cards is an enlightening experience. There is much to be learned and laughed about in the images and text on each of the cards as you decide which is your favourite ELEMENTAUR.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This starter deck is just the beginning as there are 92 ELEMENTAUR creatures to meet. Soon the next series of 18 will be released along with enemy, challenge and rare cards in packs of 10. There is also a series of books that will be published telling about the creation of the ELEMENTAURS and the adventures of a group of children in their quest to release them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
