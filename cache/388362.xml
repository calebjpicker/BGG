						               													<description>Les (from Middle English: -les, meaning &amp;quot;without, empty&amp;quot;) is an abstract board game for two players who play on an initially empty hexagonal board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Objective:&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to dig the most number of large holes on the board, that is, to surround empty intersections with your stones separately.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; A hexagonal board with 9 intersections per side (but can be played on smaller boards for shorter games).&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; One set of black stones and one set of white stones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Definitions:&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; A hole is a set of empty intersections completely surrounded by stones of one color, when you're surrounding empty intersections with stones it's said that you are digging a hole.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turns:&amp;#10;Black plays first, then alternates. On your turn, you perform these actions in the following order:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Place a stone of your color on an empty intersection adjacent to friendly and enemy stones simultaneously.&amp;#10;2. Place a stone of your color on an empty intersection not adjacent to any stone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When neither player can take the second action because the board is filling up, both players take only the first action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of the game:&amp;#10;The game ends when a player runs out of moves, the player winning under the following conditions in order of importance:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. The player with the most holes made up of stones of their assigned color wins.&amp;#10;2. In case of a tie, the player with the largest hole (ie containing the most empty intersections) wins, the next largest holes being used for the tiebreaker.&amp;#10;3. In case of a tie in the size of the holes, the player whose largest hole contains the most stones connected to him wins, the next larger holes with the most stones connected to him are used for the tiebreaker.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If neither player managed to form a hole, it is a tie (it is very unlikely that any player will form at least one).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To keep the game fair, before play begins, the first player sets four starting stones, one black adjacent to a white, and one black one intersection away from a white. The second player chooses the sides.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
