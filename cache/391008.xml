						               													<description>Toss the dwarf chip, harvest mushrooms, and build buildings to earn points. Players can build depending on colour and number of mushrooms. So watch the building cards on the field and the forest conditions for mushrooms to be harvested. The player who has the highest total of 10 points on his or her building cards wins the game. However, beware of poisonous mushrooms, which give players negative points when harvested.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
