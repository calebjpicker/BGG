						               													<description>From the rules: &amp;quot;The object of the game is not only to afford amusement to the players but also to illustrate to them how proposed Share-the-Wealth Plans, Excessive Old Age Pension Plans, etc., will increase taxes and place a heavy burden on all citizens and, at the same time, make it possible for the shrewd manipulators to gain a dominating position in economical affairs of the country.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the outset, let it be understood that before the Government can bring about a share-the-wealth program it must own all properties and all monies. Under a share-the-wealth scheme it is proposed that the Government shall make every man a king and give each person an equal share of the money, after which time each must take care of himself. If a man has good luck and is a shrewd manager, he may beat the game of &amp;quot;inflation.&amp;quot; If he isn't, he will be no better off than theretofore and distribution of the wealth of the country will not have availed him anything&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is played like modern Monopoly. From Wikipedia: &amp;quot;Inflation board game came to the attention of Parker Brothers management in the 1930s, after they began sales of Monopoly. Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than going to trial, since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played Monopoly before Darrow's &amp;quot;invention&amp;quot; of the game. The court settlement allowed Copeland to license Parker Brothers' patents&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
