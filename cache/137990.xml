						               													<description>How to play&amp;#10;Begin the game by having every player roll a die to see who goes first. The person who rolls highest goes first, followed by the person to their left and so on and so forth. Should two or more people roll the highest number than they must roll off until someone has rolled higher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When it is your turn you must do the following.&amp;#10;1.    Draw a card from the draw pile.&amp;#10;2.    Use a power card, place a character card in play, or use a character card power.&amp;#10;3.    Discard cards from your hand until you have only five left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Power Cards&amp;#10;Most power cards may only be used on your turn. When you play a power card you immediately do whatever it says, then discard it. Well&amp;hellip; not immediately, but before you do anything else game related. So you could eat a sandwich or something.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some power cards may be used at other times, which is indicated on the card itself. When in doubt, the card is right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Character Cards&amp;#10;Character cards may be placed in front of you during your turn instead of using a power card or a character power. Place the character card in front of you and leave it there until something tells you to place it someplace else. This is now considered to be an &amp;ldquo;in play&amp;rdquo; character card. You may not use the Character Card Power the turn you place a character card in play. You may only have three character cards in play at a time. If you place a fourth you must discard one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Character Card Powers&amp;#10;Instead of placing a character card or using a power card you may use the power on one of your &amp;ldquo;in play&amp;rdquo; character cards. This power works just like a power card, except you do not need to discard the character card to use it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note, some character cards have passive effects that do not require you to use them on your turn. These abilities are always in effect and should be easy to determine. If an argument does ensue the following characters have &amp;ldquo;passive&amp;rdquo; abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Khan-El, Biel-Tel, Beorn, Penelope, Neil and Harris.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Win&amp;#10;This is the part you have all been waiting for isn&amp;rsquo;t it? To win the game all you have to do is have all of your in play character cards be the same characters as on your Dream Team card. Once you do that you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
