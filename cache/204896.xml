						               													<description>This turn of the 20th century educational game has a deck of 48 cards. Each card has between one and four geographical features listed, including continents, countries, rivers, mountains, and cities. Under each feature name is a list of questions to which that feature is the answer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards are dealt out evenly among the players. The first player chooses a question on one of his cards and asks the player to his left for an answer. If the player cannot answer, he gives up a card to the questioner, who sets it aside. The questioner then moves to the next player with the same or a different question with the same answer and continues until someone answers correctly. If no one answers, the questioner sets it aside for himself and chooses a new card. When a question is answered correctly, the questioner surrenders a card to the answerer and the questioner's turn ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All cards won are set aside and out of the game. When all of the cards have been claimed, the player with the most cards wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alex G. Malloy in American Games: Comprehensive Collector's Guid (1999) dates this game as circa 1890s, but the deck includes two cards with questions about the &amp;quot;murderous revolt against Christian civilization&amp;quot; and the capture of Pekin by &amp;quot;American and allied troops&amp;quot;, both in 1900. Another card refers to Cuba as a country rather than a Spanish colony, and the game includes an ad for the &amp;quot;fine new games&amp;quot; of The Comical Game of Who (1899) and Sir Hinkle Funnyduster (1903), with the latter providing the likely publication date of this game as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
