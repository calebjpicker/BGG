						               													<description>So you are looking for a new type of card game. Maybe you want a to give a great gift, or the kids are way too active and you want to give them something new to do. Maybe you are a student, or a teacher or maybe you just enjoy most everything about the Martial Arts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Well...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to Martial World's advanced &amp;quot;Trainers Edition&amp;quot; card game. &amp;quot;World Arts On Playing Cards&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As most, who are familiar with our games know, Martial World is an American style strategy game, which challenges players to win martial arts based sparring matches, using technique based &amp;quot;micro messaged&amp;quot; collectible cards. These combat strategy card games combine point-trick mechanics with card-capturing mechanics for deck building purposes. We call the deck building process &amp;quot;Building Your Form&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game box is designed for 2 to 5 players, intended for anyone ages 7 and up, comes with a single magnifying glass, (for a limited time) and no martial arts experience is necessary. Games are easy to learn, easy to develop flexible strategies, and average 90 minutes to establish a winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fun is how cleverly the combination of multiple forms of martial arts technique terms, combine into round robin melees of attacks, blocks, and counter maneuvers. Here's how. Players spar in rounds which are initiated by the role of the dice and the round winners keeps the technique cards to add to their form. Another fun feature for players who are not sparring is that they may enjoy the micro messages which, for the white belt levels, display each school's core principals and values. You may even be surprised that most of these messages can be applied to every day life. So playing has good life benefits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ultimately our novel mechanics, embedded surprises, and our school based narrative features, provide players the opportunity to experience the many benefits of martial arts without the Epson salt. All may play and enjoy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designer's Note: All of our games are designed based on the history of real martial arts and may include many of each school's or style's myths. However folks, this is a game. Let's be honest, the only way to truly learn any form of Martial Arts is to do research and depending on your ideals, you will find a style which appeals you. Besides that, we are a USA based company and our games are made in America. We were originally published in 1992 but needed a lot of work. We kept pushing and in 2011 we were nominated for the Gaming Genius Awards as the best new card game. We were finalists but needed many upgrades. So we upgraded everything. Lastly we are members of our local gaming group CABS and have a membership with the Patent Tested Parent Approved association.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We welcome all feedback and recommendations. You may also zoom in to all of our pictures for samples of hidden surprises...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
