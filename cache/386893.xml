						               													<description>Amazing Auction is an auction game where the items you bid on are a combination of cards from two decks - one based on adjectives (e.g. used or mediocre) and one based on nouns (e.g. impressionist painting or sock).  Together, each pair of cards show a number which determines the value of the item up for auction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The noun deck is formed from cards which each player sees some of privately.  Part way through the game, this deck stops being revealed until the item has been auctioned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start the game with 10 coins and cannot gain additional money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most points when all items have been auctioned wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
