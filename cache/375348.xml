						               													<description>Oda Nobunaga once said that he would hunt his enemies down &amp;quot;on every hill and valley.&amp;quot; That term, in Japanese, is &amp;quot;yama yama tani tani&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Yama Yama Tani Tani 2 or 4 players choose from among 6 different Chinese warlords of the Three Kingdoms era or from among 6 different Japanese daimyo of the Warring States period to battle each other in a no-luck, no-dice faceoff for supremacy in their respective countries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each leader comes with his 9 most trusted generals and must be divided into two armies of five units each. Players select their first 5-man army for the first battle, and assign each general a troop type based on that generals allowances and the strategic advantages that player wants to pursue. Then each player assigns those units to the first battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Generals move about the battlefield, attacking enemy generals, but with a twist. The skills that each general has allow him to do more than just make basic attacks. They allow him to both manipulate the enemy units and his own to his advantage, but, more importantly, the correct use of a skill can trigger another friendly general to use one of his skills, adding more damage to the attack. That general's use of a skill could trigger another, an so on. The real strategy is trying to make the most of your generals' skills and build wildly powerful combos of attacks on the battlefield to destroy your opponent's army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After each battle, the winning player gains Mandate according to the number of his generals still alive. After 6 battles, if one player has more Mandate, that player is the winner. If players are tied, there will be a 7th and final battle, using all 10 of those players' generals, to determine the victor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
