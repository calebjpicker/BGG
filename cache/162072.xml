						               													<description>The Peides Curse: Earth is a strategic and tactical game in which players take on the role of heroes who are embarking on an audacious and dangerous rescue mission. They face the uncertainty of time travel that bring them to the future year of 2223 where they will join the Spirit and fight a tough battle to stop the power of Evil. In order to accomplish the objective of their mission, the players shall participate in the race of their lives to find 9 secret codes that will stop Evil from wielding its power and destroying Earth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is required to put into motion his or her most strategic plan and creative cunningness to plot successfully and beat the other players to be the first to find all the secret codes. The game uses two different decks of power card play / power travel to help the players navigate to their designated mission destination. In this phase, players must cleverly maneuver their moves to put into motion their plans and strategy. The game play takes on an infusion of race and prior planning. High levels of strategy deployment or plotting, combined with tactical maneuvers, is required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the quest to &amp;#239;&amp;#172;&amp;#129;nd the secret codes, the players are required to follow the clues which will lead them to where they are hidden. They then need to decipher the code with the decoder dices. Successful attempts shall be rewarded with energy points and battle &amp;#239;&amp;#172;&amp;#130;ags. They are both critical game changing components that will propel the players to lead in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last phase of the race shall see them being pitted in the battle between the Spirit and Evil. Here, the players will be able to deploy actions or movements that will keep them safe. The battle card may also be a game killer if it is played correctly. The players need to be extra cautious at this stage because they may well fall prey to 3 &amp;lsquo;surprise&amp;rsquo; cards in the stack. This can cause them to deplete their Vourton power and lose a turn when they meet face to face with Evil. However, all is not lost. There are saviour cards that will restore the players&amp;rsquo; power immediately without losing a turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
