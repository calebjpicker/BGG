						               													<description>Trifoil is a long-form, 2 player turn based strategy game in the vein of chess or go that can be played with 6 or more Blinks. Players take turns placing links, pushing them, and rotating sections of the board to try to build a long chain before their opponent can.&amp;#10;The rules are flexible along with the initial board state, so the game can evolve to be simple, complex, or even just different depending on what you want to play!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup&amp;#10;The base board setup with 6 blinks is as follows:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 2 players, red and blue. The board's background color is lit up with the current player's color. Each turn, players can use up to 2 actions (see available actions), except for the first turn of the game where a player can only use one action.&amp;#10;A player wins when they have a chain of 5 links of their own color! The game also ends when either player has placed 9 links, in which case the player with the longest chain wins (see end game rules).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;On the first turn of the game, the player going first only gets 1 action. Every turn afterwards each player gets 2 actions. Note: You cannot make a move which returns the board to the previous board state.&amp;#10;Place a link&amp;#10;You can place a link by first clicking the blink you wish to place on, then clicking the blink touching the face (direction) where want to place the link&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This means that you can't place any links facing outwards from the formation.&amp;#10;Spin&amp;#10;You can disconnect, rotate, and reattach one of 3-blink triangles that form the corners of the board as one of your actions. They are labelled &amp;quot;&amp;Delta;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;Omega;&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;&amp;theta;&amp;quot; in the board above!&amp;#10;Players are allowed to do this ONLY if they have less links on that triangle than their opponents. This is referred to as the &amp;quot;minority rule.&amp;quot; If they have the same amount of links as the opponent, they cannot spin it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Push&amp;#10;You can push a link outwards from a Blink the using the same input as placing a link. E.g. if you attempt to place a link where a link already exists, you will instead push it--pushing any other links in the way in a straight line as well! You can only push links of your own color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending your turns&amp;#10;Once you have made your moves, double click any Blink to commit a move and pass the turn to the other player&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Win Condition&amp;#10;Be the first to create a chain of at least 5 links. Only 2 links to Blinks are counted toward the final score. Scale chain length according to amount of Blinks (see below)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Variations&amp;#10;The rulebook and the board are flexible, so use your imagination--the possibilities are endless! See Examples below&amp;#10;Rule Variations&amp;#10;Try limiting number the total number of links you can place to . If either player runs out of links, the player with the longest chain wins.&amp;#10;Try playing until any one Blink is filled with 6 links of any color. When that happens, the longest chain wins.&amp;#10;Try playing with 3 moves instead of 2! You might need to increase the winning chain length.&amp;#10;Removing the limit of links that a Blink can contribute to a chain creates a much more defensive game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
