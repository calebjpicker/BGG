						               													<description>Contents: 1 playing board, 4 Wood Pawns, 13 Question Cards (Ellsworth's letters), 1 spinner&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Number of Players: 2, 3 or 4&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the game starts:&amp;#10;1. The card portion of the platform should be broken up into 13 individual cards which are called the &amp;quot;LETTERS&amp;quot;. The LETTERS are then placed, FACE UP, in a POOL next to the playing board, in easy reach of all players.&amp;#10;2. Each player then selects a wood pawn and places it on the space marked &amp;quot;START&amp;quot; in the center of playing board&amp;#10;3. Each player now spins the arrow of the spinner - the one with the highest number starts. In case of tie, player spins again.&amp;#10;4. Play passes to the left&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object of the game:&amp;#10;The player who is FIRST to enter Ellsworth's House with the most LETTERS, is the WINNER.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special Feature of the Game:&amp;#10;This game consists of two parts - the first from START to the GATE - the second from the GATE to ELLSWORTH's HOUSE, including the HOME PATH and BONUS SPACE&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Play:&amp;#10;1. In the first part of the game (area from START to GATE) the first player spins and moves his pawn the number of spaces in any direction he chooses (either forward of backward). Player can never split his move and must always move on his turn according to the number he spins.&amp;#10;2. Any number of players may rest on the same space at the same time.&amp;#10;3. Whenever a player, in the first part of the game, lands on a color space by EXACT COUNT, he picks up the LETTER with the matching color stamp from the POOL. He must read aloud the question on that letter and the three different answers given below it. He then must state aloud which ANSWER he thinks is right, A, B or C. Each question on the LETTERS is numbered and the ANSWER CHART here in the box cover lists these numbers with their correct answers - A, B or C. If he has answered correctly, he gets a bonus move of 10 additional spaces. If his answer is incorrect, he remains on that color space until his next turn. In either case, he keeps the LETTER.&amp;#10;4. Each player has to place the LETTERS he picks, FACE UP in front of him, so that all players around the board can see them.&amp;#10;5. As long as there are LETTERS left in the POOL, NO player can enter the second part of the game. After the last LETTER has been picked up from the POOL, all players place their respective pawns on the space marked GATE and all start from there equally on the second part of the game.&amp;#10;6. From the GATE to the Beginning of the HOME PATH, players move only in a forward direction.&amp;#10;7. Whenever a player in the second part of the game lands by EXACT COUNT on a color space, he has this choice - he may take the matching color LETTER from the player who has it, or, he may advance 10 spaces.&amp;#10;8. The section of the pathway from the last color space to Ellsworth's House, is the HOME PATH. Once a player advances into the HOME PATH, he moves within it, forward or backward as he chooses. When a player lands by EXACT COUNT on the BONUS SPACE, he may take from any other player any LETTER he desires, regardless of the color stamp.&amp;#10;9. Since a plyer cannot win, unless he enters ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE with the most LETTERS, he will move back and forth within the HOME PATH until hes has more letters than the other players. As LETTERS can be taken away in the HOME PATH, there is great excitement and suspense. Until the last moment of the game, nobody knows who will safely enter ELLSWORTH'S HOUSE.&amp;#10;10. To enter ELLSWORTH's HOUSE, a player does not need an exact count on the spinner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FAMILY RULES&amp;#10;When more advanced children or grown-ups join the the game, the regular rules are followed, except that in the first part of the game, all questions and answers are omitted when players pick up LETTERS, but the bonus move of 10 spaces is still given.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
