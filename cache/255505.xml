						               													<description>New 2018 expansion for Mythic Battles Pantheon&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With Dionysus, we didn't want to create a combat-oriented unit, but rather a control oriented unit that represented opulence and chaos.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Let's start by looking at the power &amp;quot;Orgiastic Procession&amp;quot; which aims to simulate the arrival of Dionysus, accompanied by one of his procession. This power gives the player several troops who, themselves, have many activation cards. The goal is to support the notion of opulence, which is emphasized by the number of &amp;quot;art of war&amp;quot; cards that brings Dionysus, as well as a high number of life points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The satyr children also help Dionysus controlling the map because they all possess the block talent. However, we don&amp;rsquo;t imagine that it is by physical might they manage to block off their enemies; it is because the units in their areas are too busy drinking their wine and feasting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The power of the satyr children makes it clear that Dionysus is not here to kill the opponents by fighting, but on the contrary, for them to lose themselves in the chaotic bliss of merriment. This power greatly disrupts an opponent's position and, in effect, offers significant control on the map to Dionysus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the satyr children can neither attack nor collect gems, we imagine it is because they are busy serving wine to all the units in their area. This is represented by their block talent, as we have seen above, but also by the Bolster talent of the troops and the intoxicating power of Dionysus. This power, meanwhile, can generate chaos in the opponent's cards by forcing him to discard cards from his deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Clearly, Dionysus can be a technical unit to play, due to his low mobility which requires careful placement on the map. Despite this, he is ubiquitous on the field and has the capability to disrupt the opponent's strategy. This, combined with the fact that he can send satyr children to bring him Omphalos (simulated by the talent gem collector), allows one to achieve victory by attaining Omphalos.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
