						               													<description>The Pressman Are You Normal? Board Game asks questions that reveal funny and honest answers to see where you fit on the normal scale. For instance: Have you ever laughed so hard that something can out of your nose? 100 people were polled for each question to determine what is and what isn't considered normal. Guess and bet on answers to ramp up the fun while discovering where you and your friends land on the scale. Based on the short-lived 2012 OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network) TV game show Are You Normal, America? hosted by Barry Poznick and Kim Coles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object:&amp;#10;If 2 Players, be the first player to reach 20 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If 3 Players, be the first player to reach 30 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If 4 Players, be the first player to reach 40 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If 5 players, be the first player to reach 50 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If 6 Players, be the first player to reach 60 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;Game board, 200 question cards, 42 tokens, 12 voting cards (6 yes, 6 no), scorepad.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set Up:&amp;#10;Each player takes the 7 tokens of the Yes/No color zero near them and one &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; and one &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; voting card of that same color. Mix the question cards and place them face down, in reaching distance of all players. One player takes the score sheet to keep track of all the players' scores.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing:&amp;#10;The player who claims to be the most &amp;quot;NORMAL&amp;quot; of the group starts the game. Then play moves clockwise. On your turn, read the top question card out loud. All players, including the player who read the card, place their &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; voting card face down in front of them based on their own personal experience: &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; if you have or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; if you have not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players now place one of their own tokens on the Yes/No section of all the other players, guessing whether each player said &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; to the action on the question. At the same time all players (except the reader) have to guess what percentage of people who were polled on the question card said &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; and place one of their tokens on the percentage circles in the middle of the board that they feel is correct. Starting with the player whose turn it is, reveal your answer and score the points, one for each correct guess for each player and two for each correct guess in the percentage area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, players have one opportunity to &amp;quot;Double Down&amp;quot;, (i.e. place 2 tokens on one of the percentage circles in the middle of the board). After scores have been written, players take back their color tokens and the next player will be the reader.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending and Winning the Game:&amp;#10;Play continues until one player accumulates the required amount of points as outlined in the beginning of the rules. Now you will find out who actually is the most &amp;quot;NORMAL&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
