						               													<description>Hong Kong: Summer 2019 is a miniatures tabletop game based on the series of events started since summer 2019 in Hong Kong.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game the players act as the protesters against Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong. A lot of videos taken by the protestors showcased the unnecessary violence exerted by the police force, the events keep going for more than half a year till the time of written.&amp;#10;We hoped to let the players experience what ridiculous events had happened in Hong Kong during this time in the form of a tabletop RPG board game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a miniatures RPG game mixed with deck building elements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players construct their own action decks which consist of different attack moves, defensive moves and other special moves. They can also acquire new moves through the missions. They are free to take out cards and add cards to their decks for the next missions. Remember, a bigger deck size also means it is harder to draw some wanted cards. Players must consider and make effective decks instead of adding all the cards they get.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is turn-based. Every player performs different actions like these:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Move &amp;ndash; move the player on the map based on its speed, sometimes they can have special moves with some special action cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attack &amp;ndash; Players can play cards from their hands to perform different attacks, they have different attribute requirements and the players often have to roll a set of dice to determine the attack strength.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When an action card is used once, it is discarded. When the player runs out of action cards, he needs to find a safe place to rest to replenish the deck! But they come back automatically once the current mission is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Search &amp;ndash; Players can search the objects on the map and will trigger sudden events, often they have to choose between two options, but sometimes they don't have a choice, it is instead determined by some current conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Specials &amp;ndash; There are many special moves, like healing wounds, dealing with tear gas, take videos, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Save Others &amp;ndash; In some missions there are NPC protectors spawning on the map, the players can save them by moving to them and clear the enemies nearby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As this is a coop game, the enemy&amp;rsquo;s turn would be played according to the AI deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Remember, do not advance to the very front line always as this is a very hard game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are different objectives in different missions, like saving protesters, surviving for some turns, protect the Lennon walls, setting road blocks, collecting police violence evidence, expose to the mass through the six months.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Those are just what would happen in one mission, between the missions the players can use the experience earned to upgrade their attributes, get more action moves and construct their own action decks, etc. And remember the final goal is to survive through the missions till November, and increase the mass supports (an in-game value) by that time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer'&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
