						               													<description>Paris, the city of lights, love and arts. An exotic location with all its glory. Unfortunately, it is also a perfect place for an act of heist! In Le Voleur (the thief), you will gather a team of thieves trying to steal loots from various districts in downton Paris. Be mindful with your steps because not only you have to plan carefully and dodge the patrolling police, but rumor says there are other teams trying to expose you! Be careful with your planning and notes, because even a slightest mistake might ruin your perfectly planned heist!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Le Voleur is a logic-strategic game for 2 to 4 players. There are 2 main mechanics going on: the main board with area control and player board with deduction. On the main board, players need to create patterns by flipping colored tokens. With the right pattern, players can Scout and finally Steal the good. To flip the tokens, players need to use one of the Abilities of their agents, 4 are taken randomly from bag at setup, by turning their Agent's dial to show the desired abilities (shared color with the token on the board). Other players may mark these abilities on their player board, called Headquarter, which also shows the identity of all agents available in the game. Everytime an Agent use their abilities these clue grows and eventually reveal the Agent correct identity.&amp;#10; The game played in 8 turns. Each turn are consist of several phases and each phase shows how many agents a player can play. If a player have less than 4 agents, he eventually lost all ability to use any actions on that phase and can only recruit new agents. Victory Points are collected by either Steal a Good or exposing other Agents. The first player with 5 Victory Points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
