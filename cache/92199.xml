						               													<description>Treason is a 2 players game. Each participant will build up its influence in a medieval town, ultimately, resulting in the deposition of the king. As the game progresses intrigue, allegiances, conspiracy, combat, cunning and treason occur.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You must allure strong allies to your hand by doing successful quests for them; or buy favours of some society members in order to sabotage your competitor&amp;rsquo;s game. Do business with witches, knights, thieves, assassins, merchants and many other society members. Secretly conspire against your opponent. Acquire items to increase the chances of achieving success in quests or create unexpected setbacks to your opponent. The player who ends the game with the largest number of influence points (gained either by doing tasks or by performing dirty jobs) is the one that will take the King&amp;rsquo;s throne and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No matter your background or social status, victory is only a step away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, the players draw cards from several decks &amp;ndash; tasks, allies/quest, influence/conspiracy and store decks. The accumulation of influence is of extreme importance and the players will do this by performing assignments, dictated by tasks cards. This will increase their coins and reputation. They also have the possibility of either using their character&amp;rsquo;s skills to perform quests for members of society, by drawing quest cards, or machinate evil plans against its opponents, by drawing cards from a conspiracy deck. There&amp;rsquo;s also the possibility of buying items that will aid players perform quests by adding bonus points to base character skills, such as combat points and services that will allow to affect dramatically the other player&amp;rsquo;s game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a turn, each player will follow a stream of steps originated by the cards drawn from each deck. Luck and careful planning work hand in hand in this game.&amp;#10; Goal&amp;#10; The game&amp;rsquo;s goal is to increase one&amp;rsquo;s influence in this medieval society and alluring powerful allies. Players will accumulate influence (see above) by perfoming honest tasks, dirty jobs for important members of society and attracting allies to your cause. Ultimately the King&amp;rsquo;s deposition will happen as soon as he is stripped of social, military and political support.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
