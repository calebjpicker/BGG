						               													<description>Hex Up! contains 6 different games that will bring you 6 different game experiences.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Individual game variants:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pack. Everyone plays at the same time, no matter the order. Players take hexes from the table, combine them on top of each other and layer them on top of the community deck in the rack. Each player's job is to quickly find a suitable hex, or suitably combine two hexes on top of each other in their hand and place it on the deck in the rack, suits up. The move cannot be corrected once it has been placed.&amp;#10;     &amp;#10;    Land. Each player has their own topping deck of hexes (face down in front of them), with 3 hexes laid out face up in front of them, and an initial supply of chips. Players regularly rotate their turns clockwise. Once all players have run out of their reload pack and their unloaded supply of hexes, the game ends and the player with the most coins wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Speed. Each player creates their own top-up deck from their hexes, and places it face down in front of them. The game ends when all players have run out of hexes in the replenishment deck. The player with the most coins wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bluff: The object of the game is to get as many coins as possible by collecting all suits in a player's hand. The player with the most coins at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Think. The solving team closes their eyes, the entering team stacks the assignment on the table. On command, the solving team looks at the table and views the assignment for 1 minute. The team's task is to identify which suits and in which positions are hidden on the covered assignment by placing the corresponding chips around the card. The solving team gets as many coins as they hit the correct colors and holes. In the next round, the teams' roles are reversed. The team with the most coins after six rounds wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Code: The object of the game is to get as many coins as possible, which a player gets whenever his personal color combination appears on the deck.  The game ends when all players run out of hexes both in the recharge deck and in their hand. The player with the most coins wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
