Visit four of six locations, then return to either the camp or the prison. Use new weapons and fate cards to survive the zombie apocalypse &amp;mdash; but beware because if you die, you turn against your fellow survivors. All you'll want is their brains. Good hunting!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Streets of Atlanta allows up to six players to compete with newly designed character cards to match the look of season three of the AMC TV show The Walking Dead. Other features of this expansion:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Updated special abilities for each characters&amp;#10;Each character has his unique matching special ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 20 Scrounge Cards&amp;#10;For six player support!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 6 new playable Characters&amp;#10;Choose Daryl, T-Dog, Michonne, Maggie, Carl and Hershel&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 4 Zombie character pieces inclusive female zombies and zombified version of the survivors&amp;#10;You can choose more default Zombie Pieces to hunt the survivors or switch to the zombified version of your character.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 6 Special Ability Tokens&amp;#10;Now you can track, if a special ability has been used up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 1 Team Zombie, 1 Team Survivor Token, 8 Ally Tokens and 8 Location Tiles&amp;#10;For six player support!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added new Encounter Cards&amp;#10;More variety of Walkers will try to kill you on the streets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Replaced original map with 16 Map Tiles for a new random map every game&amp;#10;You don't longer need the original Game Board. With 16 Street-Squares called Map Tiles you build a different Atlanta each game. Every new game needs a new strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 2 new Corner Locations: The Fuel Station and the Pawn Shop&amp;#10;Introducing new Locations to the game. With the Pawn Shop, you can get Fate Cards or your Special Ability back. Or you decide to visit the Fuel Station to get more movement with Jerry Cans. You still need only 4 Locations. It's your decision.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 2 minor new Buildings: Motorcycle Shop and Firestation&amp;#10;These buildings can upgrade your character, if you got the special Fate Card in your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 12 Jerrycans for the Fuel Station&amp;#10;Jerry Cans are everywhere in Atlanta. You can collect Jerry Cans for the Fuel Station to provide your character a faster movement. But watch out, other survivors want them too.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 27 different types of fate cards for advanced strategy (total 45 cards)&amp;#10;This is a brand new deck of cards. Fate cards are kept hidden in your hand and can be played on yourself or on other survivors. Some are good, some are nasty. Are you a good guy or a bad one?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 18 different types of INCIDENT Cards for unpredictable board incidents (total 20 cards)&amp;#10;This is also a brand new deck of cards. Incident Cards are drawn, if you roll a 1 on the incident die. The card will tell you, what happens to the board, survivors and/or walkers. They may be good or bad. You may change your strategy to some incidents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added Prison Map Tile (Alternate Camp)&amp;#10;You can head back with your 4 Locations to the Camp or try the saver way to the new Prison. But be careful, the prison has many fences and you have to stop many times to get into the building.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added 6 different new Walker Cards&amp;#10;Walker Player get 6 new different Walker Cards to kill the remaining survivors&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- New Sewer System&amp;#10;Walkers can use Sewers to move quickly through Atlanta to head up the survivors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Added New Encounter Boss Cards: Walker Herd, The Governor and Merle Dixon&amp;#10;With the new encounters, there are Boss Fights.
