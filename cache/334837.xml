						               													<description>Armi&amp;ntilde;o (Ermine in Spanish language), was the fur clothes sported by Catholic Monarchs in Medieval Europe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cloth board and cards of this game emulate those luxury garments. Beside the board, the game consists in 44 field cards, 10 special cards, 2 player aid cards and the instructions. All components are made in Spain from small manufacturers. No plastic components.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of designers was to take some mechanics of different games trying to make their own version of Gwent. Tough, the idea evolved and mixed some concepts from Age of Empires, Stratego, or even Carcasonne.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Armi&amp;ntilde;o the board and scenario is always changing, allowing a great replayability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Plays can last from 1 to 30 minutes, depending on strategy and luck. At the beginning of the game, the red carpet will be displayed between contestants, each of them having a King card from the maze. Then, the rest of the 42 field cards (white back) must be mixed and both players shall receive 17 face down cards. Then, the special cards (black back) will be mixed too and just one will be given to each player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player will choose how to place cards on the cloth board. Decisions on how to place them will be based just in strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each card has an effect written on it, so each turn a player must do an action with the cards. Move them or use them according to its effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The special cards (epic, meteorite, transmute or breeze among them) can be used all along the game as many times as needed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Easy to learn but hard to master, Armi&amp;ntilde;o is a strategic card game of medieval combat for two players, whose goal is to kill the opponent's king. Fast and destructive, in the eventuality you could not achieve the regicide, the winner will be the player obtaining most victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
