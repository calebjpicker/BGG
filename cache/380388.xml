						               													<description>The strategy of the game is based on the fact that success in life can be achieved through education and effective work.  Players perform the same actions as in real life: go to school and work, earn money, buy food, acquire personal property, pay utility bills.  Players all the time have to plan their income and expenses, as well as their actions during the working day, week, month.  The game helps to acquire financial decision-making skills and choose your development strategy on the path to success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player on his turn can visit from one of the three city buildings on the game board. Moving between buildings is possible both on foot and by taxi.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are several types of buildings: buildings in which the player works; buildings in which the player spends earned money (shops); buildings in which the player receives improvements in personal skills (educational institutions).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An example of a building where the player earns money is a factory. Arriving at the factory, the player rolls a die and, depending on the result of the roll, the player receives a certain amount of money earned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gradually, the player buys more items for himself in the house. As soon as any of the players has 10 items at home, 5000 units of currency after paying off all loans and utility bills, then that player wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
