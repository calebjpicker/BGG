						               													<description>Promotional family game, published by Mercedes Benz &amp;amp; Ravensburger.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Theme&amp;#10;A road trip with grandma, grandpa, mum, dad and three children, who all have to be put into the car so that you can be the first to reach the holiday destination.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal&amp;#10;Be the first to reach the finish line by successfully completing activities and being lucky in a roll-and-move part.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play&amp;#10;The game is divided into two phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In phase 1, players try to fill their car (= their player board) as fast as possible. They do so by completing tasks from the activity cards. &amp;#10;The first area of the board shows a track consisting of spaces in six different colours. There is one pawn for all the players. Players take turns rolling the die and move the pawn accordingly. Depending on the colour of the space the pawn lands on, the active player has to &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     mime or draw one of two words from the card and the other players guess what it is, &amp;#10;     read a story from the card and everyone guesses if it is true or false, &amp;#10;     guess if the other players will raise an even or an odd number of fingers, &amp;#10;     write down what they associate with a word, and the other players have to guess. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players who successfully complete a task and players who guess correctly get to spin a spinner showing the different family members. If they haven't already got this family member, they take a matching chip and put it on their player board. Otherwise they have to gift it to someone else.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the pawn lands on a light or dark pink space, players play &amp;quot;The magical 7&amp;quot; (trying to come as close as possible to 7 with two die rolls - the winner spins the spinner) or &amp;quot;Spinner poker&amp;quot; (betting one of your chips to get to spin the spinner twice - if the spinner points towards the family member you were betting on, you win that chip, otherwise you lose the one you bet).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 2: Once a player has filled his/her car, he/she proceeds to the second part of the board. Here, each player has a car pawn. Players try to reach the finish line as fast as possible. Obstacle tokens and event spaces make you lose or win family members. If a player lands on a space that is already occupied, he/she can steal a family member to fill an empty spot in their own car.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to reach the finish line wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
