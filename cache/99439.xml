						               													<description>In Kosminen kierros (&amp;quot;Cosmic Tour&amp;quot;), the players are astronauts flying in a spaceship circumnavigating and exploring the solar system. Each player shares responsibility for ensuring that the ship makes it safely back to Earth, but at the same time should try to collect as much information about the solar system to win the game when the ship makes it back to Earth.&amp;#10;The game has two separate game boards. The first board represents the solar system, on which the players' spaceship pawn is moved. If the ship flies off the grid, hits a planet or the sun, the ship is destroyed and all players lose the game. The board also includes Event-markers, which are turned over when the ship flies on them, and have a surprising impact on game play.&amp;#10;The other board represents the inside of the spaceship, where players move their astronaut pawns. Each turn, a player must move from one module of the spaceship to another and carry out an action. The actions that can be carried out in the different modules are:&amp;#10;-Bridge: turn the ship's inclination (to determine which direction the ship moves in)&amp;#10;-Observatory: draw two Data cards (giving points at the end of the game)&amp;#10;-Storage: draw two Equipment cards (useful items to be used during the game to save the ship from destruction or help the player's own game&amp;#10;-Engine room: move the ship pawn forward one step.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has three levels of game play with increasing complexity. On level two, Captain's Orders cards are added to the game, which are played whenever a player moves to the Bridge, giving that player an additional action. Also, the scoring system for Data cards becomes based on set collection. On level three, Escape pods are included, which allow a player to win the game even if the ship is destroyed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game was custom designed to order, and is intended mainly for a specific target market, i.e. children aged 8-14. It is an educational game at heart, in which the players learn about the solar system, and the importance of working together for a common goal, while having lots of fun. But naturally anybody can play it, and it works specially well as a game that the whole family can enjoy together&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
