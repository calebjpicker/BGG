						               													<description>Top Dog is a fun and competitive card game for social interactions with family members and friends of all ages. Be the first player to get rid of all your cards by outplaying your opponents. Use combinations of dogs and power dogs to empty your hand first. Copy Cats can complete a dog stack and clear the Dogpile on any turn while Dog Catchers can clear the Dogpile and send them running to dog pound on your turn. Use Copy Cats and Dog Catchers wisely to outwit and defeat your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will have dog cards, which they may play in combinations, and Power Dogs, which they may also play in combinations. There are also Copy Cats, which are essentially wild cards and Dog Catchers, which immediately send all dogs to the Dog Pound, which is where all the cards that were completed from the Dogpile go. The cards in the Dog Pound will not be used until the round is over and a new round begins.&amp;#10; The first player places a card or combinations of cards on the Dogpile, which is the pile of played cards in the middle of the table. Play then continues to the left. During your turn, you can play a card or a combination of cards that are of higher value than the last played. However, your turn can be taken away if a Completion occurs by another player before the player whose turn it is can play a card. A completion occurs when there are 4 of the same type of cards on the Dogpile. Completions can be played out of turn regardless of how many cards are being played on the Dogpile. The same type of cards can be stacked to increase the value of the Dogpile. For example, you can Stack a single card on a double if they are of the same type. If a player can not play on the Dogpile, that player has to draw from the Dog House (Draw Deck) until they can play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first person to run out of cards in the round wins the round, and the first person to win 3 rounds is the Top Dog.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
