						               													<description>Perfil Express Filmes e S&amp;eacute;ries brings a new way to play the classic 20 Questions game with categories inspired by streaming and movie screens!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game comes with 100 themed cards with movies and TV shows, each card has 10 tips worth up to 10 points. The first tip is less revealing, and the following ones progressively increase the chances of success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This version was specially designed to be played by two people or two teams, without the need for a board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With a new scoring system on a marker, the winner will be the one who scores the most points during five rounds, that is, after five cards have or have not guessed their identities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
