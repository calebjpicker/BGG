						               													<description>Rescue is a game of collecting equipment and survivors to overcome obstacles and being crowned as the winner. Players will take on the role of a wandering wastelander attempting to survive post-apocalyptic earth. Players must use equipment and action cards to overcome various obstacles and threats. In the process, they will enhance themselves and the survivors they rescue with loot, uncover lore, and stab their fellow players in the back.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is played in a series of 10 rounds consisting of two phases. The first phase of the round is the player action phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 1: Action Phase&amp;#10;During this round, players may take the following actions. Steal a card from another player (excluding a survivor card), apply a piece of equipment to a survivor, or draw from the cache deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Steal a Card: When stealing a card, the individual having the card stolen will shuffle the fail card and the desired card together. The thief will then pick from one of the two cards. The card is not stolen if the fail card is selected from the two.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Apply Survivor Equipment: A player may apply spare equipment cards to any survivors they may have acquired. If the survivor is lost due to failing an event, the equipment applied to the survivor is also lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Draw a Card: If a player selects this option, draw one card from the cache deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After performing one of the above described actions, the player may then apply or remove equipment cards to themselves by placing them in front of themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, the first phase ends with players ensuring they have no more than five cards in their hands (unless they have a backpack applied). To accomplish this, they may discard any additional cards and place them in the discard pile or give spare cards to any other player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 2: Event Phase&amp;#10;During this phase, all players will be presented with an event. If they defeat the obstacle, they gain a prize as annotated on the card. If a player cannot defeat an obstacle, they must perform the loss action. Each player does not get an individual event. One event card is drawn, and all players must overcome that same event. If a player has zero survivors and the loss condition is to discard a survivor card, that player is eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To defeat an obstacle, the players must have a stat number equal to or greater than the stat/stats being challenged. There are four stats that could be challenged, and those are Strength (STR), Accuracy (ACC), Intelligence (INT), and Stamina (STA). Each piece of equipment has stat/stats. Add the stat/stats required for the challenge to determine if you will defeat it.&amp;#10;Note: Equipment cards can not be equipped or unequipped during this phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning: Have the most survivor cards at the end of the ten rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
