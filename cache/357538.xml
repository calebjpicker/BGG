						               													<description>It is the archaeological find of the century!  The fabled lost &amp;ldquo;Temple of the Crocodile&amp;rdquo; has been unearthed deep in the jungles and we are sending you in to investigate the find!  It is rumored that buried deep inside the temple, there is a secret.  One that might change mankind as we know it.  EMIT tried to keep the discovery a secret, but our arch-rival, Mr. X, seems to have hacked our systems and is hot on our heels.  He has sent his own agents to the temple to challenge you to the find.  TWO games await you within this adventure.  Find your way through the temple, discovering secret passages in an attempt to gain access to the treasure.  Then, try to find a way to escape the temple, as a series of fiendish traps are set against you.  That isn&amp;rsquo;t it, though.  Your team will be presented with a choice at the beginning of the game.  Play together as one team to beat Mr. X&amp;rsquo;s agents and find the treasure together as a team OR split into two competing groups.  Some players may have the opportunity to join Mr. X and challenge the remainder of the group to see who gets to the treasure first&amp;hellip;  Will you defeat Mr. X as a team&amp;hellip; or will you turn against each other in a chance for eternal glory?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;About Escape the Crate escape room boxes:&amp;#10;Each box has over a dozen unique puzzles which all fit the theme. Every item in the box has a purpose and will help you escape in time. Clue are hidden everywhere and in this game you need to think inside the box. Each box is a complete story.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These missions can be challenging and it is very possible you won't escape before the time limit. You can always reset the game using our instructions or you can continue playing past the time limit to see the mission to completion.&amp;#10;Every challenge you will face will have a set of hints, which you can choose to reveal when your team needs them. If you are completely stumped, even after the hints, the solution is also provided.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: You will need a fully charged computer or mobile device to play this escape room.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
