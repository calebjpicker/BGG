						               													<description>Between funny characters, forced exchanges and twists, whoever loses the five tokens is eliminated. Who will resist until the end?  &amp;#10;A card game for everyone with an engaging mechanism, from 4 to 10.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is given five tokens of the same color.  The oldest player shuffles the cards well and places the deck in the center of the table.  The objective of the game is not to remain at the end of the round with the lowest card in hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting with the player to the right of the one who shuffled the cards, and proceeding counterclockwise, each competitor draws a card from the deck, observes it and keeps it face down in front of him.  The player who drew the card first begins and, based on the value of the card drawn, he can decide: to keep the card, because he believes it is a high card;  &amp;bull; to exchange a card that he considers low with the player to his right, who cannot refuse to accept the trade, unless he is in possession of one of the highest five cards (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), which he must reveal to block the trade. The round continues counterclockwise and ends when all the competitors have made their trades. The last player of the round (the one who shuffled the cards) can decide whether to keep the card he drew (or received from an exchange), or he can make the exchange himself by drawing a card from the top of the deck.  Once the play has been made, he reveals the card and invites the other players who have not revealed theirs to do the same.  At this point the player who owns the card with the lowest value among those revealed pays a token.  If two or more players have the same lowest card, they pay one token each.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues by playing another round in the same way.  The deck is shuffled in turn (counterclockwise). * When a player loses all five tokens in his possession during the various rounds, he leaves the game.  The others continue to play until there is only one player left, who is the winner of the game.  If, at the end of the game, there are two players left with only one token and, at the end of a round, both have the same card, neither of them pays a token and we proceed indefinitely.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If, at the end of a round, at least two players discover a Jolly Cat, none of them pays a token and the players eliminated during the previous rounds will be able to return to the game with a token!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
