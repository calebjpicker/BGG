						               													<description>Game description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scratch Wars is close to a collectible game, but in certain game modes it's closer to a board game and can be also played online through a phone application for iOS and Android.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, to start playing Scratch Wars you need only two cards: one hero and one weapon. The cards are unique in several aspects. You can scratch them like lottery tickets, but by doing so you are not destroying or devaluing them. Each hero card is unique; each hero has a unique name and value generated. No one else in the world will have the same card! Slowly uncover the card by scratching it and in combination with unique values, it is pleasantly thrilling. Cards can even be bought individually. (Would you rather have a hero or a weapon?)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With an increasing number of weapon cards, you can try a sophisticated one-on-one duel in which you equip your hero with up to five weapons, then think strategically to find out which one to use when. The duel itself is very interesting; you spin a special circular weapon: turntable paper on a stick. The hero has certain levels of energy which you spend using various weapons. Heroes can change weapons during the turn and their proper use is the focus of the game. The game is risk management; you are trying to spend the hero's energy for the best possible effects. According to the composition of effects, you choose weapon, strategy and risk. You can attack the opponent's weapon, his permanent effects, or the hero directly. You have to decide when to repair a weapon, when to save energy for the hit with more powerful weapons, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you get into the basic game, you can try a more comprehensive and strategic mode in which teams of heroes compete against each other. Then you can move to the top mode where entire armies of heroes collide. With more than two players, it is possible to play in teams or each player plays by themselves with modified rules. The game is perfect for tournaments.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you want to play with just one player, simply scan the card into your phone and you can play online. There is a varied range of options at your disposal, from tournaments and hero trainings to territorial fights. The goal is to level your hero up and obtain spells for him. As the first game in the world, Scratch Wars presents digital ownership so that what you have physically, you also have digitally. If you later want to replace or sell any of your heroes, you can change them digitally with all that is recorded on the card, i.e., with all the spells and experiences.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you would rather play the game more as a board game and add more strategic options, you will be able to expand the game with &amp;quot;trade&amp;quot; cards or hero's &amp;quot;abilities&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
