						               													<description>Lexicons of Dueling is fast to learn, fast to play, and has hundreds of possible variations to the outcome of a battle! The cards are very easy to understand. The tactics are not just in the cards, it involves you learning your opponent&amp;rsquo;s style, the way they are thinking, and trying to figure out their next move! While they do the same to you! Each card has defense/attack/body positioning and weapon flow represented in such a way that you could even imagine the actions you are performing as you play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     NOT a collectible card game. There are no perfect combos other than the ones your opponent didn't block. There are no super rare cards that will imbalance the game to those who can afford them. Every player has an equal chance to win, if they keep their wits about them, or get the opponent to lose theirs.&amp;#10;     Status cards that can increase your chance of victory, but not to the degree that a peasant cannot still best a king, if he plays his cards right. Anybody can win against anybody.&amp;#10;     Simple! Addition and subtraction rules; no tokens, no paper, no life counter, no phases, no arguing rules. The deck is all you need to play..... and an opponent. That will help a lot. You can practice with a single deck random solitaire if you want, but it is much more challenging with a thinking opponent.&amp;#10;     Tournament Play. They all have them, but not all of them will have the flavor of ours. You fight to gain status, from peasant, squire to knight, and so on. As you win you can fight well in higher status tournaments, and one day, maybe fight for the title of King! There are several characters that you can collect during the tournaments, and each of them can become royalty if you succeed!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a fighter learns he gets better, as they win they gain status in the society they live in. Each status upgrade gives the player an extra skill to survive battles at higher ranks. They can always fight higher ranks than they are, but they can expect to have more of a challenge. They can fight lesser ranks, but they will receive a lesser reward for fighting below their station. The skills fit the rank: a Squire learns to move quickly so gains a dodge. A Knight learns the use of armor for a time, etc. Status cards represent goals and bragging rights you can prove you earned, and skills learned from battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game includes the following expansions; &amp;#10;- French Rapier&amp;#10;- Two handed Scottish Claymore&amp;#10;- (Introducing) Japanese Katana&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
