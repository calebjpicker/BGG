						               													<description>Resisting Revolution is a sequel expansion to Volko Ruhnke &amp;amp; Jeff Grossman&amp;rsquo;s Cuba Libre, covering the period from the rebel victory in 1959 through to the climactic showdown with the US in 1962. During this time the new regime became increasingly alienated from the US, began to grow closer to the Soviet Union, and faced internal dissent from several sectors of Cuban society. The main expansion game charts the processes and actors that shaped Cuba during this period of struggle, with four players controlling either the new revolutionary Government, US-backed attempts to destabilise and overthrow the government, the growing Soviet influence and eventually military presence on the island, or the urban and rural Resistance to the revolution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Highlights include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     An entirely new four-player COIN game, Resisting Revolution, that tells the story of the consolidation of Castro&amp;rsquo;s government from 1959 to 1962.&amp;#10;     New mechanics for Government and Resistance Leaders, US and Soviet Escalation, US Intel and Soviet Materiel, and Regional Alignment towards Castro&amp;rsquo;s regime.&amp;#10;     A miniature two-player game, Days of Pigs, that explores hypothetical variants of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. &amp;#10;     Sixteen new Event cards for the original Cuba Libre game, drawing on research published since the game was released and covering certain topics in more depth, such as women&amp;rsquo;s role in the revolution, the urban wings of M-26-7 and other anti-government organisations, and the tools of repression used by Batista&amp;rsquo;s government.&amp;#10;     A new three-player variant scenario for Cuba Libre that approaches the revolution with a slightly different framing, and also allows for a shorter game with a reduced player-count.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
