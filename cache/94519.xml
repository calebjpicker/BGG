						               													<description>Object Of The Game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is for a player, or partners, to be the first to complete the four corners of a square of any size with pegs of his own color. Such a square is called a King-Square. The first player, or partners, to complete five such King-Squares have won the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Instructions For Two Players:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Opposing players use different sets of colored pegs. Players take turns alternately in playing a peg in any unoccupied position of the playing field. They continue to do so until one player has completed a the four corners of a square with pegs of his own color. As soon as a King-Square has been made the successful player records the square on his score board. All the pegs are then removed from the playing field and the loser starts play to build another King-Square. This process is repeated after each square is completed until one player has build five such squares with pegs of his own color. The first player to to do so has won the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Building King-Square&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to complete the four corners of a square with pegs of his own color has a King-Square. It makes no difference how many pegs of his own color, or of his opponent, are inside this square - or on the sides of the square - or in between his pegs on the four corners of the square - all that matters is that all the pegs on the four corners of the square are pegs of his own color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Squares made at an angle do not count. A King-Square must be parallel to the sides of the playing field and the rows and columns of holes. A square must be made up of four sides of equal length. A square is a figure having four equal sides and four right angles. A rectangle is not a square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Partnership play - four players&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As in Bridge, four players can play as two pairs of partners, each pair sitting opposite each other. Each pair uses pegs of the same color, dividing the pegs between them at the start of the game. All four players take turns alternately in placing their pegs, going clockwise around the table. As soon as a King-Square has been made it is recorded and a new square is started. As with two players, the game is won by the partners who are first to complete five King-Squares.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
