						               													<description>The conflict between the gods has caused the creatures to be lost in another dimension, so the players have to attract them and form the most powerful pyramid. We will have to acquire the different types of creatures, magic, water, fire and plant that will help us achieve victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Land of Gods, players will have the objective of forming the most powerful pyramid, as God you will have to attract creatures to your lands and combat them in the best possible way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We will draw four environment cards that will become part of the objectives of the game and we will deal three cards to each player that will be taken to their hand and with the rest of the cards we make two equal decks with the creatures face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The turn of both players will be played at the same time, having to put into play a creature face down that will become part of the individual pyramid of each one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The creature played will then be revealed and the type of the creature will be compared: The highest type on the reference card will win the trick. In the example, the water type card wins, since it is above the fire type on the scale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner of the trick will be the first to choose a visible creature from the two draw decks, the other player must take the other deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In turn, each type of creature has an ability when played that can trigger different direct and optional effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every time a turn ends we will check if someone completes an environment and at that moment they can claim it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is how the turns will go by, in which we will have to take into account the rules for placing the pyramid and also what the creatures themselves demand of us in order to activate their power-ups. In the conditions and enhancers, having a number of different creatures, adjacency of some specific type, that there are no fire creatures in our pyramid... the God that best combines his creatures and scores the most points, will be the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
