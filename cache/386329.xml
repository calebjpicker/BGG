						               													<description>Test your knowledge on the world of animals as you race through the Wild Webs! Play cards that describe the animals to move forward, and be the first one to reach your tent to win!&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Wild Webs, players are working with a hand of 3 cards to select 2 cards containing attributes of the animal in the next path space. Since that is not easy, players are allowed to take and use the top card (only) of other players&amp;rsquo; discard piles to use instead. Players try to avoid leaving helpful cards on top after their turn. Usually a space only has 1 or 2 forward path links, so it is not always easy to advance along a direct path. The deck consists of 100 cards, with plenty of duplicates and some multiple options cards with 2 different attributes listed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is marketed as an educational game that is a fun way to reinforce knowledge of animals and the &amp;ldquo;game builds observation, strategizing, memory, decision making &amp;amp; process planning skills.&amp;rdquo; Those are present, but to a limited degree since the design is intended to allow players as young as 6, and the complexity of game play is low.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
