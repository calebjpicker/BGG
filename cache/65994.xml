						               													<description>Translated from publisher website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sudoku Color is both familiar and innovative. This unique Sudoku can be played solitaire or as a family game for up to 4 people, each with his/her own gameboard. Due to the handicap system kids could beat their parents. Furthermore each game can be played with numbers aswell as colors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additional info:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the normal game, each of the players get his/her own sudoku board. A card showing an initial setup is drawn. All players start with the same setup by placing tokens (numbers or colors) on their own boards as shown on the setup card. Next, each player tries to finish his own sudoku as quickly as possible. The fastest player of the first round has to play the next round with the highest handicap, the slowest player with the lowest handicap. The different handicap levels are shown on the setup cards. Winner is the player that manages to be the first to complete his/her own sudoku board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then there's the Sudoku Sandokan type of play. In this variant, all players play on the same board. The goal is to get the board as full as possible. At first an initial setup is made based on what's shown on a setup card that is randomly drawn. The remaining tokens are then divided between the players. Each turn has to timed, so that each players has to place one or two of his tokens on a correct position on the board within half a minute. Failing to place a token correctly within the allotted time means that the player has to discard one of his tokens. A player scores a single point upon completing a single row, column or block. Completing two items (row+column, row+block or column+block) with a single token gives 2 points. Completing all three (row+column+block) with a single tile scores 3 points. The player with the most points wins the game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;4 boards&amp;#10;324 double-sided pieces with colors and numbers&amp;#10;50 cards with 100 startup situations (at 4 different levels)&amp;#10;Rules (in 6 languages)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
