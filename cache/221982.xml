						               													<description>Animagicians is a fast and fun card game of battles and bluffing where each player represents a Dark Seeker, magicians with the ability of cage the souls of the monsters into crystal shards, gathering more and more power in order to become the most powerful Dark Seeker ever seen. Travel to the Manor on the Forgotten Hill, where rumors says that a powerful Lich hides, cage its Soul, steal its Relics and face your friends in this fantastic game for 1-6 players!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has an unique way to play. The players start the game with 5 Magic Cards, and when the turn begins monsters will appear in front of each player, but instead of facing the player that is in front of them, monsters will chase the player they are pointing at!&amp;#10;Then, players will have to choose secretly which monster or monsters they want to defeat, setting spells on the board face down, to prevent being chased when the magic Spells are cast. No one can see those Spells until the moment of revealing them, so if the monsters have changed between turns, the players will have to remember what they have prepared and if they need to prepare more Spells to defeat the Monsters.&amp;#10;During the game you can find Relics, powerful items that you can hold to gain more power. You can also use Special Cards, changing the state of the game by adding Monsters, removing Monsters, changing Monsters or drawing more Spells.&amp;#10;The game will end when a player defeats a Lich with one of its Special Relics (which have to be stolen from the Lich itself) or when a player gets 10 Souls (which are given by defeating monsters), whatever happens first. If there is a tie when winnng, the tied player which has its turn closest to the Starting Player Token wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Animagicians we have three playing modes for all kind of players:&amp;#10;- The all vs all mode, where each player wants to get all Souls before each other, facing the monsters, tricking the other players and casting a lot of magic Spells.&amp;#10;- The Solo Player Mode, where a trio of brave magicians has entered the manor with 3 Soul Cages to encage the Soul of the Lich.&amp;#10;- The Co-op Mode, a challenging adventure for 2 players, where those players have to accomplish several missions inside the manor in order to encage the Soul of the Lich.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will also find ten unique Character Cards with its own backstory which explains why are they travelling to the manor, each of them with its own special powers (one locked and one unlocked) which makes each game different.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Do you still dare to face the Lich?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The contents of the Core Box of Animagicians are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 Rulebook (both in English and Spanish)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;149 Cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- 15 Characters (2 sides, one side in English and the other in Spanish)&amp;#10;- 6 Glossary of Symbols (2 sides, one side in English and the other in Spanish)&amp;#10;- 42 Spells&amp;#10;- 20 Special Cards&amp;#10;- 34 Monsters&amp;#10;- 12 Relics&amp;#10;- 4 Special Monsters (the Lich!)&amp;#10;- 3 Special Relics&amp;#10;- 2 Empty Rooms&amp;#10;- 11 Missions (for the Solo Player Mode and the Co-op Mode)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 Cardboard with:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- 3 Soul Cage Token (with Broken Soul Cage Tokens on the other side)&amp;#10;- 25 Soul Tokens (2 sides, one side with a Level 1 Soul and the other with a Level 3 Soul)&amp;#10;- 1 Starting Player Token&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
