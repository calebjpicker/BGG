						               													<description>Droggn is a three-player trick-taking card game played with an unusually-long Tarock deck containing 66 cards (easily created by removing some cards from a standard Tarot deck). Its main rules are mostly the same as in any other Tarock game, but there are a few rules that make it distinct: buying a card (see below) and rules for the Fool, which works like the French Tarot Excuse rather than its usual Tarock function of the highest trump.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All but 3 cards are dealt out, these last three forming a talon. Then, the players have a single round of bidding to determine who will be the declarer in this round. The declarer always plays against the other two players, who form a temporary partnership. The possible bids are to take the talon and buy a card (exchange a card from the declarer's hand for any other card he calls for), take the talon without buying a card, or not take the talon at all. There is also an ultimate bid where the declarer binds himself to take all tricks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a card has been bought and an exchange with the talon has been made by the declarer (if any of these were a part of the highest bid), eldest leads a card to first trick. As usual in Tarock, players are obliged to follow suit and trump if they cannot. To win a normal bid, a player must take at least half of the card-points - an expection is the bid where all tricks have to be taken.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a deal has been scored (loser(s) paying an amount of points based on the bid and the number of card-points taken by the declarer to the winner(s)), the declarer becomes the dealer for the next round. As the dealer always bids last, the player who was the declarer last round will have to bid high to play again in the following one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a detailed description and rules of the game, see a link to Pagat.com below.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
