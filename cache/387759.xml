						               													<description>The unique hand management and dice interactions in this game replicate all aspects of the Canadian Football experience - from kickoffs to passes, running plays to quarterback sacks, punts to field goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's everything you need to have a gridiron battle on your table without being overly complicated or convoluted. The turns are fast and furious, and the action is never-ending! Well, until the game's over that is... but you can always do a double-header!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each card in the deck contaians an offensive AND a defensive play, each with modifiers to the dice to optimize your chances of successful plays. Use your wits and strategize to maximize your options! Dice rolls and card modifiers determine the success of offensive plays and yardage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;AND! There are 2 ways to play: A quick game runs through the deck once, and the high score at the end wins! Quickies take about half an hour. A regular game runs through the deck twice - the first time through the deck gets you to half time, and then you reshuffle and play out the second half. After an hour you will have an ultimate gridiron victory!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
