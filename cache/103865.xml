						               													<description>In In Deutschland unterwegs players use an electronic tiptoi pen (not included) to travel through the German landscape and visit as many of the predetermined locations as possible. Each player has different locations to visit, but they share vehicles &amp;ndash; and going faster won't necessarily be better. By answering questions about the geography of Germany, players can earn extra points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played on a board that shows a map of Germany, with several cities connected by roads. At the beginning of the game, each player receives six destination cards. Two car pawns are placed at the start location at the center of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, the players take turns moving one of the cars one space along one of the roads. If a player moves a car onto a city, a player who has the matching destination card may play it. If the destination card is played, the player whose turn it is gets to answer a question asked by the tiptoi pen. If he answers correctly, he gains one point; if he answers incorrectly, his left neighbor gets a chance to answer the question correctly for one point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next to cities, a car can also end on an intermediate space, which may have a special meaning:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Swift ride: The player gets to take another turn.&amp;#10;    Question: The player gets to answer a question from the tiptoi pen for a point.&amp;#10;    Joker: The player gets to play one of his destination cards, as if the corresponding city has just been visited (which also triggers a question from the pen).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player has played all his destination cards; that player scores one point. A final question follows which allows all players to score additional points. Then, each player adds the number of destination cards played to his points. The player with the highest total score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
