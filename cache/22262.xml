						               													<description>Chemplay is a simulation game developed by Esso Chemicals in Europe to teach employees how to handle the &amp;quot;economic and business concepts of the petrochemical industry.&amp;quot; The goal of the game is to do business and not be eliminated by going bankrupt in a mechanism very similar to Monopoly. There are two types of roles for the players, either Chemical Companies or Merchant Bankers (with about one third of the players being Merchant Bankers). All players rolls two six sided dice and move their marker along the track that many steps, paying rent to the owner or buying the property if it is not owned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Merchant Bankers usually acts as bankers and loan money to the Chemicals Companies, at terms that are up to the players to negotiate, but can own some properties (Pipelines and Transport Companies). The Chemical Companies can own Chemical Plants, of which there are six types, including the special &amp;quot;Steam Crackers&amp;quot; that enhance the other plants, but not Transport Companies and Pipelines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any player can take loans from the game's bank, the International Bank, when buying properties or developing a property but only up to 50 % of the needed amount and always at 20 % interest. If any player needs more money or there is a need for money when the player have to pay for the rent of a property, a board meeting requires money or the taxes are due, then that player may negotiate a loan with any of the Merchant Bankers (up to 80 % of the required sum, but at any interest rate and terms the players agree upon).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Apart from properties the game board consists of Board Meetings (when the player might gain or loose money), taxation and income.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player cannot pay, not even by selling property to some other player or by taking a loan, then that player becomes bankrupt and a special meeting is held among the creditors. The purpose of this meeting is to strike a deal where each creditor gains as much as possible and at the same time the bankruptcy is prevented. If such an agreement cannot be reached, the player is bankrupt and is eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
