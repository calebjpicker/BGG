						               													<description>West of Souls is innovative solo or cooperative fantasy adventure for 1-6 players. Enter the world of Eloria, plagued by darkness and monsters of a vitriolic nature. You and your party will explore and make decisions that directly affect the world&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and future. The vastly branching storylines and numerous NPCs found in West of Souls ensure unique game play and future replay ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Enemy encounters and agonizing choices abound in this game and even the simplest of decisions may alter the world as you know it. Players will take up the mantle of an unlikely hero who, through motives of their own, have decided to stop Eloria&amp;rsquo;s impending doom. Be it gold, valor, or a deep empathy for the world around them, the players must work together to gain victory over scenarios and continue on their journey.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As players progress through the ever-changing world, they will develop their abilities, gain increasingly effective gear, and unlock additional skills specific to their character. Following each completed scenario, player choices will determine the future direction of the party&amp;rsquo;s quest, guaranteeing player involvement in the development of their own story. &amp;#10; The game is split into scenarios that are comprised of an exploration and journey phase, and each turn is split into a time of day (morning, mid-day, dusk, night). In the journey phase of the game, characters with travel throughout the game map discovering locations, triggering events, battling monsters, interacting with the world, and talking with NPCs to gain information about their quest and Eloria&amp;rsquo;s tainted past. Action point-based turns are used within West of Souls. Each player will have a defined number of actions that may be completed on their turn (unless you have unlocked a skill or found some gear that says otherwise). Once enough information has been gathered and players are in the correct location, the exploration phase begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One unique aspect of West of Souls is that the exploration phase is a hybrid of non-linear narrative, card-based battle encounters, and dungeon crawling. In addition, all characters in play do not have to enter the same exploration together, allowing for multiple explorations to occur simultaneously. Within the exploration phase, players will be forced to make harrowing choices, complete skill checks, and defeat beast to move forward. Vital story elements, lore, and history will be revealed to the players as they progress through the game.  &amp;#10;While death is an option in West of Souls, a player is never permanently removed from the game. The main resources in this epic journey are time and stress. If your team does not accomplish their goal within the allotted time frame, Eloria is cast into ruin. Likewise, if the encounters prove too much for your party and your stress level reaches a breaking point, you will lose the game. Victory is achieved at the end of each scenario as players defeat enemies of increasing difficultly and complete the necessary tasks. &amp;#10; This flagship game from Sky Monster Games is an ambitious story telling odyssey that maximizes the use of battle mechanics in combination with non-linear storytelling and character customization.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
