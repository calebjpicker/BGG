						               													<description>A shadowy spire has arisen nearby and with it came evil shadow creatures that have been ravaging the countryside. As a great champion of the kingdom, your challenge is to travel the lands gathering weapons and allies with the goal of assaulting the spire and ridding the land of shadows forever.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Curse of the Shadow Spire is a solo game that can be played in about 30 minutes. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will play as one of four heroes of the realm. Each hero has different goals and route to victory. They will need to explore and locate three powerful relics to gain access to the shadow spire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn you will adventure and explore a new terrain hex. There you will uncover the mysteries of the realms. Visit locations such as Temples, Markets, and Catacombs. Endure events such as Traps, Curses, and Plages. Fight evil Shadows. And slay the Shadow Dragon to gain one of the three relics you will need to gain access to the Shadow Spire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the game progresses the Shadow Spire will gain strength. Once you have found all three relics and gained access to the spire you may assault it in an attempt to defeat the shadow forces guarding it and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will play as one of four heroes: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crusader: As the Crusader you will be recruiting an army of Knights to help you defeat the shadows of the spire. You will need to defeat shadows, and venture into dangerous catacombs to gain the precious gold that you need to buy Food for your troops and recruit additional Knights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wizard: you will be working with dwarven miners to gather the finest arcane crystals buried deep in the mountains.  These crystals power you spells but you will also need to kill shadows and venture into dangerous catacombs to gain gold that you need to to hire them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ranger: you will be summoning powerful beasts and scouring the forest and crafting the most perfect arrows to aid you on your quest to defeat the shadows of the spire. You will need to kill shadows and venture into dangerous catacombs to gain gold that you can use to recruit powerful allies and heal your wounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Priest: you will be destroying shadows and gathering their essence to use against them in your attempt to defeat the shadows of the spire. You will need to kill shadows and venture into dangerous catacombs to gain gold that you can use to recruit powerful allies and tithe for blessings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Multiplayer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As each hero plays differently, the game may be played by up to four players simultaneously. All heroes will work together to recover the relics but only the hero that defeats the spire will be honored as the grand champion of the realms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
