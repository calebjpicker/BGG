						               													<description>Grisleigh End&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Time: The 1930&amp;rsquo;s, the Golden Age of Mystery&amp;#10;The Place: Grisleigh End, ancestral seat of the Redmayne family.&amp;#10;The Goal: To inherit the vast wealth of the Redmaynes by collecting fragments of shredded wills naming you heir.&amp;#10;The Conflict: Opposition from other potential heirs, and the house called Grisleigh End.&amp;#10;The Game: A boxed boardgame developed by the Council of Creators as the first in a suite of interconnected mystery-themed games set in and around this misty manor in the Welsh borderlands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lord Redmayne, Baron of Grisleigh End, has passed without a clear line of inheritance.  Having no children of his own issue, any claim to his rather sizable fortune must issue from his legal will.  Unfortunately the Baron not only wrote many different wills in the last years of his life, it seems he tore them all to shreds.  The six known claimants have been given twelve hours to prove their rights to inherit.  As one of these claimants, you must search the Baron&amp;rsquo;s country manor to find fragments of the will which name you as heir.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Would that it were only that simple.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The other potential heirs are collecting their claims as well, and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to stop them from picking up your fragments to keep you from having them.  Some might even stoop so low as to steal claims you&amp;rsquo;ve already gathered!  Keep in mind that opportunities also exist for collaboration, however, and that a winning strategy often includes working with your opponents when the time is right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As if the competing heirs weren&amp;rsquo;t enough to complicate your efforts, the End itself is an ode to the many peculiarities of the Redmayne family.  An ancient structure, expanded and updated haphazardly many times over the centuries, even the oldest members of the staff know only a portion of its secrets.  These individuals are key to your success, providing invaluable aid not merely in collecting your claims but also in successfully traversing the dangers of the house which may at times seem an implacable opponent.  For as you race from room to room, the house itself will interfere with your movement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Grisleigh End is also a tribute to the mystery fiction and the authors who have entertained generations of readers.  The artwork references hundreds of golden age mystery novels and short stories, from The Abbey Grange by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to The Zero Clue by Rex Stout, and dozens of mystery authors represented, from Margery Allingham to Israel Zangwill.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
