						               													<description>The last days of the Third Age of Middle-earth may have been dominated by the many great battles fought during the climactic War of the Ring, yet the most seismic event of all was the destruction of the One Ring and the final defeat of the Dark Lord Sauron. Crucial to this lasting victory over the forces of darkness was the epic journey undertaken by the Nine Walkers &amp;ndash; the Fellowship of the Ring &amp;ndash; for the deeds of its members, both good and ill, were destined to rule the fate of all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This expansion for the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game brings the fateful quest of the Fellowship of the Ring to life. As well as background on where the Fellowship&amp;rsquo;s journey took them and vivid descriptions of the the many trials and tribulations they faced along the way, the book features a wealth of new rules, Scenarios and profiles. There are also rules for a linked, 28-scenario campaign that enables you to refight every key engagement involving the Fellowship and its members &amp;ndash; from the smallest skirmish to the largest battle &amp;ndash; with your collection of Citadel and Forge World miniatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inside this 128-page hardback supplement, you will find:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scenarios: 28 Narrative Scenarios, from the very start of Frodo's journey in Farmer Maggot's crop in the Shire, right through to the destruction of the One Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Journey of the Ringbearer: Rules for linking the Narrative Scenarios together into a flowing campaign, with each battle having an impact on others. These include rules to represent the length of the journey, your Heroes being injured (or even dying!), and recovering their strength between encounters with the enemy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Armies: Detailed army focuses, including the strengths, weaknesses and key models for five Armies: The Fellowship, Rangers of Ithilien, Wanderers in The Wild, The Black Riders and Cirith Ungol. Also includes two new profiles for the Rangers of Ithilien list, and two for the Wanders in the Wild list.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Legendary Legions: Rules for six new and updated Legendary Legions: The Breaking of the Fellowship, Rangers of Ithilien, Lurtz's Scouts, Depths of Moria, The Black Riders, and Cirith Ungol.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fantasy Fellowship: Guidelines for creating your own Fantasy Fellowship by assembling Heroes from across Middle-earth in a similar way to the actual Fellowship of the Ring, but accounting for numerous 'what ifs' that could have reasonably happened throughout Middle-earth's and The One Ring's history. Includes rules for selecting a Ringbearer, their Companion, and the rest of The Fellowship. Also provides a slightly revised Fantasy Fellowship campaign, consisting of 23 linked Scenarios. (Please note that you will need the War in Rohan and Gondor at War supplements to be able to play all the way through the scenarios featured in the Fantasy Fellowship campaign.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Weathertop Masterclass: An extended masterclass on how to best build and paint the Weathertop scenery piece, available on ForgeWorld.co.uk, which was a key location on Frodo's journey.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher's website&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
