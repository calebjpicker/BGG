						               													<description>The players board a submarine that goes to the bottom of the sea to find an old sunken city. Equipped with the information board and a sonar device, they make their way to the ocean floor. We can only win together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game the clue cards (that show coordinates relative to the start tile) are shuffled and each player receives one and places it face down in front of them.  One of the remaining clue cards is placed face up in the middle. This face up card indicates where the entrance to the lost city is. The player who was last at the sea begins. This player receives the sonar map, the start card and four red markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all players have first reached the spot on their clue cards and then the spot with the entrance to the lost city all players have won. If there are fewer than two sea tiles left in the pile, if the submarine was dealt more than six points of damage or if the submarine cannot move the players lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player takes the following three actions during a turn:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) Repair the submarine:&amp;#10;If the sub has a point or more damage, it can  be repaired. To do this, the player takes the topmost sea tile from one pile and take it out of the game. All the damage is repaired.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) Move the submarine:&amp;#10;The submarine can move onto an adjacent tile that has already been placed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And finally 3) Use the sonar device, which is the main mechanism of the game:&amp;#10;The player chooses one of the top sea tiles and announces where they would like to place it. The turn player closes their eyes and the other players prepare the box according to the instructions on the sea tile. With the help of wooden clips the lid is placed on top so that the player cannot look inside. The turn player opens their eyes and pull the bell at any speed and marks it on the sonar map with the red stones, which places are vacant in each row and are therefore safe for submarine passage. This action can be repeated using the hourglass scale. However, if this is zero, the player has to rely on the first time. The cover is removed and the sonar card is checked. For wrong markers the submarine receives points of damage. After the sonar task is completed the player can place the tile and it is the next player's turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
