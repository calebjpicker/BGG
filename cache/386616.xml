						               													<description>A collection of 3 word games to encourage fun and creativity in spelling. Working with guidelines for Key Stage 1 &amp;amp; 2 these games will help children develop spelling and word building skills, whilst maintaining the enjoyment of a card game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;100 letter cards&amp;#10;40 Bookworm cards&amp;#10;1 minute timer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;---&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The games are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Matilda's the Bookworm: With a hand of 7 cards, each player in their turn asks another player for a letter, who must give it to them if they have it, otherwise they draw a card. Then they spell a word from their hand or discard 3 cards, drawing to replace the cards. They get 1 bookworm card for a word of 3 letters, 2 cards for a word of 4 letters, and 3 cards for a word of 5 or more letters. The first player to have 10 or more bookworm cards wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Matilda's Wordgrid: Deal out cards to make a 4x4 grid. Players have 1 minute to write down all the words they can spell using the letters in the grid. The player with the most correct words gets 1 bookworm card. Repeat until a player has 5 bookworm cards and wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Matilda's Wordstock: One card is dealt to each of 5 columns on the table. From their hand of 10 cards, a player in their turn plays cards to a column to make a new word, using or covering previous cards, or discards 3 cards; cards used are replaced from the draw pile. Players get 1, 2, or 3 bookworm cards depending on the length of the word made; the first to 10 book worm cards wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
