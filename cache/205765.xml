						               													<description>Pocket Rivals Strategy Card Game first edition comes with two 9-card 'deck' teams: Monsters Vs Robots. The game is designed for 2 players and is friendly for ages 8 and up. The first player to reduce their opponent's team of 9 cards to a single card left on the playing field is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pocket Rivals Strategy Card Game playing field is a 3 x 6 grid with room for a single card within each grid space. The board is placed between the two players who face each other across the longest edges of the board. Each of the two players has 9 cards. Each card has stats for Power, Wits, Charm, &amp;amp; Speed arranged on the top, Left, Right, &amp;amp; bottom sides respectively. Each stat is printed with a value from 1 to 4.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting from a random arrangement of all 18 cards on the grid, players take turns removing one another's cards via a  'challenge' mechanism that compares stats on adjacent cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a given turn, players activate a single card from their team on the field. They may move that card (one space in a cardinal direction), challenge an adjacent card (removing it from the field), and use the unique 'talent' ability associated with their activated card. The player may do up to all three of these actions in a single turn in any order. Gameplay continues with the players alternating turns until one team has been reduced to a single card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each card features a single character.  The front of the card is Gallery Mode: full color art with the character name. The back of the card is Challenge Mode: single color gradient art, character talent, and a yellow rim containing a stat for each edge of the card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The story conceit behind the game is that each player is an Ace Tactician who has selected 9 Ally Champions from across a myriad of Pocket Dimensions to face off against 9 Rivals and a Rival Ace. First to force their foe's faction from the field finishes as First Place Ace!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
