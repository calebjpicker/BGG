						               													<description>Ride is an adrenaline-pumping card game inspired by the film of the same name released in September 2018. As the two protagonists of the film you will have to be able to get to the finish line safe and sound, only one of the players will win, but the collaboration to be able to reach the finish line at least alive will be essential!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play your cards wisely, help your ally in desperate moments hoping that he too will do the same with you, under penalty of a scorching defeat by the Dark Rider!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After preparing the decks, each player chooses a Rider (or one is assigned to them at random), taking the relative Card (if it is the first game, mount the appropriate characteristic clips on the card), the Rider marker to be placed on the first card of the Path.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are four different phases that follow each other in a precise order: Route phase, Dark Rider phase, Events phase and Rider phase.  The first essentially creates the path that the players will be required to tackle: in each Path phase, 4 cards are added in front of the leading rider and all those in the queue of the last rider will be eliminated.  If there are no tiles behind them, the first one will be eliminated and the rider on it will suffer a penalty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Dark Rider phase, on the other hand, the action passes into the hands of the mysterious antagonist who will act following the action diagram shown on his card depending on the result obtained by rolling the RIDE die. It should be noted that this disturbing element will not be present immediately in the game, but will appear the first time a Rider should pass on a Path card with his symbol.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Should the Dark Rider not be present, the Events phase will take care of complicating the players' life: here a card will be drawn from the relative deck and covered place on the Path.  It will be revealed, and activated, should a player end his turn on that specific card.  Note that there is nothing to prevent different Event cards from hitting the same route segment: in this case, all effects will be applied.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the last phase, the players can take turns taking action.  After drawing 4 cards (or less depending on certain situations) they will be forced to play one.  Therefore, according to a precise schedule they will have to: apply the indicated effect and advance by a number of Movement Points equal to, or lower than, those provided by the card.  Having determined the card on which you decide to end up, you will have to apply any reported effects, reveal and activate the Events and, if possible, fight against the other Riders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of the game will be to accumulate more points than the others and, not secondary, to stay alive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
