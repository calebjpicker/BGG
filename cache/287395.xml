						               													<description>The game Excelsior consists of 4 separate games:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Kreuz und quer (Criss-cross)&amp;#10;The players have to get their 8 numbered pawns from their starting spaces to their destination spaces of the same numbers at the opposite side of the game board.&amp;#10;Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Each die has two large different colored dots and 4 numbered sides&amp;#10;(1-4), each in one of the four colors. Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results.&amp;#10;The pawns move forward according to the rolled numbers. The roll of a dot allows for a side-wards move. Instead of moving straight ahead, the pawns have to jump &amp;#10;diagonaly over oppenent pawns to a free space, whenever it is possible. If a pawn lands on a spot, already occupied by an opponent pawn, the later is eliminated from &amp;#10;the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Im Kreise hin und der (In circles back and forth)&amp;#10;The players use 4 pawns, which the have to move to space 50 of their color. Movement is determined by 4 special dice.&amp;#10;Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results. The roll of a number moves a pawn accordingly forward. The roll of a dot moves a pawn &amp;#10;sideways between the red and green tracks or between the blue and yellow tracks. If a pawn reaches space 44 on the neighboring track, it continues at space 1 of it's own &amp;#10;track for another round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Wer ist der Erste? (Who ist the first?)&amp;#10;Each player uses 1 pawn, which he has to move from space 1 to space 36 of it's own color. Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Results of one's own color allows &amp;#10;the pawn to move forward accordingly. Results of another color are deducted from the results of one's own color. The difference determines how much coins the player &amp;#10;gets from the cash box or has to pay into the cash box. The first player to reach space 36 wins the contents of the cash box. On spaces 12, 17, 24 and 34 positive &amp;#10;or negative points are multiplied.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. Wer ist der Letzte? (Who is the last?)&amp;#10;Each player uses 4 numbered pawns. Movement is determined by 4 special dice. Each roll counts for all players, according to the color of the results. First each player &amp;#10;has to get his pawns onto the spaces 1-4 of his color according to the number of each pawn, so when a green 4 is rolled, the green pawn 4 is put on the green space 4. &amp;#10;Only when all four pawns are on the board, they are allowed to move. A pawn occupying the center space may be thrown out by an opponent's pawn. If a player may move more &amp;#10;than one pawn the numbers must be used in ascending order. For each rolled number has to be uses by another pawn, so when 3 red numbers are rolled, three red pawns have &amp;#10;to be moved, if this is not possible the move is forfeit. If two dots of one are rolled, the player may return one of his pawns to its starting position (spaces 1-4), &amp;#10;as long as non of his pawns has reached space 12. The last player to occupy the center space wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
