						               													<description>After the initial success in &amp;ldquo;Day&amp;rdquo;, weeks of hard combats in Normandy had been fought. The region was ideal for the defense, with bocages, forests and rough land. The great allied advantages was the aerial supremacy and the great mobility of their units, had been almost annulled for closed combats far from the short and in difficult land.&amp;#10;The weather also did not help, with rain being a constant aspect of the campaign. Despite of this, the allies had kept the pressure and, with great difficulty, they had expanded the head-of-beach. The vital port of Cherbourg was conquered on 29/06/44, but the important city of Caen, entrance of the French plain was still in enemy hands.

Bradley, conceived the &amp;ldquo;Operation Snake&amp;rdquo;, aiming to break the front of Normandy.

General Montgomery, the commander ally, the British infantry that was depleted after weeks of constant combat. It had suffered the majority of the 40,000 decreases registered in 2&amp;ordm; British Army until July middle. It needed to attack, but he would have that to make it with its armored divisions. However, the land of Normandy was total inadequate to maneuver such mass of tank, not to be in the opened land more in the east of the head-of-beach, between Caen and Vimont. There, such action promised better chances. In function of this, the biggest operation of tank of the front occidental person was planned: the &amp;ldquo;Goodwood Operation&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
