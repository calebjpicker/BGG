						               													<description>This Kickstarter Exclusive brings a whole new way to play Marvel United, in the form of Campaigns! Each of these uses the full breadth of existing Marvel United components to recreate iconic story arcs from the comics! Players must battle through a series of 4 or 5 Games on average, facing events based on those comic storylines and living with the consequences of their actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Kickstarter Exclusive Campaign Decks set contains 8 different Campaigns, for a total of 114 cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Age of Apocalypse &amp;ndash; 7 Games (23 cards)&amp;#10;War of Kings &amp;ndash; 4 Games (16 cards)&amp;#10;Dark Phoenix Saga &amp;ndash; 6 Games (16 cards)&amp;#10;Avengers vs. X-Men &amp;ndash; 5 Games (17 cards)&amp;#10;X-Cutioner&amp;rsquo;s Song &amp;ndash; 4 Games (13 cards)&amp;#10;Age of Ultron &amp;ndash; 4 Games (8 cards)&amp;#10;Maximum Carnage &amp;ndash; 3 Games (8 cards)&amp;#10;World War Hulk &amp;ndash; 4 Games (13 cards)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each campaign starts with a roster of Heroes that can be used in each game. As the campaign progresses, depending on what happens, new Heroes may be added to this roster while others are removed. New Heroes may even show up mid-game, depending on events!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each game, the Rules card indicates which Villain must be used, any mandatory Locations that must be in play, and any other special setup instructions. A few games will even require playing with certain Challenges or in different modes, like Team vs Team, Super Villain, or Clash of Heroes (one particular case even calls for a Commander Solo Mode game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The back of a game&amp;rsquo;s Rules card indicates any special rules that must be used in that game, as well as listing triggers for specific Event cards. These could be if the Villain accomplishes a specific task, if the Heroes defeat a specific Henchman, if a specific Hero is KO&amp;rsquo;d, or many others. There are also usually triggers for winning the game or losing it (and also how the game is lost). When these triggers take place, players reveal the indicated Event card and resolve it. These might introduce a whole new set of rules to the game being played, changing it to a lesser or greater degree, they might affect the Heroes in specific ways, or add consequences for future games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning the game, players then proceed to the next game in the campaign, oftentimes with special changes depending on how victory was achieved. However, losing the game does not necessarily mean the campaign is lost. Depending on how they lose, players may be able to tackle the same game again, with a special handicap or additional aid, or just proceed to the next game carrying a negative consequence. Defeated Heroes may be removed from the available roster, and eventually players may simply lose the campaign outright. If they manage to come through each adversity, unlocking special surprises along the way, players will emerge victorious at the end of richly thematic campaign!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from Kickstarter campaign&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
