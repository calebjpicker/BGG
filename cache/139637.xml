						               													<description>Zombie Shuffle is a game for 2 to 4 players that lasts about 5 to 10 minutes by Blaise Sewell and Feels Right Design. Just like in any zombie story the object of the game is to survive the zombie apocalypse. Before you begin, you set up the Zombie Cards in this nifty &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot; shape and pick your Survivor Card to represent you in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everyone is dealt 5 cards that are a random set of weapons, some of which offer a utility function, but ALL of them can be used to Attack Zombies and other Survivors.&amp;#10;Zombie Shuffle cycles between a Night Phase, where you must defeat incoming zombies, and a Day Phase that offers the opportunity to prepare for the next zombie attack. The game begins when the first zombie in the &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot; is flipped. Survivors must Attack the zombie with ANY 2 through 10 card corresponding with that zombie's suit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner keeps the Zombie card to track their number of kills. If a player does not lay down a card corresponding with that zombie's suit then they are considered Attacked and either lose equipped armor or become a zombie!Before the next zombie card is flipped, Survivors can use the Zombie Cure, Equip Armor (which protects from Attacks), Steal another Survivor's Weapons/Supplies or may instead decide to Attack another Survivor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just like Attacking a Zombie, the Attack Card must correspond with the Survivor you're Attacking. If a Survivor is a Zombie and loses one of these battles then they are Dead for the remainder of the game. The other Survivor gets to keep their card, again to track their number of kills, and scavenge the dead player's cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Day Phase ends when  everyone has had a chance to play a Utility or Attack Card and everyone has drawn enough cards to have 5 cards in their hand again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner is the Survivor with the most kills at the end of the game. This has been a quick rundown of the game play and there are a few more awesome quirks to Zombie Shuffle not listed above. (For example, each Survivor has a unique Melee Weapon that can give them a Power-Up when equipped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
