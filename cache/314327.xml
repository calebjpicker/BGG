						               													<description>SKIRMISH: 52C is a wargaming rules system that attempts to offer a unique experience each and every game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning strategies must be developed on the fly and against overwhelming odds.&amp;#10;The rules are designed to provide a similar level of comprehensiveness and clarity as rules systems meticulously crafted for competitive play. However, the balance of competitive rulesets does not exist within SKIRMISH: 52C.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Instead, players combat the harsh reflection of the potential realities of warfare. In the face of adversity, you must quite literally play the hand you are dealt and hope for better luck next game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Number of Players&amp;#10;SKIRMISH: 52C is optimized for play by one to two players. It is possible to accommodate additional players, although it is suggested that players divide control of a team&amp;rsquo;s models as opposed to introducing additional teams. In these situations, model counts greater than 8 per team are recommended. This document also includes a supplement to direct and improve the solo play experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setting&amp;#10;SKIRMISH: 52Chas been designed to reflect abstracted modern infantry combat on Earth. The ruleset can be used to simulate the battles of the 20th century and beyond. Scope: SKIRMISH: 52C is a skirmish-sized miniature wargame. Players assume the role of a squad leader, commanding 4-12 soldiers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dimension&amp;#10;The game plays in 2.5 dimensions. There is a degree of abstraction regarding line of sight and terrain features. This abstraction permits--but does not require--playing SKIRMISH: 52C using a two-dimensional surface such as a dry-erase board in combination with coins or similar tokens. This abstraction also provides flexibility in the three-dimension terrain features that can be implemented. For example, the height of terrain features do not need to be appropriately scaled to the soldier proxies used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scale &amp;amp; Units&amp;#10;The boundaries of combat operations are often much less than a square mile. 1 inch (25 mm) within the game world approximates 6 feet (2 meters) in the real world&amp;rdquo;. 25-32 mm miniatures or tokens are used as proxies for human soldiers. Terrain feature size and distances described in these rules may be scaled appropriately to accommodate alternate miniatures, terrain, or units of measurement. The primary unit of measurement used in this document is inches. Metric approximations are provided but are not exact conversions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Time&amp;#10;Each model&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;turn&amp;rdquo; occupies less than a minute of game world time. A game can typically be completed within one hour of real world time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
