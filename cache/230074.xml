						               													<description>A card game for 2-4+ players with a Tarzan theme. The game involves playing cards to complete the storyline for an adventure involving Tarzan.  The form of the adventure is described as a Tarzantra and has the form:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;My name is Tarzan, (Title)&amp;#10;I have great (Attribute)&amp;#10;And am skilled at (Ability)&amp;#10;I like to wrestle (Animal)&amp;#10;Me and my friend (Ally)&amp;#10;Journeyed to (Locale)&amp;#10;Where with (Object)&amp;#10;We executed a daring (Action) &amp;#10;And defeated the (Foe)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common deck.  The deck has 9 suits of 9 cards each: Title, Attribute, Ability, Animal, Ally, Locale, Object, Action, and Foe.  Players are dealt 5 cards each at the start of the game with the remaining cards being spread out face down in the middle of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In a sing-song fashion the leader says the first line of the Tarzantra.  The first player to his left gets to play a Title card from his hand if he has one.  If he does, then he keeps the card face up in front of him in his personal victory pile and he draws a face down card and puts it into his hand.  (He must also say the name of the card to complete the line of the poem)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If he does not have a Title card, he must look at one face down card on the table. He may keep it, or leave it and put a different face down card into his hand.  If he had to draw a card, the next player to his left gets a chance to play a Title card to complete the line. This continues until someone plays a Title card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once someone does, the leader speaks the second line of the Tarzantra. The player who played the Title card gets the first chance to finish the second line with an Attribute card. This continues line by line, until the full Tarzantra is completed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the Tarzantra is complete, the player to the leader&amp;rsquo;s right becomes the new leader and starts a new Tarzantra.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when 5 Tarzantras have been completed (or 3 for a short game, or 7 for a long game).  The player with the most cards in their victory pile at game end wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
