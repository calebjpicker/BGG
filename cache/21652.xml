						               													<description>&amp;quot;Quiet in the classroom!&amp;quot; You crouch in your desk, maybe the teacher will not notice that you threw your rubber and that you're now reading your comic-book, or that Annicka is just whispering something to Hasse and just imagine getting caught cheating at your next exam...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a game for ages 8 and up. The box contains a board, 1 teacher figurine, 6 pupil figurines, 1 die, 90 pupil cards, 20 teacher cards and 1 class book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once more trouble in the class room, the pupils are busy with everything but their lessons. The teacher is doing his uttermost best to prevent disturbances. Unannounced tests are the most unpleasant means for that. But also tell-tales and careerists are on the side of the teacher. Only those who don't get caught can win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For starters, every pupil gets a figurine and places it on a school bank of his choice on the board. The teacher places his figurine on the desk on the board. Teacher cards and pupil cards are shuffled in separate stacks. Every pupil gets 4 cards from the their stack. The teacher gets 4 cards from his stack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pupils get to play their cards before the teacher, they have to keep their card turned up side down. The teacher rolls the die after he has played his card. The die indicates how far the teacher can move in the class room. The pupil sitting next to the teacher has to show his card face up. Depending on the card this pupil gets minus point, a remark in the class book, or nothing at all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After this all pupils and the teacher place their played card on the discard stack and draw a new card from their stack..&amp;#10;A round ends when the teacher has to play the &amp;quot;end of the hour&amp;quot; card. The next player (clockwise) becomes teacher for the next round. The game comes to an end when every player has played the teacher role and the last teacher has played the &amp;quot;end of the hour&amp;quot; card. The winner of the game is the player with the fewest minus points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Despite the shared name and the similar-appearing artwork, this is not the same game as Vorsicht Lehrer!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
