						               													<description>Game introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Head to Head Soccer is a game played with cards and two dice.  A schematic board may be used as well.  Using the cards, players manipulate the position of the ball on the playing field and attempt to shoot at the opponent's goal.  Dice determine the outcome of shots, corner kicks, free kicks, and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;User summary:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Head to Head Soccer was designed to support in-person as well as postal play (play-by-mail).  The time noted here (30 - 40 minutes) assumes in-person play by experienced players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is presented as a schematic to visual play but need not be used as an actual play surface.  It is divided into the familiar zones of soccer with letter designations for the zones.  The game is played between two players who alternate taking turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players begin by drawing eight cards from a standard pack of French playing cards; three cards are revealed and five are held.  Cards may be played from the hand or from the tabled three.  Not all game actions require a card play, but played cards move to the discard.  Cards determine what types of passes, defensive plays, fouls, and shots may be attempted - the correct card must be available to make the desired move.  A series of tables enumerates which card values, or greater, must be played to attempt various moves in or from various zones.  Because some cards are visible to the opponent, some candidate plays also are known.  Each player's hidden cards, however, complicate planning and anticipating.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A few specific actions - for example, making a corner kick - are determined by die throw rather than cards.  This method prevents &amp;quot;certain&amp;quot; scoring in various situations, replacing a card play with an element of chance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Head to Head Soccer was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 69 - Nov 1980).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
