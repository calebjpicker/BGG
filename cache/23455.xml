						               													<description>A mysterious treasure of the Aruba Pirates is on the sea-bottom and may be claimed. Since a player cannot do this alone, friends must be called, i.e. collect four maps (cards) of the player's own sea inhabitant friend in four different colors. Whoever succeeds first wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player plays one of their four cards (maps) from their hand to the center of the table and compares it with the four maps which are already laid out on the table. The player may either take all maps matching the value of the player's map exactly or take all maps which add up to the number on the player's map. Maps which match the player's designated friend (sea inhabitant) and are of a missing color are added to the others displayed in front of him/her. The others are placed in the player's own discard pile. After all players have played their hand of four map cards, a new round begins. Maps in the center of the table remain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A few specially designed cards bring additional excitement to the game. For example, with the help of these cards one can snatch away maps of the other players laid out in front of them or take all maps which are laid out in the table center. One may replace the maps that were taken by equivalent maps from their own discard pile. Therefore it is recommended that the player collect some of their own friend maps of the color he/she has already laid out. It is important for the other players to note which colors are in each discard pile as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In a variant the progressing values of collected friend maps play a larger role.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Arubas Treasure game did very well with our younger play testers (ages six to ten years). Luck, easy arithmetic, and some memory are part of game play. The maps are beautifully illustrated and of good quality. Thus all in all a really beautiful game for families, more fun with 3 or 4 treasure seekers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beate and Hans Schmidt&amp;#10;(Translation done in Google, with a little help from Mary Prasad - some parts skipped due to being incomprehensible.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
