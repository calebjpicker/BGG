						               													<description>Rocket Fire: A Space Exploration Board Game&amp;#10;A competitive family &amp;quot;turns base&amp;quot; dice and card game, that includes resource cards, fuel cards, power cards, and chips. Use resource strategy management to maximize dice roll chances to score points. Gain enough rocket fuel to be the first to launch 6 rockets into outer space to win the game. &amp;#10;2 to 4 players.&amp;#10;In Rocket Fire, the goal is to become the first player with six or more rockets ready to launch into outer space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To complete this, players must use resource cards, point cards, fuel cards, and chips to collect their materials. Power cards can be used to fight back, and cubes can be collected to exchange for coveted rocket ships. With a great plan and skillful resource management, each roll of the die can be used with maximum efficiency.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fuel the Fire&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Undermine other players and give yourself explosive advantages with Power Cards. After resolving dice rolls and with enough chips, players can take control of the game using as many power cards in their hands as they can afford. Plays include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Booster: This allows you to change the roll number of a reserved card, helping you or harming another player.&amp;#10;Forced Trade in which players can swap any reserve card on the board with another reserve card, as long as it is either a point or resource card.&amp;#10;A Recall that causes all players to return chips of the color chosen by the player that plays a Chip Dump Power Card.&amp;#10;Power Shield Blocking a power card from another player on any turn.&amp;#10;Calling a # Freeze which allows players to prevent a roll from counting, as long as it lands on a number specified when the # Freeze Power Card is played.&amp;#10;Using a Reserve Dump to discard a point card of their choice from their reserve slots.&amp;#10;Allowing a &amp;infin; Chip that allows that player to choose a chip color and take a chip from that color&amp;rsquo;s chip bank.&amp;#10;Using Stolen Power Power Cards to take any power card that has been discarded into that player&amp;rsquo;s own hand.&amp;#10;To plan their competitive strategies, players have one of three available actions per turn:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reserve resource cards by keeping them on your own slots on the playboard.&amp;#10;Purchase a fuel card using the cost listed on the desired card.&amp;#10;Buy a power card using a chip of any color, then hold onto it until the perfect moment!&amp;#10;Still, everyone starts somewhere, and these actions can&amp;rsquo;t just be used right away. The first round differs as each players prepares their strategy and their hand with the resources available at the start of the game. However, for every round after the first, the gloves are off, and the scheming begins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eyes to the Skies&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Though creating setbacks for other players can be fun, don&amp;rsquo;t lose sight of your ultimate goal: becoming the innovator that sends six or more rockets into the endless web of space and discovering all of its secrets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
