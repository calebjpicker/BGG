						               													<description>The Second Kharkov Campaign is a pair of Pint Sized campaigns for the TooFatLardies rule set Chain of Command. These platoon level scenarios are perfectly usable for other rule sets and provided the necessary information to make adjustments.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first campaign covers the initial Soviet attack on German lines in May 12th of 1942. It follows the advance of the Soviet 38th Tank Brigade and the 226th Rifle Division in their attack on the German 294th Infantry Division which was blocking the main roads leading to the city of Kharkov. The campaign has seven scenarios and involves British Lend-Lease tanks. The entire campaign spans a single day of this battle where the Soviets made significant gains and in many cases broke the German lines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second campaign covers the German counterattack on May 13th of 1942. Having released the armored divisions that were being held in reserves, the German 3rd Panzer Division pushed up from Kharkov and cut through a number of Soviet units. This campaign has six separate scenarios and covers the time from the 13th to the 16th of May 1942. This campaign has scenarios that may be played out with the What A Tanker rule set as well due to their armor heavy nature.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The third campaign in this book is a What A Tanker Campaign. This allows the player to create a map based campaign to move their forces in a kriegspiel type manner until their forces make contact, then play out the scenario using the What A Tanker rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lastly, the book provides some sketches of other units and actions that can be used to create your own campaigns with. The maps are based on period maps from German and Soviet armies. Each scenario has a game map and a picture of the table that I used to game these out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The PDF comes out to 105 pages and includes a short history of the campaigns to provide the player with a background on the action that they are fighting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
