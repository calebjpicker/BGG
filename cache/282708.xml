						               													<description>Become a glider pilot - and start your journey into the aviation world! Gliders Racing is the world's first board game about gliding for both pilots and those who dream to be a pilot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Practice the racing tactics, understand the meteorology and atmospheric phenomena which drive your flight and win the Big Race.&amp;#10;Enjoy realistic maps and cockpit views.&amp;#10;Have great fun while improving your flying skills.&amp;#10;Invite other players and compete to be the best glider pilot!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How does actual gliding work?&amp;#10;Do you know how does all this actually work? A glider (sometimes also called a sailplane) is an aircraft, that while flying is continuously losing altitude, up until it is so low, that the glider must land. The glider will commence its flight by being launched into the air either by an powered towing aeroplane or a stationary, ground-based winch. In such a way, a glider acquires its starting altitude, and may begin to lose it, thus beginning the flight. The glider can regain the altitude it lost by using atmospheric thermal updrafts. By utilizing such atmospheric phenomena, the glider can not only remain airborne for hours, but also cover large distances &amp;ndash; gaining altitude in updrafts and losing it while traveling to another updraft. This is why it is crucial for the glider pilot to spend as much time as possible in updrafts, and as little time as possible in areas where are no updrafts. Such areas are called downdrafts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Basic Rules.&amp;#10;Up to 4 players can play the game. Each player begins the game at the home airfield (START point), at the altitude of 1,500 meters. The goal of the game if to get to the FINISH point, visiting in succession all of the checkpoints, designated 1, 2 3, 4. The route between the points is the player&amp;rsquo;s choice. You can take the most direct, straight-line route, but other, less direct routes may be easier and more efficient. Remember: you need to visit all points in succession: START, 1, 2, 3, 4, and finally FINISH.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flying throw the map you will loose the altitude which you can rebuild (under the cumulus cloud, ridge called on map sail or wave). Rebuild altitude takes a time, so in our game next player is moving at that time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During all flight you have to keep over minimum your altitude and avoid out of landing which means you have start your journey again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner is the one which will be first on finish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
