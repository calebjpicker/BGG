						               													<description>Urgent recruitment! Now that efficient space development has become possible, Japan has decided to support companies participating in space development. Please contact the ministry office for the company you want.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are the president of a space development company. Thousands of years after humans began to fly, humans finally made their way into space. Space development has accelerated at a stretch by creating stars in outer space and recovering resources from them, and it is now a major business of the entire industry. Stay on top of this big wave, outsmart your rivals, and win lots of resources!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mezame No Sora (&amp;#231;&amp;#155;&amp;#174;&amp;#232;&amp;#166;&amp;#154;&amp;#227;&amp;#130;&amp;#129;&amp;#227;&amp;#129;&amp;#174;&amp;#229;&amp;#174;&amp;#135;&amp;#229;&amp;#174;&amp;#153;) is a set collection game. Each turn, you play three out of four cards to move or turn your rocket, and pick up a card from the color of the planet you end up on (if the planet is still unexplored). At the start of your turn you discard down to four cards into your personal score pile. If you push someone out of the universe map, you get to steal cards from their score pile.&amp;#10;At the end of the game, each card is worth 1 point, with 1, 2 or 3 bonus points for the majority in the three available colors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, you have five cards in your hand, each of which corresponds to a specific movement of the rocket (for example, two squares forward). You are required to select the most suitable action from the limited options and operate your own rocket. At the end of each turn, each player's position becomes a star and acquires resources. The rocket will become more and more difficult to move because it will be an &amp;quot;out zone&amp;quot; where you will be penalized if you enter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can even crash your opponent by pushing them out of the field or to a position with a star! By doing so, you can steal resources from the opponent and get points, so it is often advantageous.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules Summary:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Use your hand to move the rockets in order. Since the number of cards you can use is small, let's move systematically. On the contrary, it is also possible to advance the game in an advantageous way by predicting the opponent's hand and action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the turn, explore the planet and win cards. This will be a means of transporting rockets as a hand. The effect obtained for each color of the reclamation area is fixed. Be aware of the cards you want and collect them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is an out zone where you cannot enter the planets and the outside of the cultivated planet. Let alone self-destruction, you need to be careful not to be dropped by the other party. If you drop your opponent, you can steal a lot of cards from your opponent, so let's aim aggressively.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The person with the most cards in the end wins! Bonus points will be given to the player with the highest number of cards for each color, so it may be the secret of victory not to give up until the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
