						               													<description>Destroy the Capital to Win &amp;#10;1943, during World War II. &amp;#10;Leading your army, you must capture opponent nation destroying the its Capital city. &amp;#10;Do not let the enemy come on over your city.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules&amp;#10;Each player plays with a pack of cards &amp;ldquo;Nation&amp;rdquo; (50 cards), made up by Vehicles, Cities, Fortuity etc.&amp;#10;The game consists of rounds in which one player attacks and another one defends. At each turn, the player draws a card (unless otherwise noted) and he can put at stake more cards or none of them. &amp;#10;Each player begins with the pack of cards on deck and only with the Capital card is disclosed and at stake.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 7 types of cards: Cities, Vehicles, Aircrafts, Soldiers, Tactics, Fortuity and Equipments:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cities: They are useful to produce troops and make them attack. Capital is the main town and if it is defeated, the game is lost. &amp;#10;Vehicles: They are battleship troops and they attack other terrestrial troops or, in the case of anti-aircraft, also aircrafts. &amp;#10;Aircrafts: They can attack and defend the terrestrial vehicles without suffering any damage (except for the anti-aircraft) or they can attack other aircrafts or, if there are no aircraft opponents (or antiaircraft), directly the cities.&amp;#10;Soldiers: They are pedestrian troops and they attack other pedestrian troops, or in the case of anti-aircraft, also aircrafts. They can be more powerful thanks to the equipment cards. &amp;#10;Tactics: These are special cards with specific powers and they expire in one round. &amp;#10;Fortuity: This card must be played in the right moment they are drawn and it damages the player himself. They expired in one round.&amp;#10;Equipments: These cards enhance the soldier cards. At most one equipment for each Soldier Card. They expire when its pertinent Soldier dies and they can&amp;rsquo;t be reallocated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
