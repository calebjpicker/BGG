						               													<description>The Enforcers adds more depth to the multiplayer mode and important new features for the solo mode. The Enforcers Expansion Pack is composed of three characters, ALINA IVANKOVA, TOM LEE and &amp;ldquo;RAVEN&amp;rdquo; KWIATKOWSKI, with their three miniatures and their corresponding cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Enforcers in multiplayer game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Enforcers are three special characters that players can recruit throughout the game, like we usually do with the Jobs cards. The peculiarity is that they are part of a common market and that there are only three, so, as you can imagine, they are characters with outstanding skills, who have a notable impact in each game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Enforcers, as we said, will also have their own miniature and move around the board like the thugs. Their power on the board, that is, their strength on the streets of Chicago, lies in the fact that they all have a passive skill that can be activated at specific moments in the game. In addition, and as with vehicles, they cannot be eliminated from the game: they have come to the city to stay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each of the Enforcers comes with two additional cards: their Enforcer card, like that of the rest of the Right Hands, where their muscle and influence points are printed, as well as their skill and the effect it has on the crime rate; and a second card, where on one side we find how the mini works on the board in multiplayer games, and on the other,the specific rules of that Enforcer in solo games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Enforcers in solo mode&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second important new feature of this Expansion Pack has to do with the solo mode of Scarface 1920. The solo mode is based on a two-player game in which the other player is controlled by an AI (artificial intelligence) that builds a deck of cards with their own deck building system. This artificial intelligence will carry out its activity in Chicago like a player, but it will demonstrate a resource and organizational capacity superior to ours, forcing us to optimize our gang to the maximum to be able to overcome it.&amp;#10;With this Expansion Pack, the rival gang in solo mode will have the invaluable help of an Enforcer, whose miniature will be used to determine where the power of the rival gang is in the map. In this mode, as we have said before, the Enforcers have a card where their skills are explained, which have a different impact on the game: in solo mode, Alina Ivankova, for example, is capable of extorting the rival in the reorganization phase depending on the number of jobs he has.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
