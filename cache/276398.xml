						               													<description>Skruuvi is a Finnish relative of Auction Whist (which is essentially Bridge without a dummy).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Like Bridge, it's a four player, partnership trick taking game. Players bid how many of the thirteen tricks their partnership can win (or, unlike Bridge, lose). Also, players can communication information about their hands through their bids (and, unlike Bridge, the cards they can exchange) with a system of conventions. Here are the main differences:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Players get to exchange cards with each other. There are two ways of playing Skruuvi depending on how players exchange cards: Kitty games and No-kitty games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- In a Kitty game, players receive 12 cards; the four undealt cards is the kitty. The highest bidder adds the kitty to their hand, then gives any four cards to their partner. The partner adds these cards to their hand, then gives one card to each of the other three players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- In a No-kitty game, players receive 13 cards. The highest bidder gives any four cards to their partner. The partner adds these cards to their hand, then returns any four cards back to the highest bidder.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Players optionally play several rounds of Bolshevik, where one player attempts to win or lose all 13 tricks (without a partner).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Players can bid misere, which is a bid of how many tricks a partnership will lose (without a trump suit).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     As mentioned, there is no dummy!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     As in Bridge, the lowest bid is to win 7 out of the 13 tricks. However, the lowest bid you can win the auction round is 11 tricks! (Or for misere bids, to lose 11 tricks!) In No-kitty games, the lowest bid is to win 12 out of the 13 tricks. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     A game of Skruuvi lasts 24 rounds. Each player plays with a different partner for 8 rounds each.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
