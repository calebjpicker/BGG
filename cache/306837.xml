						               													<description>The planet Arrakis, commonly known as Dune, is a barren wasteland. It's also the only place where spice can be found. This precious resource is essential for space travel and so every house in the known universe vies for control of Dune. The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has recently granted stewardship of Dune to house Atreides, angering the previous stewards: the corrupt house Harkonnen. But this stewardship is not intended as a reward for the noble Atreides. The Emperor secretly fears the popularity of Duke Leto Atreides in the Landsraad and the Harkonnen's unbridled ambition and hopes that his scheme will spark a war between these two powerful houses that will weaken them to the point that they no longer pose a threat to his position as Padishah Emperor...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this free Print &amp;amp; Play game, the players have been recruited by either house Atreides or house Harkonnen to fight for control of Dune. They each start with a base and a small personal deck of cards representing the units that make up their forces. These units can be sent to sectors to claim a spice income that allows a player to purchase or build more and better units for their deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a sector becomes too crowded, a battle will be fought there. The winner of this battle will permanently claim the sector. A claimed sector does not give income anymore, but it is worth a number of victory points. After claiming a set number of sector cards, the game ends and the player with the most victory points will be the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Units can also be used to attack the opponent's base. Units in your deck and discard pile will defend against attacks on your base. If you fail to defend your base, it will be damaged during attacks and you might eventually lose the game because your base is destroyed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
