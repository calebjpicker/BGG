						               													<description>Armoured Storm: The Eastern Front is a quick-playing, simple-to-learn game of tank-versus-tank combat in World War Two. The rules are intended for battles between 15 and 30 tanks per side, plus 4 or 5 HQ tanks. This means, in game terms, that each player will command one or more companies of tanks organized into several platoons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Armoured Storm, you take the role of a commander first and a gunner/driver second. Your ability to give the right orders at the right time and bring your available firepower to bear more efficiently than your opponent, are more important at the level of command you&amp;rsquo;re representing. Out-thinking your opponent by being clear about your goals and through clever use of the Tactics Chart will bring you success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE &amp;lsquo;YOU COMMAND&amp;rsquo; SERIES&amp;#10;&amp;lsquo;You Command&amp;rsquo; is a series of light wargames by Daniel Mersey. When you play a &amp;lsquo;You Command&amp;rsquo; game, your goal is to defeat your opponent by out-thinking them tactically using the innovative Tactics Chart, and then by out-fighting their model army on the tabletop battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please note that all Armoured Storm titles share the same basic rules; optional rules and tank stats are different according to the theatre of war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
