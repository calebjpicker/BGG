						               													<description>In this deck-building game, the team picks a mayor to support that starts at 50 on the Carbon Tracker, who must race against the timer playing piece on the Time Tracker. Each player starts with an identical deck of cards, and their turn is made up of three parts: Action, Recycle, Draw.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each turn, you can buy additional cards from a shared marketplace with the powers to create a more sustainable city. But, amongst the deck of cards you have snag cards, global cards and special power cards, all valued in cost and carbon that could speed or slow your path to victory. Balancing the need to generate income with reducing carbon, you can follow numerous paths to victory, but collaboration is key.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You'll need to bring together governments, industries, and the public. It&amp;rsquo;s a conversation making game, where you will have to discuss tactics with your teammates.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You win by getting the carbon level to 0 before you reach &amp;rsquo;Time&amp;rsquo;s Up&amp;rsquo; and run out of time. And if you can't bring carbon levels to zero before it's too late, everybody loses. The stakes couldn't be higher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can also be played competitively by each player taking a mayor to race down the carbon tracker, or solo by taking two draw decks to play from.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
