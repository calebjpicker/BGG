						               													<description>The Xenon Empire's Star Wars was one of the titles in Galaxy-Foundation Games' strategic Battle for Andromeda: Conflict for a Trillion Suns! series. The games in this series used a series rulebook which contained the production rules, ship information, movement and combat rules, etc., and a game-specific rulebook describing the scenario, units, and special rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This particular game covers a war between the Xenon Empire and the Federation of the Monad. From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim, but with some sections removed):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        STAR WARS OF THE XENON EMPIRE: Crusade against the Warlords. Connected to the Deliverance Game, this is also a game in itself. IT has the most unique feature, as every BFA game has a new feature incorporating a special principles from others. THIS IS THE ONLY GAME THAT CAN BE PLAYED SOLITAIRE in its fullest sense. Yet, it is designed for &amp;quot;LIVE&amp;quot; play with one or two additional players. Many Gamers not having partners often play by themselves, but  the Paper-Computer set-up to function alone or with two players allows unique and individual actions!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;        Xenon has a vital Colony off the board (on another map in another Game). This Colony may be struck by the Kons Dirak Ahm, the oppressive Empire of such huge size and tyrannical rule that all independent Cultures fear it. Only the numerous revolts needing reprisals and other Cultures being overrun have prevented the Xenon Cluster-Colonies from being brought to heel. Xenon needs to consolidate its own systems before attempting to aid their Colonies, yet their Vast Cluster System is surrounded by the War-Lords - small petty Groups that of themselves have little power, but nibble away at Xenon Zones. To wipe them  out is easy, but time-consuming.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;        [deleted for space]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;        The Monads, using the deadly Monadian &amp;quot;web&amp;quot;, a Plasma Body of sheer energy that drains and implodes ships and holds fleets in submission. The Xenon Vulcan Cannon and their &amp;quot;Harpoon&amp;quot; Missile Conglomerates (each one as big as Cuba or Florida!), and a variety of other weapons such as Diffusion Mines, Sabre Beams, Phasers, Photon Torpedoes, and even the Death Ray of Doom!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10; &amp;#10;&amp;#10;        The entire Xenon Fleet is enclosed, as well as the Monads' strange ships and the Warlord forces, but over 30 Tactical-Variant Cards, play aids, and Scenario Manual. No two games or Strategies can ever be alike! The 22x28-inch rigid Map-Board predominates in Brilliant Reds and &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; pinks - a startling appearance once observed by new players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
