						               													<description>You're survivors of the apocalypse. Whatever your survior guests bring to your diner, you should consider using in the kitchen! &amp;#10;Survival Kitchen is a cooperative card game with app support about taste, texture and poison management.&amp;#10;Each player contributes ingredients from their hand to the ordered dish, scanning the ingredient card with the device's front camera. It all goes into the cualdron. Compare your ingredients and tools. What can you offer to the kitchen? Can you, as a team, set the right amount of food, and give it the ordered texture. Will, you be able to play the right amounts of the 4 types of taste? Will you be able to cook your dish in just the right temperature to maximize taste? Cooking aint easy! Luckily, your guests will not be picky!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unfortunately, some ingredients are toxic. Your &amp;quot;survivors&amp;quot; won't survive your toxic recipes unless you act strategically and cook with caution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The app (for Android and iPhone devices) guides you through the story and the rules, so you don't even need to touch a rulebook!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Survival Kitchen includes two playing modes:&amp;#10;In roguelike mode, you face different situations, each with its own challenge. You unlock and find new cards and make your diner larger and more successful, or at least, don't let it go abandoned, for as long as possible.&amp;#10;There is also a quick game mode, that allows for a shorter play time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
