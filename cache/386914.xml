						               													<description>Stardate 49427.7&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: this is not a new Alliance game. It contains the same game materials as those in Alliance - Dominion War Campaign Part I. It is intended for people who already have the ships, and want to try Alliance, or to get additional copies to play with higher player counts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Year is 2371 and the Federation faces a new and very dangerous threat from the Gamma Quadrant. Much is still unknown about our aggressors: The Dominion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Star Trek: Alliance - Dominion War Campaign, is an exciting starship battle game set in the Star Trek universe! Now, players with existing collections of Star Trek: Attack Wing Ships can dive in at a lower price, or can pick up more copies to play with up to 6 players!  This special version of the first Dominion War Campaign box includes only the printed components and dice unique to Alliance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To play, you will also need a Star Trek Attack Wing Core Set, and the following ships: 1 Excelsior-class (Federation), 1 Akira-class (Federation) and 3 Jem&amp;rsquo;Hadar Attack Ships (Dominion).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Star Trek: Alliance, One or more players will create their own Federation captains, form a task force, and work together to defeat the Dominion over a series of campaign missions. This box contains everything one or two players need to play the full campaign, including pre-painted plastic ships, custom dice, cards, tokens, and a 6-mission campaign book. With multiple copies, up to six players can fight the Dominion together!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During each mission, players battle against enemy ships controlled by the game, while completing objectives to earn experience points. Between missions, players spend experience points to upgrade their ships and advance the overall campaign, building their captain into a Starfleet legend!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
