						               													<description>Villains threaten the city. Led by the notorious Green Goblin, they will surely crush all that is good and right. Spider-man has his work cut out for him-and it will take all his Spidey-speed to grab the Green Goblin(and all the cards) first!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Based on the popular game Slap Jack, this fast-paced card game will keep the Spidey-action flowing battle after battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;52 card deck includes an instruction card and 3 BONUS VILLAIN CARDS!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal is to win the Green Goblin and all the cards, by being first to slap each villain card as it is played to the center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Deal cards one at a time face down, to each player until all the cards have been dealt. The hands do not have to come out even. Without looking at any of the cards, each player squares up their hand into a neat pile in front of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beginning on the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left, each player lifts one card at a time from their pile and places it face up in the center of the table.&amp;#10;When the card played to the center is a villain card, the first player to slap their hand down on the villain takes it, as well as all the cards beneath it. The player winning these cards turns them face down, places them under their pile of cards, and shuffles them to form a new, larger pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When more than one player slaps at a villain, the one whose hand is directly on top of the jack wins the pile. If a player slaps at any card in the center that is not a villain, they must give one card, face down, to the player of that card. When a player has no more cards left, they remain in the game until the next villain is turned. The player may slap at the villain in an effort to get a new pile. If the player fails to win that next pile, they are out of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
