Using None, One or Both custom die for different types of game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are Seven Game Options on the game box and 'More' additional FREE game options which can be downloaded from the publisher's website. &amp;#10;Note: The additional game playing options were created after the game had been produced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game playing options include:&amp;#10;Pure Strategy, Chance, Quick, Solo, Team, Gambling (Fun or Real), Line Em Up 4 to 7, How Many (requires maths), Pass Over (no board), Exchange and more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Include Exchange into your game and you could Turn Back Time by exchanging opponents tiles for your own, and maybe obtain that lost five point hexagon or even instantly win the game..!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whichever option you choose to play:&amp;#10;Watch out for the Instant Win, Bonus Hexagon and Line Forming opportunities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Triagonal can accommodate 1 to 4 players Ages 5 and up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can play Triagonal almost anywhere because game pieces are located and retained in the board during play but, are instantly cleared ready for the next challenging game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All Triagonal components are injection molded:&amp;#10;Including the white triangular game board, 84 black Sector Formers, 120 Scoring Tiles (30 of each in red, yellow, blue and green).
