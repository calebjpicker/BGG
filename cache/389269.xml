In Lost &amp;amp; Found: Order in the Court &amp;ndash; the Party Game, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to think fast to create accurate and humorous scenarios in a quest to explain religious laws as they were written in medieval Fustat (Old Cairo).

Award points for the best story when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn in the judge&amp;rsquo;s seat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Order in the Court, a new game in the Lost &amp;amp; Found series, explores how a code of law called Mishneh Torah addresses lost and found possessions. Written in the 12th century by Maimonides, a great physician, philosopher, Jewish scholar, and sage, the law gives the basis for many interesting court cases. Try to figure out how they might have gotten to a court in the first place! Explore the ways in which this medieval religious legal system helped to hold society together by explaining rulings in the law. Why can&amp;rsquo;t three people simultaneously read from the same scroll? Why is your lost basket more important to return than your teacher&amp;rsquo;s? Tell your story with Lost &amp;amp; Found: Order in the Court &amp;ndash; the Party Game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
