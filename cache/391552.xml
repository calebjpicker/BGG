						               													<description>August 1863. Preparations begin for the Salon, the largest and most prestigious art exhibition in the world! The Louvre halls will be filled with paintings from floor to ceiling, and you will be one of those responsible for selecting the works.&amp;#10;The task is not easy: hundreds of works have been entered, and you will need to choose the best ones for the room you are curating.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To be successful, it is fundamental to identify which themes are most in vogue this year and to reject the very modern paintings, which have no place in a classic Fine Arts salon, but which may dictate the new directions of art in the future.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Salon, players bid on paintings with different styles and formats and then place them on their player boards according to the highlight they want to give the selected painting. Paintings not chosen are sent to the Hall of Rejects and may give bonuses to the player who places them there.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the game, players try to get medals for their paintings, make the themes of their interest more valuable and prepare for the next auctions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most victory points at the end of the game will be considered the best art curator in the Salon de Paris.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
