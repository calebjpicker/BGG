						               													<description>Special Delivery is a new and unique baby shower and family board game for the purpose of entertaining baby shower guests and to play at home to reinforce to young children that a new baby is coming into the family. After the game is played with the kids, the months of the trimesters can be crossed off the board as the months pass so that children will get an idea of when the baby will arrive!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This project is a fast moving, hilarious and exciting game for baby showers and couples and family game nights. The game takes an unlimited amount of baby shower guests through delightful scenes of the 3 trimesters of pregnancy as players move their cute minature pink and blue milk bottle tokens up the game board -- from the 1st trimester when the father starts sweating and yanking his collar loose when the doctor tells him he's going to be a daddy, to the 2nd trimester where the now obviously pregnant wife is instructing the bewildered husband to repaint the nursery, and to the 3rd trimester where the anxious mom on a gurney nearly chokes the daddy as she clutches his tie on the way to the delivery room -- while teams take turns trying to draw baby-related words and phrases from the cards in the card box on pink and blue scratchpads. As their teammates successfully guess the word or phrase being drawn, they advance their milk bottle tokens up the gameboard to the Special Deivery space to &amp;quot;deliver their baby.&amp;quot; Hilarious sketches and guesses encite non-stop laughter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
