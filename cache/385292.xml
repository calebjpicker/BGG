						               													<description>An intense game where players wage war over five arenas of war: land, sea, air, politics and espionage. Arenas are won by creating the strongest combinations of numbers, and completing each arena also unlocks a special power with a limited number of uses. The powers get exhausted as they're crossed off, incentivizing players to claim them before their opponent. Will you bid your time by spreading your numbers as thinly as possible, or concentrate your forces early to access superior special powers?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As both players always use the same dice rolls to generate their numbers, you cannot rely on luck to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is a PDF file that can be printed on one sheet of paper and played using one dice and a pencil. Rules are also on one page, so that you can print it with the rules on the back of the sheet. Files are provided for both A4 and Letter size, and it can even be printed in larger sizes such as A1. Players who don't wish to print can use a PNG image file provided to play online.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be played with two players, as a team game with up to 10 players or solo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
