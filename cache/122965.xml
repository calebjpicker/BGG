						               													<description>British card game, described as a game and a puzzle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any number of players from two upwards can play. The cards are dealt round in the usual manner, faces (pictures) downwards. The players must not look at the face side of their cards. The player left of dealer leads and turns his or her top card face up in the centre of the table. Each player plays a card in turn Each successive card should be quickly played so that a &amp;quot;body&amp;quot; is fitted to the &amp;quot;Head&amp;quot; on the last card played. The title line &amp;quot;Grandfather's Whiskers&amp;quot; on the back of each card indicates the half containing a &amp;quot;body.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lots of combinations of head and body will be created to the amusement of all the players, but when Grandfather's Head appears on Grandfather's Feet, players must call &amp;quot;Out&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;In&amp;quot;. This is because his whiskers might be under the eiderdown on the card or poking out from under the eiderdown. The first player to call correctly takes all the cards in the centre. If a wrong call is made, that player must give every other player a card from his hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective is to be the last player with all the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE SIX JIG-TYPE PUZZLES&amp;#10;The backs of the cards comprise six different jig-type puzzles. The cards numbered from 1 to 8 constitute a quite simple puzzle, for the picture is formed merely by placing the cards in a certain order with their edges touching. In the second puzzle group (numbers 9 to 16) the cards overlap.&amp;#10;The remaining groups, numbers 17-24, 25-32, 33-40 and 41-48, become successively more difficult. The last group (41-48) in which Grandfather and his Whiskers are depicted, is the most advanced puzzle of the whole series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
