						               													<description>In late 1686, Sir William Phipps convinced investors to fund an expedition to what is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic to find sunken treasure, despite the location of the shipwreck being based entirely on rumor and speculation. In January 1687, Phipps found the wreck of the Spanish galleon Nuestra Se&amp;ntilde;ora de la Concepci&amp;oacute;n off the coast of Santo Domingo. Some sources say they used an inverted container for the salvage operation while others say the crew was assisted by Indian divers in the shallow waters. The operation lasted from February to April 1687 during which time they salvaged jewels, some gold and 30 tons of silver which, at the time, was worth over &amp;pound;200,000.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Diving Bell takes the players on a journey to the bottom of the sea to find various treasures. But it is not a walk in the park to find them - various threats exist to stop the players from doing so. &amp;#10;Diving Bell is a cooperative game that players will use a unique way of choosing actions to get their ships ready for diving. A diving bell is also an option to help with the success of each dive they are used. Spatial thinking, action selection,  resource management, and other mechanisms are available for the players who wish to conquer the deep.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
