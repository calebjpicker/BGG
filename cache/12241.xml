						               													<description>Below is the description for &amp;quot;signal for close action&amp;quot; taken from the 2nd edition (1993). This are closely related to the later &amp;quot;Signal Close Action, Fast Play&amp;quot;, but trade complexity/depth for speed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Signal Close Action has been designed for sailing navy wargamers who require a set of rules which accurately reflect the era in which they are set. In the Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable. His possible courses of action were governed by the &amp;lsquo;technology&amp;rsquo; of the time, the wind, weather, ship&amp;rsquo;s condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships&amp;rsquo; companies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fundamental to the rules is the Ability Chart which requires only 1 throw of dice and governs the core game (except Weather) as well as other options. Note:&amp;#10;When for example &amp;lsquo;movement section&amp;rsquo; is referred to in the rules, this relates to the movement section of the Ability Chart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;---&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taken from the 4th edition (2005), is the description for &amp;quot;Signal Close Action&amp;quot; by Mr. Rod Langton.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;This new edition of Signal Close Action is very timely, this being the year of the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar.  It inspired me to produce, not just an update of previous editions, but an enhanced game, smoother, with more fluid movement and ability for vessels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Signal Close Action was designed for sailing navy wargamers who require a set of rules which accurately reflect the era in which they are set.  In Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable.  His possible courses of action were governed by the 'technology' of the time, the win, weather, ship's condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships' companies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For those who re very new to Napoleonic naval wargaming, you might find my Fast Play set a good introduction.  Even after you progress to a full comprehensive game, your Fast Play will still be very useful for club games and introducing others to the hobby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Experienced Signal Close Action players will want to know 'what's new' in Fourth Edition.  Well, the concept of the Ability Chart is still fundamental to the rules - particularly as it cuts down on the need for excessive record keeping.  This time however, there are more dice and they play critical roles.  In the past, if you had a 'bad [dice] throw' then ll your actions were affected.  With Fourth Edition, the dice are color coded, with one being 'common' to all.  The score of this Common dice [die] is added to the dice [die] relating to the various actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other new innovations include the division of a player's part of Turn into two segments and reloading, so that the time scale of actions are more realistic.  The actual Firing rules are not changed noticeably but there are new separate charts for firing at unrated vessels.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
