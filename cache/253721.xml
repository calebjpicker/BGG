						               													<description>Infinite Evil is a sci-fi RPG miniatures board game for 1-4 players in development by Intfury games studio.&amp;#10;Several mutually hostile groups are locked on a transport spaceship with a broken main engine. The game features 4 squads. Each squad has its own goal. The game ends by accomplishing this goal or by destroying all other players.&amp;#10;There are 9 characters in a squad. A player loses if all his characters die or another player completes his goal. Basically players move in turns, trying to take a profitable position and not to give another player to go to the key mission elements that he was unable to achieve his goal. By completing missions, a player acquires money, resources and new battle cards. A battle takes place if players are near, within one cell.&amp;#10;A player can accumulate 30 cards in the deck, but he can use only 10 in a battle. A battle consists of 1 round. All battle cards have a description of the action. Players count the number of points (written on the cards) at the end of the round. Who have more points - the winner. But you need to take into account the ability of the cards, if any. Card abilities are diverse: plus to protect, to attack, and so on. The winner gets money or a new card. The loser loses the character who participated in the battle.&amp;#10;Cards: &amp;#10;Special cards has description of their action and no points. &amp;#10;Special cards are very powerful. One card can cause damage to 3 cards or, for example, to revive your squad. &amp;#10;Battle cards has description of their action and there are points on them. Battle cards places to battlefield board which divided in three rows (for each player).&amp;#10;The characters are divided into 3 groups. Each group placed in a row.&amp;#10;1st row - melee group.&amp;#10;2nd row - middle range group.&amp;#10;3rd row - long range group.&amp;#10;Each row corresponds to the icon: melee, medium range, long range. A card can be placed to the correct type of row only.&amp;#10;A melee character can only be placed in a melee row and attacks enemy's cards in a 1st row. Also melee group can add points for your group in another row.&amp;#10;Middle range character can be placed in a middle range row only. Middle range group can attack enemy's cards in 1st and 2nd rows.&amp;#10;Long range character can be placed in a long range row only and attacks enemy's cards in all three rows. Points are counted at the end of the battle.&amp;#10;Release of the game is scheduled for February 2019.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
