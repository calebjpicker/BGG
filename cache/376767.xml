						               													<description>MoonArk is a brand new 'In-hand' tactical card game from Abandoned lighthouse Games...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alert! Alert! impact is imminent! As air support for the Anti-Extinction Squad, It's your job to help the ground team rescue the last few stranded animals before a giant asteroid strikes the planet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With good tactical decisions, great memory and little bit of luck, you must work your way through a deck of beautifully illustrated tarot sized cards, matching animals with their own specific Containment Pods and airlifting them to safety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two fire cards that you pull out of the deck. Shuffle the deck, hold it in your hand with the faces down, then put those fire cards at the back. Flip over the top card and see what it is. This is your view from your vehicle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sometimes you will find an animal. It will be an herbivore or a carnivore. Each animal is assigned a rescue pod number, and a displacement number. If the animals rescue pod is nowhere to be seen in the deck near this animal, then you must use the displacement number to push the animal backwards in the deck. But be careful that you don't put her before is in front of carnivores or they will be eaten and discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you find a rescue pod, you can remove it from the top of the deck and blindly place it anywhere in the deck. This is where some of the memory aspect comes in. You're hoping to get that pod next to its matching animal. And you don't want either of them to end up between the two fire cards which are slowly moving towards the front of the deck, or you will lose them to the fire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Occasionally you will find a poacher. You have to move them back into the deck, hoping that you get them between the fire cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every time you are able to manipulate the cards so that a carnivore is in front of its matching pod, or an herbivore is behind its matching pod, as those two cards make their way to the front of the deck, you get to remove both cards from the deck because you have saved that animal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the fire cards have made their way to the front of the deck, look to see what's been lost between them, and then move that whole batch of cards to the back of the deck again. Keep going, moving cards around in the deck, until there isn't anything else left that you can do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Save as many animals as you can, and if you haven't saved them all, try to do better during your next play!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
