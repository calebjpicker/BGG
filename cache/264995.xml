						               													<description>GROK-or-GUMP contains 3 games in 1.  All 3 games use a special dual-suited 30 card deck called a GROK Deck.  Each card has a Major Suit and a Minor Suit.  There are 3 Major suits (each with 10 cards) and 5 Minor suits in the deck (each with 6 cards).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 3 games included are each distinctly different from each other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GROK: A trick-taking with escalating bids in which 1 player takes on all other players.  Players bid on the number of cards of either Major or Minor suits they will capture during the round.  A player wins the bid points if they are successful; however, if a player obtains a result that is better than the highest bid at the start of the round, all other players score points per that result.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GUMP: A hand-elimination game in which players attempt to be the first player to play all of their cards - or - be the player with the least cards in hand when the round ends.  This game makes use of 18 supplemental GROK Rule cards that specify how cards must be played.  If a player is unable to play according to the rule, they add all played cards to their hand and flip up a new rule.  The game ends when a player plays their last card or if all 18 rules have been used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GROK-or-GUMP: A pattern-recognition and social deduction style game.  This game uses a small number of GROK Rule cards and a hand of 5 cards.  Prior to starting the round, all players secretly decide if they will follow 1 of the face up rule cards or follow none of them.  Once all players have decided which way they will play, players each play 1 card down in front of themselves.  Players may then choose to place a bet on any player as to which way they are playing.  Play continues until all 5 cards are played.  Players score points based on when and if the other players' bets were correct.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the Publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some people are natural players; some are just plain lucky.  And though it can be hard to tell them apart, at least each has a name.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GROK:(n) A player who understands a game intuitively and completely and thus obtains success through skill.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GUMP:(n) A player who plays without obvious thought or plays randomly but nonetheless has consistent success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Not sure which you are? The games included in GROK-or-GUMP will figure it out for you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
