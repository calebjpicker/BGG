						               													<description>Boardquest is a turn-based strategy with RPG elements for 1-4 players. It replicates and condenses the experience of epic tabletop RPGs such as Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and Das Schwarze Auge and remixes it with elements known from widely beloved video and board games (Warcraft, Heroscape, Gloomhaven, and others).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game the players lead their chosen faction towards taking control over the map: the winner either defeats all enemy heroes or conquers the required number of forts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a player you will utilize common and rare weapons, leverage your character's unique abilities and spells, and recruit specialized units to join your army. As the the game progresses your hero will become more powerful and master more advanced abilities. The land of Liria is infested by monsters, some rather unsophisticated and some highly complex, dropping XP points, gold, and loot when defeated. The players will face the creatures and level-up as they prepare for the final face-off with their contestants to Liria's throne...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
