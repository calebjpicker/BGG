						               													<description>--Introduction--&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 12 Towers is an RPG board game for 2-6 players. The objective is to take control of all. Active Towers, and/or eliminate the opposing players. &amp;#10;Players take the role of &amp;ldquo;Keepers&amp;rdquo;, powerful rulers that control a Tower, and its surrounding territory. Throughout the course of the game, Towers will be &amp;#10;gained, lost, or even destroyed. Controlling Towers will involve combat, diplomacy, and teamwork. However, it may also involve treachery and deception.&amp;#10;                 &amp;#10;            While the objectives of the game are clear, it is entirely up to the players to decide how they play the game individually. Some may be aggressive &amp;#10;and charge head on, while others might focus on defensive actions. In the end, when players interact, they are in complete control of their own fate. &amp;#10;Not only do you bring a strategy to the game, you bring your personality as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;--Brief Overview of the game--&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players: 2-6&amp;#10;Game Type: PvP, RPG, Exploration, Board Control&amp;#10;Game Board: 32 x 32 Inch Dodecahedron (13 pieces)&amp;#10;Movement Style: Set space amount (Can be increased or decreased)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Components:&amp;#10; - 12 Keeper Figurines&amp;#10; - 12 Tower Figurines&amp;#10; - 12 Colored Die&amp;#10; - 576 Game Cards&amp;#10; - 6 Tracker Sheets&amp;#10; - 12 5x7 Tower Cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Run Time:&amp;#10; Easy/2 Players - 30/60 Minutes&amp;#10; Medium/4 to 6 Players - 45/90 Minutes&amp;#10; Hard/8 to 12 Players - 120/180 Minutes&amp;#10;&amp;#10;--Game Board--&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board for The 12 Towers uses a hexagon battle grid.
