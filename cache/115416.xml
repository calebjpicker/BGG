						               													<description>Card game issued one card at a time in cigarettes made by W A &amp;amp; A C Churchman. Two games are described using these cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Frisky Families is a Happy Families game. 52 cards were issued, in 13 sets of four. Each set of four is attributed to a different animal. Frisky himself, is card no 1 and he is a rabbit. The game play is similar to other set collecting games. In his turn, a player may ask another player for a certain card. If that player has such a card, he must hand it over. The turn can now be extended by asking for another card, and so on. When you have a set of four, you may lay it in front of you. After all 13 sets have been collected, the player with the most sets, wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 2 is just called Frisky.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a trick-taking game. In effect, you play with 52 cards, all in one suit, and the higher card is most likely to take the trick. The cards are ranked 2 to 52. Card 1, Frisky' is the highest card though and will always win the trick in which he is played. After all the cards have been played, the player with the most cards in tricks, wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original game was published in 1935. Since then, there has been at least one reproduction set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
