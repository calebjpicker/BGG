						               													<description>Played across a constantly changing gravitational playing surface, Senryaku is a Pure Abstract Strategy Game.&amp;#10;strategic planning is essential in this uniquely engaging game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Decision of movement combined with dexterity, requiring a singular capture or forced&amp;#10;gravitational drop to win the game. Played singularly or played over a multiple of games to determine an overall winner when combined with the additional scoring board.(supplied).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Not to be mistaken with pure balance where you would need direct equal counter balance. Senryaku operates by a wedging system resulting in 2 pinnacle points thus allowing a number of Spheres to be unequally moved on the board before it reaches a point in which it will tip.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Offensive and Defensive moves can be assisted by utilizing the counterbalance of the board trying to force your opponent to make the wrong decision.  &amp;#10; Positional Moves&amp;#10;The White and Black Spheres&amp;#10;In Singular moves spheres may move forward, left, right and diagonally forward but &amp;#10;CANNOT MOVE BACKWARDS&amp;#10;SPHERES MUST BE LIFTED TO MOVE and cannot be rolled, once lifted the move must be made.&amp;#10;When a sphere has been moved a player must move an alternative sphere before returning to &amp;#10; the last one they moved in order to move that sphere again.&amp;#10;The coloured Spheres&amp;#10;In Singular moves spheres may move forward, left, right and diagonally forward but &amp;#10;CANNOT MOVE BACKWARDS&amp;#10;SPHERES MUST BE LIFTED TO MOVE and cannot be rolled, once lifted the move must be made.&amp;#10;The Coloured spheres may be moved at anytime during the game without requirement to move an alternative sphere first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY SENRYAKU&amp;#10;Traditionally White Moves first, the object of the game is to make a single capture of your&amp;#10;opponents coloured sphere whilst protecting that of your own.&amp;#10;In order to make the capture a players sphere must be in an indentation next to the coloured &amp;#10;sphere they wish to capture.&amp;#10;When the Decision has been made to make the capture, the player must first remove the coloured&amp;#10;sphere to be captured, then must move into the indentation it was removed from to complete the &amp;#10;move and claim the win. ( Remembering no spheres can move backwards ).&amp;#10;NO OTHER SPHERES ARE TAKEN DURING THE GAME. Requires decision of movement only&amp;#10;CRASHING THE BOARD&amp;#10;If a player lifts a sphere or places a sphere which causes the board to crash at any point during play&amp;#10;they will loose the game.&amp;#10;NO MOVE LOSS&amp;#10;Should a player play themselves in a position that they have no further moves available&amp;#10;they must forfeit the Game.&amp;#10;MULTIPLE GAME SCORING&amp;#10;Capturing the opponents coloured sphere  ( 2 POINTS ) move the sphere on the scoring board 2 moves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Opponent to crashing  the board  ( 1 POINT ) move the sphere on the scoring board 1 move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Opponent has no further moves and forfeit's the game ( 1 POINT ) move the sphere on the scoring&amp;#10;board 1 move&amp;#10;The overall winner in a multiple game event will be the first to position there sphere on the scoring&amp;#10;board where the opponent started from.&amp;#10;PLAYERS MUST NOT HOLD THE BOARD or TRY TO RESET THE BOARD DURING PLAY THIS WILL&amp;#10;RESULT IN FORFEITING THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Before Making Decisions Based on Balance of probability, &amp;#10;                              You must first Respect the Ability of your opponent&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;adapted from a description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
