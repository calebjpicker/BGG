						               													<description>SLAMORAMA! is a crazy and I mean crazy wrestling card game that will engage your full mental capacity as much as it will tickle your funny bone. Two to four players can brawl in this mental slap-stick game as they pit their moves against each other. You start out by picking one of four wacky wrestlers; &amp;quot;Glittersaurus Wrecks&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Mountain Man Rick&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;El Alacran&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;The She-E-O&amp;quot; with their arsenal of insane moves to take out their opponents. Whoever wins the most cards wins the game and you do that by collecting the most tricks. (Publisher Description)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Slamorama is a 2-4 player wrestling card game from Binary Cocoa! Players all play their best moves against each other to win rounds, and whoever wins the most rounds by the time the cards are gone wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to play:&amp;#10;1. Each player is given a deck of 13 cards that consists of wrestling moves like punches or slaps or suplexes. 1 is the strongest &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; card, while 7 is the weakest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Players then count to three and throw down what they think will be the strongest move, and whoever that is wins the round! On a tie players throw down an additional card until someone finally wins. No one wins the round if the tie occurs on the last round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Rounds go until all players decks are empty, and whoever wins the most rounds wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special Features:&amp;#10;1. Each wrestler has a signature move that fits their persona. For example. Mountain Man Rick's Special move is the Salmon Slam. He literally picks people up and swings them around like a bear on the Snake River. Glittersaurus Wrecks special move is the rise and shine. She will lift you up just to bring you down. Very down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. The game allows for future expansions that will provide more wrestlers! We are planning on calling this first edition the &amp;quot;Red Deck&amp;quot;, and (pending successful funding) we will be coming out with a &amp;quot;Green Deck&amp;quot;. The Green Deck will have all new wrestlers so that you can combine decks and have up to 8 players in a game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alternate Game Modes:&amp;#10;In a standard game of Slamorama each player gets a deck of 13 cards and can have 4 in their hand that they can look at. Each full deck of Slamorama comes with two additional gameplay modes that include the following:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Full Deck Mode - Where you have all 13 cards in your hand and can look at them. Saves time from having to draw cards. Gives more &amp;quot;tactical advantage&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tag Team Mode - Players choose a partner and play their cards together against opponents to win rounds! They cannot look at or tell each other what they are going to throw down however. Fun with bigger groups!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Contents:&amp;#10;52 cards (13 for each wrestler)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3 rule cards (each with a unique way of playing the game)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 tuck box to hold the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
