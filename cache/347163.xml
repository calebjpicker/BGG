						               													<description>Shortly after Poland was conquered in 1939, Hitler begin urging an immediate attack in the West. The original plans were uninspiring and his generals feared an attritional stalemate. Over the winter the Germans keep taking the measure of their opponents and hit upon a plan was that inspired, risky, and utterly decisive. Ironic of Hitler to assume his remarkable success was simply the new template for all future campaigns. His eyes turned east.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But why, exactly, did France fall? Against the Odds 2017 Annual  features four top designers all tasked with re-examining the 1940 campaign and answering that very question.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;'Betrayal!' is a strategic level game of the German invasion of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in May 1940. After &amp;#10;finishing campaigns in Poland, Denmark, and Norway, Hitler turned to France. The goal was to knock France down and &amp;#10;then prepare for the subjugation of Britain and the invasion of the Soviet Union.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pre-war planning, coupled with valuable experience gained in Poland, would lead the Wehrmacht to excel in lightning &amp;#10;warfare never before seen on such a massive scale. While the French had re-visited World War One with a static Maginot &amp;#10;Line defending their border, the Germans went beyond this and brought in blitzkrieg. There were a few bumps along the &amp;#10;way. The smaller British army and those from tiny Belgium and Netherlands tried to help France.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has two Allied players, one French and one British. They will alternate, depending on initiative, in handling &amp;#10;the automata German side. Internal differences between the allies can arise according to their separate and unique victory conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
