						               													<description>Made the Cut! is a statistically accurate shot by shot simulation of the PGA Tour. Each of the 2019 set golfers are unique and will perform according to various individual golf statistics provided they play a similar golf schedule as in real life. Each golfer was rated for their driving ability, ability to hit greens, short game and putting. The courses have been rated for each round of play and each hole, based on the 2019 statistics. This helps capture easy or tough pin placements; good or bad weather conditions and easy or hard holes in general.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Made the Cut! includes a risk/reward strategy option for the player when taking approach shots to the Green. You can choose to play standard, with no adjustments to the Golfer card or you can choose to Pin Hunt (PH) or Safe Play (SP).  PH reduces golfer&amp;rsquo;s chance to hit the green in regulation, but if they do, the golfer has a greater chance of sinking the putt. However, a missed Green is on the &amp;ldquo;wrong side&amp;quot;, adding pressure to golfer&amp;rsquo;s Short Game play. On the other hand, a golfer choosing to SP will find it easier to hit the green in regulation, but leave a longer than normal putt. However, a missed Green is on the &amp;ldquo;right side&amp;rdquo;, taking pressure away from golfer's Short Game play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play a single golfer through his 2019 PGA Tour schedule, maybe just a handful of contenders or all players that Made the Cut! Play only the Majors, a handful of events or the entire season.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 2019 PGA Season Set includes approximately 260 golfers who earned at least a single Fedex point throughout the 2019 season AND played enough holes to record accurate statistics. It also includes courses and tournament information for all 44 events played out each weekend of the 2019 PGA Season, including complete fields!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
