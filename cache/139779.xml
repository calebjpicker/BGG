						               													<description>You will manage and guide the migration of five species of birds. However, not every specie has the same flight habits flight and do not travel the same distance. You will therefore have to adaptat your strategy and to play the right cards at the right time, pay attention to obstacles, and keep an eye on the opponent's game ...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player must manage migration up to 5 birds (Brant, Black Kite, Black-winged Stilt, European Bee-eater and teal) to send them to the destination. Players will straight ahead at maximum 4 colonies simultaneously. A turn begins and ends with still 3 cards in hand, and each turn, each player may put a card in the game to start a colony or complete one (provided that the number of birds on the card is equal or lower than the previous). On the cards are the target for each type of bird (a number of cards of this type of bird), the distribution of the number of birds for each type of bird and if it is migrant birds day only, night only, or day and night. Because the maps corresponding to phases of flight day will be put face up, face down but those night! Rather than place a card, the player can if desired separate colony in two of his game, and reassociate into two colonies.&amp;#10;At the end of his turn, a player must discard a card from his hand and complement 3 by drawing cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player has reached the goal of a specie (a number of cards depending on the type of bird), he puts his colony in a heap next to his game and can not migrate these birds . The last card that will put equal to the number of points that this bird brings him. The opponent may still him in his game to migrate this type of bird.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will also play cards &amp;quot;Dangers&amp;quot; (Hunter day, night light pollution and destruction of natural day and night), which can steal a card from an opponent among current flight phases or among birds which have reached their destination.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when one of the two players that get the fifth type of bird, the two players combined. The winner is whoever has the most points (numbers of birds arrive at their destination for every type of bird).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
