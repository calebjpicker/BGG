						               													<description>Assassins the Hotel is set in modern times but with a slight time line detour. It is based off the Blood of the Raven Skirmish Rules and is all about you playing as an elite Assassins completing their assignments!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To the outside world, you appear normal along with having an everyday 9-5 job. You get up every morning and waive at your neighbors as you collect your morning paper to read while drinking a fresh cup of coffee. As you sit and read the paper, you have a smirk on your face because you see your work from the night before as part of the unsolved investigations. The cops have no fucking clue where to look and will never find the answers they are searching for. Even if they did, they couldn&amp;rsquo;t fucking touch you since you are part of an elite secret assassination organization that brings death to anyone willing to pay for it. To all others, you are just a normal everyday businessperson but to your targets&amp;hellip;you are an elite assassin from Angelus Mortis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
