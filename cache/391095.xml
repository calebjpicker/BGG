						               													<description>In this easy-to-learn game, you attempt to manipulate dice on a shared board to achieve your objectives. The game is pretty straightforward as you fulfill objectives to get points and the most points at the end of the game is the winner. Throughout the game, you'll play action cards to place and manipulate dice on a board in an effort to complete your objectives. At the same time, others may have conflicting objectives and may end up altering your gameplan. Once the board fills up, the game is over and the person with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is great for gamers and non-gamers alike as it's pretty quick to pick up and play. The dice mechanics make sure that the game is different each time, however. There's plenty of strategy and many different ways to play your turns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
