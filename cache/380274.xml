						               													<description>In a distant corner of the world stands a mountain that is shrouded in myth and mystery. As legend has it, the mine that descends deep below the mountain has magical properties: no matter how many sacks of precious gemstones you procure from its tunnels, the mine will always be full to the brim with treasures. The best jewellers in the land decided to take advantage of this wondrous source to craft the most amazing jewelry pieces. They compete against each other to prove that they are worthy of the highest reward possible, the magic anvil.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gem Forge is a versatile family game with a unique 3D pop-up game board and magical illustrations. Procure rare gemstones from the magical mine and store them in your gem box. Then, set exquisite jewelry pieces with the collected gem stones. Finally, receive victory points for finished pieces and jewelry sets!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the start, set everything up according the rules: players will have the magic mountain with the gems in random, player pawns and the reminder cards of the same color, player boards or minecarts, 3 jewelry cards, special cards. Set up the market of jewelries with 4 cards to choose. Special cards deck should be placed face down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player can be chosen randomly. At their turn, players have to perform 2 of 5 possible actions: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Take a gemstone from the mountain. The new gem must be placed to the player's minecarts. There are 3 spaces for gems.&amp;#10;     Set a gemstone to jewelry. &amp;#10;     Discard a gemstone from your minecart. Players may free the space for the new gems.&amp;#10;     Draw a special card.&amp;#10;     Play a special card. The special cards which should be played during other players turn do not spend your actions. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players get points for the jewelries they make. The number of points is shown at the bottom of jewelry cards. &amp;#10;There are gold (ordinary)  and blue (for collections/sets) jewerly cards. Sometimes players may create a collection of jewerlies with the gemstones of the same color and get even more points.&amp;#10;After a jewelry has all the required gems, it is ready. &amp;#10;Return the gems to the mountain, discard the card, and take a new one from the market. Move the pawn on the scoring track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player gets to the highlighted spaces of 5,10,15,20 scores, all the players having less points get a special card. &amp;#10;Special cards have various effects affecting either you or other players. A player should not have more than 4 special cards. If a player has 4 cards and is required to take the new one, they discard one at their choice and then take he new card.&amp;#10;The player who gets to the final spot on the scoring track first wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
