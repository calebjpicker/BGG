						               													<description>Ideal for family play and easy to play alone between childhoods. Between 2 cards&amp;hellip; Which image is repeated??? mmmm&amp;hellip; I ALREADY SAW IT!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You have to say it quickly, as soon as you found the match. The more attention you have, the easier you will see them! Hurry up, concentrate, wake up because in this game, speed rushes us and fun awaits us. If you take two cards and look closely, you will see that they always have one image in common (one and only one). So the goal of the game (in its 5 variants) is to find that common image between two cards and name them as quickly as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1- Pile, Pile with challenges!&amp;#10;A card with images is distributed to each participant and the rest are placed in a pile in the center, with the images visible. You must look for the common image between the card that touched you and the first of the stack. Whoever names the match first draws the center card and places it on top of their own pile. when a challenge card appears, whoever meets it first wins the indicated cards. The game ends when there are no more cards in the center of the table and whoever collects the most cards wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2- Discard with challenges!&amp;#10;Opposite of &amp;quot;Stack, stack&amp;quot;: a card is placed in the center of the table and the rest are distributed among those who play. Each participant has to find the common image between the card that is on the table and the first of their stack. When the match is found, it quickly drops it on the table, discarding itself. Whoever runs out of cards first wins. In this variant they also play the 4 challenge cards, each time a participant reveals one of these cards, they must read it aloud to the rest... So everyone participates!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3- The jersey (without challenges)&amp;#10;In the center of the table 9 cards are placed face up. The jersey is assembled by finding the same image on three different cards. Whoever forms them first and names the image that matches, takes all three cards (which must be replaced so that there are always 9 cards on the table). Once the cards are finished, whoever collected the most wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4- Take it yourself! (no challenges)&amp;#10;Each participant receives a card face down. The remaining cards are placed in a stack face up in the center of the table. Each participant has to find the common image between the card of the center and that of any participant (except their own). When the match is found, give the center card to whoever has the card with the match. Whoever keeps the most cards loses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5- Pass it fast! (no challenges)&amp;#10;Each participant puts a card on the palm of his hand, in view of the rest. When someone finds the image in common between one card and another, he puts his own card on the matching card. Here nobody wins, but whoever keeps all the cards at the end loses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
