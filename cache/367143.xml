						               													<description>Cheat evolution. Breed new creatures from elephants, tigers and the like by mating. Funny combinations arise, such as the crophant or the turtdile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But watch out for the rabbit! His mating behavior can mess up your planning a bit...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 6th Day by Axel Hennig is a solo game for ages 8 and up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Help nature a little bit. Pair two animals with each other and marvel at the result. Your goal is to have the most valuable collection of animals after four generations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle all 18 numbered cards except the rabbit and place the first green, blue and yellow card from the top of the pile in the center of the table.&amp;#10;As a deck, you then take the remaining 15 cards in your hand. The red end-of-round card goes behind the deck.&amp;#10;If you play the rabbit variant, the rabbit goes behind the end-of-round card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, you look at the top three cards of your deck. &amp;#10;After that, you have two choices: The evolution pause or the mating.&amp;#10;If you can't or don't want to mate any animals, you put one of the three cards to the right of the three cards in the evolution pause and then you take one of the three cards and put it behind your deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To mate, use the mating options shown on the cards. &amp;#10;Directional arrows also show you action requests for pairing. You turn one of the two cards involved either around its center axis or its long side and then put it behind the deck as usual.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you see an exclamation mark next to the direction arrow, put the card aside. If you do, you won't be able to develop it, but it will earn you points in the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The other card used for pairing is placed in the center of the table. Then take a new card from the three already there and put it behind your deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as the red end-of-round card is the top card in the deck, turn it according to its directional arrow and put it back behind your deck.&amp;#10;After the fourth round, total up your points by adding up the values of all the cards (from the center of the table, your deck, and the cards already set aside), taking into account any bonuses you have unlocked.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For example, if you have upgraded both Chameleons twice, you get nine points instead of six.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;VARIANT WITH RABBITS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you have familiarized yourself with the game, you can use the rabbit.&amp;#10;Play two rounds, one without rabbit and one with rabbit using the same card order in your deck. Before starting the first round, write down the order of the card numbers to be able to create an equal deck for the second round.&amp;#10;Try to avoid a mating rabbit as this costs you victory points.&amp;#10;Your goal is to score more points in the round with the rabbit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
