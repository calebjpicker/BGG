						               													<description>An interactive children's memory game.  Taking turns each player tries to find a matching 'Crazy Creature' which matches the Hide and Seek card.  If a player successfully finds a match they can move 'IT' one space closer to their opponents Gotcha circle.  When 'IT' reaches either players Gotcha circle the other player is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game simulates a game of hide and seek and allows the players to interact with each other using phrases like 'You're it' and 'Gotcha'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;---&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Find the hidden creatures to win this easy to play memory game.&amp;#10;For 2 players aged 4 years upwards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game for 2 players aged 4 onwards.&amp;#10;OBJECT:&amp;#10;To keep out of the CAUGHT YOU space by selecting the correct hiding Crazy Creature.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PREPARATION:&amp;#10;1. Place the playing strip on the table with the yellow CAUGHT YOU space in front of one player sitting one side of the table and the blue CAUGHT YOU space in front of the other, sitting opposite.&amp;#10;2. Attach MR. IT to his stand and place him on the start facing the yellow end of the playing strip.&amp;#10;3. The player at the yellow and of the playing strip takes the eight HIDING PLACE cards with the yellow sky and places them lace (CRAZY CREATURE SIDE) down spread out in a straight line in front of him. The player at the blue and does the same with the blue cards.&amp;#10;4. The Crazy Creature cards are shuffled and stacked face down on the table between the two rows of HIDING PLACE cards.&amp;#10;5. The top Crazy Creature card is turned over, showing the players which creature they are looking for, and the game i.e. ready to begin.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;The player on the yellow side of the playing strip starts by reaching over and turning one of his opponent's HIDING PLACE cards over to find the Crazy Creature of the same colour as on the card in the centre. If the creature on the HIDING PLACE card does not match he turns the &amp;quot;HIDING PLACE&amp;quot; card back over and his turn ends. The player on the blue side now turns one of his opponent&amp;rsquo;: HIDING PLACE cards to find the same Crazy Creature.&amp;#10;When a player turns a HIDING PLACE card and finds the matching Crazy Creature, he yells YOU'RE IT and turns MR. IT to face his opponent and moves MR. lT one step towards his opponent's CAUGHT YOU space. The hiding place card is left face up. He then turns over a new Crazy Creature card in the centre and goes again, looking for the next Crazy Creature.&amp;#10;If all 8 Crazy Creature cards in the centre have been turned over before MR. IT gets to a CAUGHT YOU space, the Crazy Creature cards are re-shuffled and placed face down between the players. The players then turn all hiding place cards Crazy Creature side down and rearrange them. The last player to find the hiding Crazy Creature continues the play and turns over the top Crazy Creature card in the centre.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player moves MR. IT into his opponent's CAUGHT YOU space, he wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
