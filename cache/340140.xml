						               													<description>An intriguing party game, which stimulates empathy between players. Tell an episode you lived and imagine the moods you felt: will others be able to guess them?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The youngest player starts and briefly tells a real fact that he has experienced or an imaginary situation that could happen to him, without naming the emotions he felt. In the situation described, he must imagine the prevailing emotions he felt before, during and at the end of what happened.  He then writes on his card (with the erasable marker) the number 1 in correspondence with the emotion he felt before, the number 2 in correspondence with the emotion he felt during and the number 3 in correspondence with the emotion that he has  tried in the end.  All this, taking care not to show your card to your opponents.  In the meantime, the other competitors also proceed to mark the emotions they imagine on their cards was able to try the narrator before, during and at the end. At this point, the emotion cards are revealed and scores are calculated by comparing the narrator's emotion card with those of the competitors.  The game continues in the same way: the new narrator will be the next in a clockwise direction to the last hand, Warning: if during the story the narrator names an emotion (for example he says &amp;quot;I was very anxious before the exam&amp;quot;)  game and the turn passes to the next competitor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each competitor earns 1 point for each emotion right in the right time position within the story.  He receives a 3-point bonus if he guesses all three emotions in the right order.  The narrator earns 1 point for each of the emotions guessed by the contestants.  Each player keeps his score by taking the appropriate tokens.  The winner is the one who has scored the most points after 1 or 2 laps (at the competitors' choice).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
