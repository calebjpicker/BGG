						               													<description>Shodo is the name given to Japanese calligraphy, considered by many people a true art, quite difficult to be perfected. Shodo art learners must have discipline and observe the techniques in each lesson taught by their master. Therefore, in this game, each player is an apprentice of this art, and therefore must execute the lessons passed by his master, joining the pieces that contain traces of traces, forming the calligraphic drawings required by one of the lessons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player, on his turn, must manage his amount of paint, produced in his Suzuri, which will serve to acquire new pieces of strokes that complete his calligraphic designs or start new ones. The available pieces are renewed on the table as the players use them. Calligraphic drawing lesson cards are arranged randomly with each game, and players must observe the strategy of the other players to try to complete the lessons before the others, which will give them more points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Completing a calligraphic drawing may not be as simple as doing so requires completing all the strokes already started. Once a drawing is completed and is also compatible with one of the available lessons (requirements may consist of the number of strokes, the shape of the drawing, or even the level of detail), the player may place one of his markers in that lesson. The first to place, in addition to receiving more points, make it impossible for the latter to place markers in the lessons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all the lessons have been completed by at least one person, the game will be over, and it will be the winner who made the most points, obtained through the complexity of their calligraphic designs and the accomplishment of the lessons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
