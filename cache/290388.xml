						               													<description>After a war that almost destroyed the Earth, seven powerful factions, the so-called Regent Houses, now control the Earth and share their rule according to what is known as the Treaty. It is an almost perfect balance of power, since no House has enough strength to claim the throne they share by itself ... Until now.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One of the Regent Houses, the Envers House, has discovered how to travel to the distant worlds of the universe. And with those new worlds at their disposal to dominate and gain Power, all Houses seek to grow enough to claim the title of Earth Emperor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Rise of an Emperor: Worlds in Conflict, each player chooses one of the seven Regent Houses (each has 10 personalized cards) and two of the different paths that exist in the world of RoaE to gain power. Each of them (Science, Religion, Economy, Politics, Subterfuge, Military and Exploration) adds 20 more cards to build its initial deck. In addition, each House has three Counselors that can be used on the Council Board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players use cards for actions like increasing their House skills, raising their military and technological levels, building buildings, playing the characters of their House ...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The large number of cards in the game (770) allows a great variety of actions. You can make and break alliances with other races and civilizations, send assassins against your rivals, or spy on them to know what they hide. You can try to make your ruler a living God or be the richest House in the Universe. You can find alien artifacts, other races and friendly or hostile civilizations, worlds and moons, powerful strategic resources, build buildings such as the Academy of War or the Intelligence Center and an endless number of other options ...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each House has a personal board to develop their civilization, and to do so many of the cards must be built before they can be used ... but both space and resources are limited.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, there is the ubiquitous Treaty, which limits the Houses' actions. Many of the actions in the game are illegal ones. So in order to avoid the punishment we must cover them up or legalize them ... or maybe another House can catch us in fraganti !!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rise of an Emperor is a Civilizations 4x game, which uses mechanics like worker placement, hand and resource management, and hidden information management. Each game is different and the multiple combinations of customization make it highly replayable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
