						               													<description>In Road Warrior: The Tabletop Touring Experience, players start the game by drafting their band members from a pool of near professionals. Based on some of your favorite rockstars, you will find yourself in good company. After assembling their ideal four-piece, they take their act to the road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, players traverse a map of America playing shows and building fame. As they travel coast to coast, by drawing event cards they will run into some snags along the way (such as bus breakdowns and cancelled shows), but if luck is on their side they will also encounter some great windfalls (like hit singles or magazine features).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turns, players choose from a variety of actions. They will regularly drive around from city to city in their very own tour bus. Performing shows, by a simple roll of the dice, is a steady form of income in the form of points. Performing market research is a great way for players to figure out which cities are dying to see their band. Players will even find themselves challenging their opponents to turn the tides.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the game progresses, players will be drawn around the map to cities that are craving shows, some even hosting huge festivals. Complete these shows in exchange for big rewards, but beware, bigger wins also mean bigger losses. Failing shows no matter the size will increase the tension within your band, and if you don't keep it under control, it may just lead to your band's demise!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eventually, each player will find that their growing band has reached a point where they need some help. They can hire a variety of skilled roadies including bus drivers, guitar techs, sound engineers and more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To emerge victorious as a true Road Warrior, players must reach level 3 on the point track and complete at least 3 of the 4 game end goals. &amp;#10;  &amp;bull; Play each of the 4 industry cities&amp;#10;  &amp;bull; Play at least 10 successful shows in your home region&amp;#10;  &amp;bull; Hire 3 Roadies&amp;#10;  &amp;bull; Successfully challenge each other player at least once&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
