						               													<description>Hurray, your company just got a lucrative job: build a road between two cities.&amp;#10;But the computer managing the production line just went bananas and random building material comes out of the factory.&amp;#10;Do you give up? Well, partly.&amp;#10;Forget about joining the two cities with a wonderful infrastructure, just try to use the material as it is ready and build as much as you can!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Going Further is a very fast solo game, estimated playing time with standard rules is between 1 and 5 minutes (depending on the tiles you have). Its playing speed makes Going Further ideal to be played in group, challenging the score of your mates.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Going Further, in its standard playing mode, is a tile placement puzzle, as all the tiles are visible to the player. However, every game is different because only 32 randomly selected tiles, out of a 72 deck, are used for a single game.&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to built a continuous road by placing tiles picked from a limited number of available ones. As long as tiles are connected to the road, others become available to be chosen and played. The game ends when no more playable tiles are available.&amp;#10;The player shall choose the best strategy to unlock new tiles and prevent the game to end, while scoring as much points as possible. &amp;#10;In fact, each tile grants a different number of points; the total score consists of the sum of each individual tile points.&amp;#10;Additional points can be added or removed from the total, depending on the achieved road final configuration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be customized making it more or less difficult, or by introducing a luck element.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When more than one person is playing, each player takes his turn as for a solo game. The winner is the player able to score more points, after each one had his chance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
