						               													<description>Did you know the notorious detective Sherlock Holmes has lived adventures all around the world... and through time? On this occasion, our beloved character changes the 221B of Baker Street for Feudal Japan to investigate a mysterious theft inside the Palace of the Empress. However, this is a case he can't solve alone, and he will need your help to figure out what was stolen, who did it and where.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Sherlock in Time you'll have to investigate this mysterious crime with the help of several Clue cards that only you can see and one secret Clue card that only the other players can see. You'll have to show your cards to the other detectives so they can verify the number of clues that match your secret card. Only that way you'll be able to figure out what was stolen, who did it and where. But you'll have to do it quickly, because only the first and best are worthy of the great Sherlock Holmes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sherlock in Time is a game with easy and straightforward rules that you can expand with Watson in Time. With this game mode you'll get extra assistants with special skills that make the game more fun and unpredictable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Will you be smart enough to uncover the mystery that haunts the Palace of the Empress and earn Sherlock Holmes' respect?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
