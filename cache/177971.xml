						               													<description>Fantasy Football: Draft, Deals, and Dice (FF3D) is a card drafting and dice rolling game that allows players to simulate the fantasy football experience. FF3D is designed to be played with 2 or 4 players, though expansions can easily allow up to 16 players. FF3D can be played in anywhere from 60-120 minutes, depending on the length of time players spend on their initial drafting process.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base game of Fantasy Football: Draft, Deals, and Dice allows players to compete with each other over a shortened four week fantasy football season. The Owners have the opportunity to draft their fantasy rosters from a pool of randomized Players at the start of the season. The Team and Player Ratings are randomized at the start of each season, so no two seasons will ever be the same. One year, the San Francisco QB could be a star player with major upside &amp;ndash; the next year, he could be a mediocre talent that shrinks in the Primetime. The winner is able to initially assess the random market conditions of the league to maximize their draft selections within their roster restrictions, as well as able to navigate the flow of the season&amp;rsquo;s Defensive Matchups, Injuries, Hot Streaks better than their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After establishing agreed upon Roster Requirements for the League, the game begins with (and features) everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite part of the fantasy football season &amp;ndash; the fantasy draft.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game is split into three main segments:&amp;#10;The Fantasy Draft&amp;#10;The Regular Season&amp;#10;The Playoffs&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Owners will draft a team of Players and set their starting lineups against the opposing Owner on their Fantasy Schedule. The Owners take turns determining their Weekly Results by rolling a specified number of Offensive and Defensive dice for each Player in their Starting Lineup. The number and types of dice rolled are influenced by the Player's Skill and Upside Levels, as well as any Team Matchup Modifiers, Player Hot Streaks, or Player Injuries that have been assigned to the player during the game play. In-Game Events could also trigger unexpected outcomes that can swing the momentum during a game. After all games have been played, the Owner with the most points in the matchup receives the win. At the end of each week, Players are randomly selected to either go on a Hot Streak or go on the Injured Reserve. Owners may replace Injured players by following a Waiver and Free Agency process against the other Owners to select Players from the pool of unselected Players from the initial draft. The first three weeks make up the Regular Season, with the Top 2 teams competing in Week 4 for the Championship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
