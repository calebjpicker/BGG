						               													<description>&amp;#229;&amp;#133;&amp;#171;&amp;#228;&amp;#186;&amp;#186;&amp;#227;&amp;#129;&amp;#174;&amp;#233;&amp;#173;&amp;#148;&amp;#232;&amp;#161;&amp;#147;&amp;#229;&amp;#184;&amp;#171; (Hachi-nin no majutsu-shi) Eight Wizards is a two player fantasy card game from Japan.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the distant past, two rival beings possessing unimaginable magical power clashed for control of the world. In the end, their conflict triggered an incredible explosion of energy, resulting in the mutual destruction of these god-like beings. This explosion was so powerful, it twisted the very fabric of reality in upon itself, ripping the world in two and leaving time to flow in an infinite loop. Those who survived the brutal conflict soon realized the energy of these dead gods was slowly being drawn to the central point where the two worlds now met. Skilled in the art of energy manipulation, those known as Summoners are now able to harness the power stored in this central point, referred to as The Node, to conjure Wizards and Monsters to do battle. By defeating a conjured being in battle, Summoners can capture energy in special Gemstones. Only through the use of these energy-filled Gemstones can the loop finally be broken and order restored to the world. However, there is a catch. Only the side with the greatest amount of stored energy will survive when the two halves of the world merge once again. With the fate of their world at stake, the battle between the Summoners thus began.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game consists of 4 rounds with 5 battles. Each round is played as follows:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Attacker chooses one card from their hand and plays it face-up on the table. Activate any abilities that apply.&amp;#10;     The Defender then chooses 1 card from their hand and plays it face-up in front of the Attacker's card. Activate any abilities that apply.&amp;#10;     After all relevant abilities have been applied, compare the cards' Power levels. The card with the higher value wins.&amp;#10;     Turn the losing card sideways to the defeated position. (In the case of a tie, turn both cards sideways.) Note: A card is not considered &amp;quot;defeated&amp;quot; if the battle ended in a tie.&amp;#10;     Assign the role of Attacker to the player who won the battle, and Defender to their opponent. (In the case of a tie, the roles of Attacker and Defender remain the same as the previous battle.)&amp;#10;     Repeat steps 1-5 until all 5 battles have been played OR the special win condition is met.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all 4 rounds are finished, the player with more points showing on their Gemstones is declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
