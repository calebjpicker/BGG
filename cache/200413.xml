						               													<description>Cotto &amp;amp; Frullato is a game for only cool people. You've been recruited into a team of legendary action movie stars in the most epic competition in history. Finally the world will see who will be the best badass of all. Your task will be to taste different dishes that have been blended to pulp, recognize their nutritional benefits and assign them to each star of your team, in order to bring him / her to their highest physical supremacy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All the stars will face 4 Challenges: Strength, Resistance, Coolness and Charisma. But as we all know, physical strength is not enough. To win the Challenges you will need to let your stars drink cooked and blended dishes, so that every fiber of their organism can be pervaded by the right nutrients. Carbohydrates increase the strength, Fats increase the resistance, Proteins increase the coolness and Vitamins increase the charisma. Pay close attention, because the final victory will depend on your choices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First of all each player gets 2 or 3 stars each (according to the number of players), revealing them.&amp;#10;There are 2 stages: in the first one each player get some cards that represent dishes that have been blended with a drink. Each dish is divided into 5 ingredients. Players will place on the table 6 tokens (5 ingredients and 1 drink). All tokens are true (so they have a correspondence with those indicated on each card) but one, that is false. The opponents should guess whether an ingredient is true or false. They bet on one of theit choice thanks to their own double-faced token (1 side indicates TRUE, the other side indicates FALSE). Clearly betting on the false ingredient is harder, but it gives you a lot of rewards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Betting on ingredients allow players to obtain nutrition cards, that can improve the basic values of the stars. Carbohydrates improve Strength, Fats improve Resistance, Proteins improve Coolness and Vitamins improve Charisma.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all players played their dish cards allowing the opponents to guess ingredients and collect nutrition cards to assign to their stars, the stage 2 starts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All stars will face 4 challenges: Strength, Resistance, Coolness and Charisma. Players reveals all cards of each challenge assigned to the stars. The character with the highest score gains 3 victory points, the second only 1. In case of tie all characters at the first position gain 2 VP, while all characters at the second one gain 1 VP.&amp;#10;Then pass to the second challenge and so on. Each character, however, has a skill that can influence several moments of the game, making the results of the challenges always unpredictable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, the team's player with the highest rank (calculating the total amount of rewards of each star of his team) is the winner. In case of tie, the player with more nutrition cards assigned to his team is the winner. In further case of tie, players share the victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
