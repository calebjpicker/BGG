						               													<description>A game for the piecepack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;It was a beautiful summer day in the Kingdom of Frogtopia and four young and bored frogs of varying social classes were looking for a little adventure to pass the day. And the addition of danger would only make the adventure all that more exciting. One of the young frogs said he had heard of a dangerous game called Crocodile Hop that was played by the frog knights to prove one&amp;rsquo;s froghood in the olden days. A game where a frog knight would display his agility and bravery by taunting Young Croc while hopping from lily pad to lily pad. A game that occasionally ended with the loss of limb and sometimes even life. A game that was no longer played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Although one of the young frogs was a little hesitant to play such a reckless and dangerous game, comments were made about him being a tadpole and &amp;ldquo;Do I see still see a tail back there?&amp;rdquo; that eventually peer pressure won. &amp;ldquo;Besides Old Croc is now so old he can barely move and he is quite predictable&amp;rdquo; another one of the young frogs said. With that the young frogs headed out to the other side of the swamp looking for Old Croc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Once they arrived at the other side of the swamp they started to splash and make noise trying to rouse Old Croc. &amp;ldquo;Look there he is, there he is&amp;rdquo; said one of the young frogs &amp;ldquo;and he moves about as fast a slug in the mud&amp;rdquo;. Then Old Croc came up and with his huge mouth swallowed up a whole lily pad with just one bite. The young frogs started hopping from lily pad to lily pad as they yelled at old Old Croc &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll never get me you old slug&amp;rdquo; and the game began. Old Croc was popping up out of the water chomping down lily pads while the young frogs hopped from pad to pad before he could get them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Then one of the young frogs noticed something, there seemed to be less and less lily pads to jump to and the ones that were left were getting harder to reach. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s running us out of lily pads&amp;rdquo; he yelled and that was when the young frogs realized what they had gotten themselves into.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A mad hopping game for the piecepack -- hop your foolish young frogs to victory, while avoiding being eaten by Old Croc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
