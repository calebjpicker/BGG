						               													<description>There have been vicious falsehoods circulating, such as &amp;quot;Hoshou Marin is in her 30s.&amp;quot; This is truly deplorable.&amp;#10;The captain would never lie about his age!&amp;#10;Look at her profile on the official website, it says she is &amp;quot;roughly 17 years old!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;What is needed to counteract the hoax and correct the perceptions of the Internet community is good assertiveness.&amp;#10;Let us, the members gathered here today, compete in our assertions and improve our skills for the coming day.&amp;#10;Now let's get to the question, Hosho Marin is 17 years old!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The numbers 0 to 5 and 8 to 10 appear, but 0, 5, and 10 have different reverse patterns, so the player deduces his or her hand by using that as a clue.&amp;#10;Since the same numbers can be treated as one card, the sexy structure of the game increases both risk and chance at the same time as the number of cards in the hand increases.&amp;#10;If you are the only one left in the hand, you have a chance to score a lot of points, and so on!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
