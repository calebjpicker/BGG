						               													<description>In the early 1990&amp;rsquo;s a Russian antarctic expedition began drilling through the ice to a fresh water Lake dubbed Lake Vostok.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On Feb 2012 they succeeded in drilling more than 2,000 miles. It took more than 30 years.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many raised concerns of the risks of breaking a barrier to a lake sealed off between 15 and 34 million years. But someone made the call that breaking this barrier was worth the risk.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because the quantity of oxygen in Lake Vostok exceeds anywhere on our planet by 10-20X. Scientists predicted they would find new species that evolved far differently than any seen before.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the initial research was completed a conspiracy theory propagated online. One of the Russian scientists defected. He claimed a highly intelligent creature, a new organism, engaged with them and killed some team members. This is where our Vostok story begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a distress signal was received an unprecedented storm cut all contact with Vostok Station. As the storm raged on without any signs of letting up, multiple recon teams were sent. Your team is the only one to make it. After crashing 10 clicks away, you arrive at the aftermath of a massacre. Early into the reconnaissance you realize the story of the station goes much deeper.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is based on a First Strike Combat System. Players must battle physically and meta physically. Players also learn to control insanity and weaponize it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An AI is provided to assist your team to off-set the intelligence of the new organism. The AI assists in many ways including scientific, weapon and ammunition recipes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are several player characters to choose from with varying capabilities. Players are free to assemble the kind of team they prefer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your team must fully explore the Russian station, re-establish communications, report back on the status and insure the chamber to the lake is sealed. Your team wins if they can make it the chamber and confirm it is sealed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
