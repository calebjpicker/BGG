						               													<description>A legacy game where you throw cards, not footballs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inspired on the cult film The Room.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Released in the September 2016 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;INITIAL SETUP&amp;#10;Separate the deck into red/black cards &amp;amp; remove the jokers; give one set to each player. Each player shuffles their deck and draws 5 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GOAL&amp;#10;Earn the most points. Points accrue over games with the same deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TURN&amp;#10;You must choose one action:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Draw: Draw from 1-5 cards from your deck, then discard that many cards. Discarded cards will not be available to you again this game.&amp;#10;     Play: Play one card from your hand to your tableau, then draw one card from your deck.&amp;#10;     Tear: Tear apart one card from a set in your tableau and throw half of it at your opponent's tableau.&amp;#10;     Replace: Replace a card matching the number of one of your previously destroyed cards with half of your destroyed card from your reserve, then throw that half at your opponent's tableau. Shuffle the whole card back into your deck, then draw one card.&amp;#10;     Score: Tear apart one card from a set, discard the rest of that set from your tableau, then add that set's value to your score (points according to a table). Add both halves to your reserve (instead of throwing that torn card).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TEARING APART &amp;amp; THROWING&amp;#10;You may tear apart any card in a set from your tableau to throw half at your opponent's tableau. If it touches any of your opponent's cards, you may choose one and any in its set to discard from the game. You earn half the points that your opponent would have earned from scoring that set. You determine which cards are in that set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you have thrown half of a card, you cannot throw it again during that game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SETS&amp;#10;A set is a grouping of paired and sequential cards played  to the tableau. It must meet all of the following three conditions:&amp;#10;1) To start a set, there must be a matching pair of numbers.&amp;#10;2) A set can be extended +1/-1 from any pair in the set. Aces wrap.&amp;#10;3) Sets must be touching each other in the tableau.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;END OF GAME&amp;#10;When a player needs to draw but cannot, their opponent gets one final turn and the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SETUP FOR SUBSEQUENT GAMES&amp;#10;All torn cards are placed in your reserve at the start of the game.The starting player is the player with the current lower score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;END OF ALL GAMES&amp;#10;When the game ends without either player scoring any points, the game is all torn apart. The player with the highest total score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
