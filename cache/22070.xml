						               													<description>From the Publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;It&amp;rsquo;s the big game.  You&amp;rsquo;re there.  You&amp;rsquo;re in your seat.  You&amp;rsquo;re ready.  But then, Oh-oh!  Suddenly you feel the need &amp;ndash; the need for greed!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s PIE TIME!!  Quick, out of your seat!  Out of the stadium!! Go get those pies and get back with them before the clock runs out!!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But, hold on! You&amp;rsquo;re not alone.  Look around you!  There are other players &amp;ndash; and they&amp;rsquo;re after YOUR PIES!!  They&amp;rsquo;re just as needy, just as greedy, but are they just as speedy as you?!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And from a publisher's press release:&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The setting of the game is a sports stadium surrounded by concession stands selling Pies.  Your playing piece is one of 8 comically greedy cartoon characters with a single-minded desire for Pies.  With the clock ticking, the object of the game is to move your character out of the stadium, rush from Pie-stand to Pie-stand collecting as many Pies as possible and return with them to your seat before the time runs out.  But, along the way, there are a myriad of dirty tricks and hazards.  Elbow your opponents as you pass and make them drop their Pies!  Trip them up and make them miss a turn!  Make them slip on Banana Peels and make them drop a Pie AND miss a turn!!  Lock them out of turnstiles!  Lock them out of bathrooms!  And, of course, your opponents are going to try to do the same to you.  Plus, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to be careful of those turnstiles &amp;ndash; you and your Pies might not fit through them!  And, all the time, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to watch out for those Pies &amp;ndash; some of them are Dodgy Pies!  They might not like you as much as you like them!!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game the players' decide how many rounds they will play and set the timer for the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
