						               													<description>Basic Outline:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with one shogun card, three daimyo cards and five samurai cards. All players also draw five action cards each at the start of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of Honour Bound is to KILL the other opponent's Shogun to have complete reign over feudal Japan and win the game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 1: Selection&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Player selects a character of their army and places it face down&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When both cards are placed down they they are flipped over at the same time&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 2: Honour Declaration&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both players roll the dice to determine their base honour level&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you have played a Samurai card then you can roll once. A Daimyo is two rolls and a Shogun is three rolls. The sum of all your rolls are added together to become your base honour level&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the lowest honour level is on the defensize&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 3: Tactics&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can place their initial actions cards if any are available, the defensive player places their initial action card first, but the offensive player can also play an initial action card after the defensive player has decided to play theirs or pass their turn&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 4: Swordplay&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The defensive player must place their active action cards to either increase or decrease their honour level by using a power card, or reduce their opponents honour level by using a protection card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eevery time a card is played the offensive player has the option to play an action card to counter the defensive player if they wish&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This goes on back and forth until a player can no longer defend itself&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the defensive player can no longer place action cards or chooses not to, they discard their army card into the army discard pile and the offensive player takes their army card back into their deck&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both players then take an action card and phase 1 loops back until a Shogun is killed and the winner is declared&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
