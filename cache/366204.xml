						               													<description>It's burger time!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fill orders by stacking your ingredient cards the fastest.  Careful not to make too many mistakes, or your customers won't be pleased...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the highest points earned from their completed orders, wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Full rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Each player is given 5 each of 10 ingredient cards. They can arrange the ingredient cards in front of themselves however they choose. &amp;#10;     The order deck is shuffled and placed face-down in the center of the table. 3. All players take one card from the order deck without looking at the card, and hold the cards above the center of the table face-down. One player takes two cards. The order cards are placed face-up in the center of the table at the same time. &amp;#10;     Everyone races to make one of the burger orders from their ingredient piles. All players go simultaneously. &amp;#10;     When a player finishes an order they grab the order card from the center of the table and place it on top of their gathered ingredients. They place the stack in their section of the table and flip over a new ingredient card from the order deck. &amp;#10;         When building a burger the player should hold the cards for the current burger they are working on in their hands. &amp;#10;         Ingredients must be in the same order they are on the order card with the top burger ingredient on top and the bottom ingredient on the bottom of the stack. &amp;#10;         Players can make an order from any of the cards that are flipped over, they do not have to make an order from the card they flip over. &amp;#10;         If another player completes an order and grabs the order card you were working from, you need to start over with a different order. &amp;#10;         Players can only build one burger at a time, but they can always modify their current, un finished burger that is in their hand. &amp;#10;         Once a player picks up an order card for their burger, the player cannot modify that burger anymore. &amp;#10;         A player can grab any face-up order card whether or not their burger fulfills the order. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fulfill the order exactly, the player may lose points. &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;     Players continue to make orders until one player runs completely out of one of their ingredients. Once they run out they say DONE and everyone must stop what they are doing immediately. &amp;#10;     Players now become the customers and move one spot to the left to verify each burger order is correct for that player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
