						               													<description>INTRODUCTION&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vault is an abstract game in which each player tries to reach the opponent&amp;rsquo;s back rank. Vault is named after pole vaulting, which is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole as an aid to jump over a bar. Vault is a derivative of Onager, by the same designer and uses a variation of its jumping mechanism (also present in Billabong, for example) that allows multiple directions to be used. It&amp;rsquo;s like vector movement but without acceleration. Unlike Onager, Vault only works well on a square grid, as jumping directions are difficult to visualize in a hexagonal grid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MATERIAL&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- A square grid with an even number of cells (recommended 10x10). Preferably checkered* for clarity, but this is not mandatory.&amp;#10;- As many white and black pawns as the number of cells per side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SETUP&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has an allocated colour (Black or White). Fill your nearest row with pawns of your colour (one per cell).&amp;#10; HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;White starts. Players alternate turns during the game until the victory condition is reached. On your turn, either walk or jump with one of your pawns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Walk&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Move one of your pieces to an adjacent empty space as a King in Chess.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jump&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to jump, choose 2 friendly pieces. One of the pieces then jumps over the other piece in the direction defined by both pawns, landing on a space beyond that is at a distance equal to the distance between the two friendly pieces before the jump was made (like a mirror). Notice that jumping is not restricted to orthogonal or diagonal directions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The landing space must be either empty or occupied by an enemy piece, which is then captured and removed from the game. A piece cannot land on a friendly piece. Pieces cannot land outside the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Notice that the spaces between the jumping pawn and the landing space don&amp;rsquo;t need to be empty. Also, captures can only be made by jumping.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME END&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If at the start of your turn you have at least one piece on your opponent's back rank then you have won.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the above condition is not reached and you can&amp;rsquo;t make a legal movement at the start of your turn, you lose. This rarely happens. Players may agree on a draw at any moment during the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;NOTES FROM THE DESIGNER&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is intended to be the simplest game that uses this jumping mechanism. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided not to use Onager&amp;rsquo;s stacking mechanism (in order to make is simpler for turn based online play and also playable with non-stacking pieces) or the multiple jump (as it would be almost impossible to think ahead).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a variant, you can use the stacking mechanism of Onager.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(*) On a checkered board, the jumping piece always lands in a space of the same colour as the starting one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
