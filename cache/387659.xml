						               													<description>Sunset Limited was released as one of six in Milton Bradley's &amp;quot;Radio Series&amp;quot; of inexpensive race games costing 15 cents each. It debuted in the Bradley Games catalog of 1927 and was sold through 1933. A slightly larger but cheaper edition, at 10 cents, appeared in the 1943 catalog.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a simple spin and move game in which a player wins by making a round trip, either to or from the &amp;quot;Golden Gate&amp;quot; at the center of the board and back again. The directions start with the following missive:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Every boy likes trains and engines and hopes some day to have an opportunity to ride in the cab, and perhaps pull the throttle of the great locomotive. In this game of Sunset Limited, each player represents an engineer striving to bring his train safely and &amp;quot;on time&amp;quot; to San Francisco, the City of the Golden Gate.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is suggested that if two players play, they may each wish to play with two &amp;quot;trains&amp;quot; (counters). If so, they only win by completing the round trip with both trains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
