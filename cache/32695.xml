						               													<description>From the rules: In brief the purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 48 states shown on the map of the United States as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Description from the rulebook:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Three hundred years ago the world powers were moving.  Far off to the west a great unknown wilderness was opening up. North America was being conquered and empires were being built.  Today in the game Conquest we re-enact the conquering of the continent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a game in which keen judgement interspersed with dashes of bluff and audacity mingle with lady luck to create a game that on one is out of until the last hand is played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 50 states shown as possible.  States must be conquered in the order listed under &amp;quot;Order of Conquest&amp;quot; shown on the game board and are also one of either four colors and have a number associated with victory points at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are four phases to the game - 1) Bidding your hand, 2)Marking of conquered territory and distribution of groups, 3)Dealing new cards, 4) Additional conquest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the bidding phase, players bid on their hand of five cards. First player is to the right of the dealer and then in subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand starts the bid.  Starting player places a bid.  Bids cannot be higher than $5 million.  The remaining players can either pass, meet the bid or raise the bid.  Winning hands are determined in order of winning hierarchy: Single: Highest single card of color called for; Doubles: Two matching number cards, one in the color being called; Triples: Three matching number cards, one in the color being called; Sweep: All four cards of the same number.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second phase, the winner of the hand takes all money bid and places one of their markers on the state or states conquered, receiving the number of regiments of troops as indicated on the conquered state.  5 regiments = 1 division.  Only divisions can be placed on the maps in any territories the players owns. Players may redistribute any troops that he possesses for the purposes of defense or offense. Players can also purchase additional troops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the third phase, the dealers asks if everyone is ready for the deal.  The dealer hands out enough cards to bring all players hands up to five cards. If a player receives a money card they can immediately turn the card in to collect the cash and gets another card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the final phase, players may conquer states of their opponents. Starting with the player who won the last hand states can be conquered via the following rules: 1)State must adjoin the territory of conqueror and belong to an opponent 2) Must have more troop divisions that place being conquered 3) Player must pay bank sum of 10 million plus 5 million for every divsion that opponent has in the conquered territory (Max 40 million) 4) Only one state can be conquered per hand 5) Conquered troops are returned to opponent and 6) if conquests results in a complete territory being possessed than additional troops are obtained for the district.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To conclude the game: After all states have been conquered there is a final phase of general conquest until no one has any resources left to conquer with.  The winner is the player having the highest score by totaling the victory points associated with the states conquered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
