						               													<description>Competitive zombie-themed card game where 3 to 5 players pass through places taken by the living dead trying to survive and fulfill the game's objectives to achieve victory. Each player chooses a survivor with different characteristics and receives at the beginning of the game a goal that is inspired by several films of the genre.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, players face the undead with the roll of the dice that is also used to activate cards that can be used both for combat and to help them fulfill their secret objectives and win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other locations can enter play, symbolizing the path taken by the survivors. The entire turn, players draw a survivor card, which can be actions or equipment (simplifying), and also draw a zombie card, which can be the undead themselves, or some negative event that occurs on the turn. Drawing zombies always stay in the same location, affecting all players who are there. For this reason the more people in the same place, the more dangerous it becomes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The combat in the game is performed with the dice roll, where the result is added to the survivor's equipment and skills. Zombies don't roll damage, but they get a bonus for quantity, the more zombies, the more difficult it is. When there is no way to fight the survivors can always escape, which is done in a similar way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win the game they must fulfill their objective cards, which have three tasks each. These activities can be killing a certain number of zombies, being in a certain place or having an item. Each objective is different and they follow a short narrative present in the cards. With the three tasks completed, the game is won, if the survivor manages to stay alive until the end of his turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Journey Z is a game with a lot of interaction between players, and this can be directly or indirectly, as two people in the same place, even just interacting with the zombies, can completely change the other's plans. Manipulate the result of the die roll, or use cards to gain advantages in confrontations with the undead, but the main thing is to be aware of your victory conditions and know how to use your resources to reach it as quickly as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;'-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
