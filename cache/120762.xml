						               													<description>Poptrix is an abstract strategy game for two players that is played on a 5x6 board. Each player is given one monocolored stash of pyramids. Players start on opposite short sides of the board. On the first turn of the game, each player places a pyramid of any size in his or her starting row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then take turns either launching a new pyramid or attacking. New pyramids are launched from existing pyramids and land up to two spaces away. Launched pyramids must be a different size than the launcher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If it is possible for one of a player's pyramids to attack, that player must make an attack. Pyramids of different sizes attack differently and have different strengths. Pyramids are removed from the game when defeated. Victorious pyramids have a cap placed on them that gives them a bonus is combat. Each player only has one cap. The cap is moved around as pyramids win or are defeated in combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players continue to launch pyramids and attack until all pyramids have been launched and no further attacks are possible. The player with the most pyramids on the board at this time wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
