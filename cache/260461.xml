						               													<description>Ransom City is no more. What was once a thriving metropolis, turned crime-ridden warzone, is now little more than rubble. A missile strike from an unknown origin preceded the Aftershock&amp;mdash;which is what the aftermath came to be known as. Almost half the city was wiped out by the missile, those that survived emerged from the destruction to be greeted by VANDAL fumes; a chemical-based mutagen that had various effects on its subjects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The government has been massively destabilized due to the Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s nefarious activities, and the survivors of Ransom City are left to fend for themselves in their hostile new home. Criminals re-emerged to claim dominance over the remaining resources, while the pharmaceutical giant Parasol Incorporated publicly announced their intention to lead cleanup efforts in Ransom City.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unfortunately, the corporation's interests seem skewed, and since their arrival many things have gotten worse. Including the arrival of strange mutated lab experiments and what could only be described as monsters straight out of horror movies&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aftershock is a deluxe expansion for the Street Masters board game, adding four new fighter decks, four new stage decks, two new enemy decks, new loot cards, and much more! Expanding on the modular nature of Street Masters, Aftershock includes two new ways to customize your play experience: missions and showdowns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The mission deck is included to speed up multiplayer games by adding additional ways to support your fellow fighters. Mission cards allow fighters to gain powerful mission tokens, that can in turn be used to assist your fellow fighters during their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Showdowns are a new type of story deck that can be used in any story mode game, adding a villainous character working in the shadows against the fighters. Each showdown deck introduces a unique story for the associated enemy deck, as well as upgrade cards that will truly test the fighters! Players can also choose to include these enemy upgrade cards in their arcade games to increase difficulty and customize their games even further.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, Aftershock comes packed in a massive storage box that is designed to hold all existing Street Masters decks and tokens, as well as room for future content.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
