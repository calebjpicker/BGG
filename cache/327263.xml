						               													<description>Doctor Li Wenliang tried to warn us of the danger of a new virus. Sadly, he died of COVID-19 himself before the world realized he was sounding the alarm of an impending pandemic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the card game Doctor Li, the corona virus is spreading at a threatening pace all over the world. Two to five players do everything they can to keep the curve of their land flat with good preparations and thus avoid a high death toll.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To do this, they collect sufficient hospital capacity, effective leadership and social distance. But beware, while there are some benefits to be gained from a creative and benevolent population, there are also numerous aggravating circumstances lurking. Hoarding behavior and a new wave are never far away, while government leaders of all kinds are looking for ways to deal with this crisis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with 4 category cards in his hand. The player with a date of birth closest to November 17 (when the first case of Corona was discovered) gets to start.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal of the game&amp;#10; The last round of the game is played when 1 player has completed all three categories. All other players may then play 1 more turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player can discard a category when he has at least 3 unique cards of 1 specific category that the player can put down in 1 turn. This can be a category of 3 or 4 unique cards. The missing unique card in a category of 3 cannot be added later in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the last round is played, the points are counted:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     1 point for each 3-card category discarded,&amp;#10;     2 points for each category of 4 cards discarded&amp;#10;     1 bonus point for the player who is the first to complete all three categories. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the highest score wins. If there is a tie, the player who finished first wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How does a round go&amp;#10; 1. The player takes the top card from the category pile or the top card from the category discard pile and takes it into his / her hand without showing the others the card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. The player then takes the top card from the action card pile and places it face up on the discard pile, visible to all players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     If the card has a logo in the top left corner, the player picks up the card in his / her hand and may play during this or subsequent turns.&amp;#10;     If the card is an 'aggravating circumstance' or 'a boost', the consequences will apply immediately and only to the player who turned the card.&amp;#10;     If the card is a &amp;quot;hamster&amp;quot; card or &amp;quot;a new wave&amp;quot;, the card applies to all players and all players must react immediately so as not to be affected by the card (see chart types overview). &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. A player now has the chance to play the remaining cards from his / her hand, or to discard categories.&amp;#10;When the player tries to discard a category, any other player can now play a 'Trump' card that forces the active player to discard any card of the hand played and take the remaining cards back into hand. Unless the active player can supplement the category with other cards from his / her hand OR plays another 'Trump' card that destroys the previous card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. If there are no more players who wish to play additional 'Trump' cards and the category is still complete, then the category is now considered 'discarded' and cannot be removed for the remainder of the game unless there is an 'I don't think so' card is played. The next player can now start his / her turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
