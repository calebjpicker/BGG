						               													<description>This Expansion Pack continues the story from the Treasure of Montecristo Island base game. With the altars still built and lit, the monks of the island disclose that gold is not the only treasure there. The Thief, now a character of their own, has a newly inspired thirst for besting your crew.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Included in this chapter is a host of tools at the Thief&amp;rsquo;s disposal; two sabotage tokens, a rope trap, poison, a bear trap, and a kidnap token.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dear Adventurers,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a Thief on the Island of Montecristo and they have targeted your band of Adventurers. Recognized only by a tattoo of a skull and snake and a scar across one eye, this thief is known throughout the lands for being equally resourceful and greedy. They are a master of crafting traps that will hinder your quest to discover the secret of Montecristo Island.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After failing to steal the first Treasure of Montecristo Island from you, the Thief is doubling their efforts. They will stop at nothing to obtain the Purple Sapphire and escape the island with this priceless gem.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Thief&amp;rsquo;s ship was previously damaged while attempting a stealthy approach, so, to complicate matters they will also rob you and your team for resources in order to repair their ship. Once the Thief has repaired their ship, there is nothing to stop them from stealing this new treasure and disappearing into the horizon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the Thief successfully repairs their ship and returns to it with the treasure, the game is over and the Thief is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
