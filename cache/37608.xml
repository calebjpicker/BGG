						               													<description>Mingle - Dice of Diction&amp;#10;Dice of Diction is the slogan that appears on the box top of this made-in-Malaysia letter-dice game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game comes with 8 letter-dice, each letter having its own point-score indicated next to it. There is also a 3-minute sand-timer and a pad of scoring diagrams for players to use.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two games may be played with this set (and one of these two games may itself be played in two ways).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mingle-Crossword makes use of the scoring diagram - each player gets one sheet of score pad with a 17 X 17 square grid on it (and space for writing down the scores). Each turn, the 8 dice are cast and the timer started. Players then have until the timer runs out to form a word using two or more of the eight letters showing. This first word must cover the centre square. Play continues, with each player forming words that intersect crossword-style with existing words on their own diagram. The diagram contains shaded squares that when used result in double or quadruple letter scores or double or quadruple word scores. After a fixed number of words (say 25), players total up their scores and the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mingle-Listing is simply a game of anagramming letters that come up on the eight dice when thrown. The first way to play is simply to throw the dice, set the timer going and for each player to list out as many words as he/she can. The player who lists the most words, wins. The second way of playing is to have players take turns to state a new word that can be formed from the dice. When a player cannot state a new word, he/she loses and drops out. The remaining players cast the dice again and play continues until only one player remains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is probably no longer in print as it is not mentioned in SPM's current website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
