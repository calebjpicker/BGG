						               													<description>As described on the box, Vir Sivir's Ramayana - The Game is played to find Rama using the locations of the Ramayana epic on a map of India. The purpose of the game is to allow the player to learn and understand the Ramayana in an easier format. The game can also be played at three different difficulty levels based on the player's gaming abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game play in general will have the players starting in different locations in India. They will have event cards that each represent an event that happens to Rama, and the location that they occurred in. Players will roll a special pair of dice to determine where on the board they can movie. Depending on the roll and the space they are on, they may also be able to draw special boon cards. Once a player is in one of the map locations, they may discard one event card corresponding to that location, and can play more than one event if they also discard a boon. Players who previously played an event card at the same location must pick their cards back up, but can avoid this by playing a boon. The first player to discard all of their cards is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The higher levels of game play will introduce a mystery event, where players have to deduce the mystery event by noting which events other players have played. Players also may ask the other players if they have event cards corresponding to the locations they are on to place in front of themselves. Once a player has seven event cards in front of them, they may see if they've correctly deduced the card...either winning the game, or being eliminated/receiving penalties. Boon cards now also have added abilities that will allow players to block paths of movement on the board, prevent players from asking for others' cards, or blocking others' card abilities. Players must also now discard boon cards as an entry fee into the event locations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The highest level of game play also introduces the Kodanda spinner (named after Rama's legendary bow). Each player will be designated as day, night, or twilight depending on their start space. The spinner must be spun at the start of each turn, changing the balance of power for each player, allowing them to roll an extra die or collect extra boons, or causing them to roll one less die and being unable to collect boons or even reveal their mystery event deduction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
