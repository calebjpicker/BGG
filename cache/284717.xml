						               													<description>Lead the people of one of the four towns in a post-apocalyptic world. Complete secret objectives and compete against other players, for example find the Patient Zero, take him to the Research Center and save the world while making sure your citizens don't get infected and turn Zombie. Or intentionally get some of your people infected and direct a zombie herd to your opponents&amp;rsquo; towns to disrupt their plans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this roll and move game there are 5 secret missions that are given out randomly among the 2 - 4 players.  Each player will try and accomplish their mission to win all the while trying to prevent being turned into a zombie.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE MECHANICS:  a turn consists of 3-Steps: Produce (rolling a pair of dice), Move (up to 3 movements of 1 hex (w/an exception of the type of piece being moved), and Attack (either zombies in the area or other players).  These actions must be done in this order.   UNLESS a 7 is rolled, then infection spreads fast and pieces on the board, depending on their location, might turn into zombies and players lose control of their pieces in this event.  These mechanics will be repeated until a player accomplishes their secret mission or all players have turned into zombies at which point everyone loses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE AREA BOARD:  A 12 X 12 hexagonal grid with each hexagonal space representing different topographies and symbols that provide provide benefits or introduce restrictions.  The board is also marked with grid areas designating areas of cities and buildings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY:  All of the areas and hexagonal spaces of the board are utilized in conjunction with the secret missions.  Upon roll of the dice, the production phase begins and players decide on their tactics according to the secret mission they were given at the start of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ATTACKS:   Attacks are optional and are resolved by dice role.  Depending on the number of units (maximum of three), dice are rolled and an attacking roll of 4, 5 or 6 is considered a hit while a 6 rolled by the defender is considered a successful defense with the defender winning any ties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE GOAL:  Avoid being annihilated by other players or turned into a zombie and be the first to complete your secret mission.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
