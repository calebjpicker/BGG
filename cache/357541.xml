						               													<description>Two chapters await in this brand new adventure.  Your arch-enemy is up to no good again&amp;hellip; This time, he has gone back in time and nabbed a bunch of extinct creatures and has opened one of the most exciting theme parks in the world&amp;hellip;Ice Age Park.  Messing around with time is exactly what you are trying to avoid, so of course you have been sent to the Grand Opening to check it out.  After all&amp;hellip; who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to play with a baby mammoth?  It becomes immediately apparent that some corners were cut with security.  Stranded in the middle of a zoo in lockdown, you need to match your wits against mother nature to escape with your very lives!  The ice below your feet is cracking, a rhino stampede has taken out the gift shop, and an out of control hot air balloon drifts into the heavens&amp;hellip; but nothing compares to the feeling of being hunted.  The saber-tooth cats are loose and they are hungry.  Fast and cunning, they are hot on your trail and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be around when they catch up.  Solve the puzzles, crack the codes, and uncover the secrets to get the park back online&amp;hellip; and to avoid the jaws of defeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;About Escape the Crate escape room boxes:&amp;#10;Each box has over a dozen unique puzzles which all fit the theme. Every item in the box has a purpose and will help you escape in time. Clue are hidden everywhere and in this game you need to think inside the box. Each box is a complete story.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These missions can be challenging and it is very possible you won't escape before the time limit. You can always reset the game using our instructions or you can continue playing past the time limit to see the mission to completion.&amp;#10;Every challenge you will face will have a set of hints, which you can choose to reveal when your team needs them. If you are completely stumped, even after the hints, the solution is also provided.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: You will need a fully charged computer or mobile device to play this escape room.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
