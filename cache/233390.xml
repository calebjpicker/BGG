						               													<description>Description from the designer:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Arranged! is a game that forces participants to confront the struggles of an arranged marriage and other South-Asian norms such as skin whitening, secret boyfriends, and dowries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are three female protagonists and one &amp;ldquo;Rishta Aunty&amp;rdquo; (i.e, the matchmaker) &amp;#10;The Aunties goal is to get all the girls married off. She moves closer to them as she learns about things such as their ability to cook, the amount of dowry they&amp;rsquo;ll bring in and whether or not they have &amp;ldquo;child bearing hips&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The girls spend their time coming up with creative ways to avoid getting hitched by the aunty. They can do so by talking about having a career, gaining weight, being seen in the mall with boys, or several other things that every other society would consider normal, but are seen as disgraceful in South Asian culture. &amp;#10;Occasionally, they might find out things about the aunty, such as the fact that she has a 23 year old unmarried daughter, and use that to blackmail her into moving away from them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At some point during the game, the Aunty comes across the Golden Boy. The green-eyed, light skinned, CEO of a business with a foreign passport. This is when the entire game dynamic switches around, as it turns into a rat race to get married to the dreamy Mr. Right. &amp;#10;The girls then start to make their way towards the aunty by flaunting their talents, such as the fact that they pray 5 times a day, or only have female friends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Only one girl makes it in time to marry this Golden Boy, and the rest are hitched off to the mama&amp;rsquo;s boys and womanisers who believe that they&amp;rsquo;re God&amp;rsquo;s gift to humanity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
