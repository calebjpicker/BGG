						               													<description>The figures (ships) may be moved back and forth on the lines from space to space. Crossing spaces can be moved forwards and backwards in all directions, but only to the next space.&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, each party has to occupy their own ports and those of their colonies with at least one of their own ships. The ports of all states not involved in the game are neutral and may not be stormed by the warring factions, but can be occupied by any faction. The parties set up their remaining ships step by step. When all access lines to an enemy port are closed, it is said to be blocked. If the opponent manages to encircle enemy ships, these encircled ships are also considered captured and are eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;If a party has occupied the 5 nearest spaces in front of an enemy port, the port is considered captured and the ship in the port must be eliminated from the game and the besieging party must occupy the captured port.&amp;#10;A game is over when you manage to occupy at least two-thirds of all your opponent's ports, or when you have taken three quarters of your opponent's ships, or you have surrounded him so that he can no longer move.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
