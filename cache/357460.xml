						               													<description>The personal branding game, MY BRAND, is developed based on the 5-personality type of 'CEO Brand Big 5'. This theory is based on the &amp;quot;Brand Personality Big 5&amp;quot;, developed by Professor Jennifer Aaker of Standford University.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players become brand managers, and through three consecutive games that they will play, they will help others and themselves to learn about their current brands and the brands that they are to persue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 1&amp;#10;Each player is dealt with 8 brand cards. &amp;#10;Pick a card from the hand and introduce themselves using the brand card.&amp;#10;Players vote two players who presented the best.&amp;#10;Take the card and make your personal 'Brand Archive' pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 2 &amp;#10;Each player is dealt with 8 brand cards. &amp;#10;Pick two card from the hand and open them on the table. &amp;#10;Then players tell stories about the strengths they have. &amp;#10;The other players offer each narrator a card from their hands.&amp;#10;The narrator takes two cards among them. &amp;#10;Send those two cards along with two other cards you previously places on the table to your 'Brand Archive'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 3&amp;#10;Each player is dealt with 8 brand cards. &amp;#10;Players take turn become a presenter. The presenter opens a Question card. &amp;#10;Question cards have questions like: &amp;#10;'What is the cover of your autobiography that you've published 20 years later like?'&amp;#10;'What is the feed you are uploading, 5 years later, as a social media influencer like?&amp;#10;All players place a card face-down. The presenter gather the cards from the other players and add more card from the deck to make a total of 7 Brand cards. Shuffle them and open those cards in a single line. &amp;#10;Players secretly select two cards they think most accurately represent the presenter related to the question. &amp;#10;Then place tokens on those two cards. If more than two players selected the same cards, those players each gain points as many as the number of tokens on it. &amp;#10;Sent three cards which have the most vote along with your own card to your 'Brand Archive.'&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players gain points as they play each game, they get points from the vote they get and the cards selected by other players, etc. Whoever has the highest score after three games becomes the best brand manager and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the game, you can examine and draw your brand in graph at the back of your sheet. &amp;#10;It will visually tell you your current brand and the brand to pursue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
