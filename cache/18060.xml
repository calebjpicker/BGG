						               													<description>In Magnetic Dimensions you get a Magnetic Hexagon shaped board, 106 magnetic pieces with 9 different shapes and sizes.  The pieces are reversible and therefor give you 212 total pieces. The board is shaped like a hexagon and has reversible game pieces in nine different shapes. The game also comes with stylus with different ends to use as a placement and removal tool, a rulebook and Finally, you get an easel and a picture hanger to display your masterpiece after you have finished playing the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game basis itself on the saying of &amp;quot;Is Magnetic Dimensions a game or is it art?&amp;quot;  The answer in the manual to both of these questions is an unequivocal yes.  Although in the rule book there are lots of options on how to play the game, it leaves it as an open form.  You basically first take a piece and place it on the game board, and subsequently add another piece, then another and so on, until you have created your own design, or one of the shapes/designs shown in the Game manual.  A Magnetic dimensions game takes as long as you need to create your picture through the use of all or some of the pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Primarily the game is designed for one player, however there are several options/ideas for a 2 player game.  For a two player version of the game you can allocate a certain number of pieces to each player, and then give a time limit on building something using opposite sides of the gaming board.  Or you can have one design built, and then the other player tries to build it in the same amount of time or less.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has limitless options, and is a fun and relaxing game, as you create and challenge yourself within the game.  You will see that there are many unique and very complicated ways you can create.  This game has thousands of options that make players get deeply involved consumed by it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end you will have to ask yourself... &amp;quot;Is it a game or is it Art?&amp;quot;  In the end it really is both!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
