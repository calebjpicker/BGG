						               													<description>The Battle of First Kernstown, March 23rd 1862.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jackson moves against a force he supposes he outnumbers and is defeated at Kernstown.  The defeat causes the US to not pull forces from the Valley to reinforce McClellan at Richmond, so, in the end, it's a strategic victory for the Confederacy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On March 24th 1864, Early on his way to Winchester meets Crook's Army of West Virginia at Kernstown, defeats him, and the Federals retreat across the Potomac as Early launches his raid to Chambersburg PA.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both battles use simple victory-points for elimination to determine who wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Last Full Measure is a free print-and-play game system of battles of the American Civil War. Kernstown is the twelfth battle in the system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A brigade scale game that uses regiment counters, as opposed to generic line markers, to spread the brigade over multiple hexes according to its size. Ranged artillery fire, cavalry charges, command and control, all in only eight pages of rules. Play aids include Player-aid card with CRT and other charts and tables; Eliminated Units card, 2 Order of Arrival cards, 307 2-sided counters, and a Battle/Scenario booklet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kernstown's Battle Book includes Set-ups for both the 1862 and 1864 battles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The map measures 18&amp;quot; x 23&amp;quot; at a scale of 250 yards per 3/4&amp;quot; hex.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
