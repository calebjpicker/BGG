						               													<description>Theme - Shine is a biblically based deck building game. In Shine, you are a person who has recently become a Christian. Though saved and forgiven, you still struggle with sin. Your goal is to remove sin from your life and grow in spiritual maturity. To do this, you will spend time in God&amp;rsquo;s word, prayer, and use your spiritual gifts to minister to the lost and the hurting. It is not as easy as it seems. Satan prowls like a roaring lion. You will face various temptations, but through it all, God will never leave you or forsake you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game objective - The object of this game is to build a deck, called a Life Deck. This deck represents a player&amp;rsquo;s spiritual maturity. Each player starts off with spiritual fruit, and a lot of sin. As the game progresses, players try to remove sin from their life decks and gain various cards, including more spiritual fruit. Character cards that represent people in need and sets of fruit cards are worth victory points.  Sin cards are worth negative victory points. The player, with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play - As a player you have the choice to pray or to shine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you choose to pray, you start off by using one of your spiritual gifts. Spiritual gifts allow a player to gain a specific spiritual fruit card. There are 9 different kinds of fruit cards and they are the resource used in Shine to gain other cards. &amp;#10;- You may use the abilities on scripture cards that take effect during prayer. &amp;#10;- You may remove a card from your deck, usually sin. &amp;#10;- You may also place any number of cards from your hand into your discard pile. &amp;#10;- To conclude your turn you draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you choose to shine, you start by using one of your spiritual gifts. &amp;#10;- You may play and use the abilities on scripture cards and character cards that you gained during previous rounds. &amp;#10;- You may trade a fruit card with any card in the fellowship pool. The fellowship pool allows players to trade fruit cards. &amp;#10;- You may trade in 2 fruit cards to gain a new fruit card. When you trade in a card it is removed from your deck.&amp;#10;- You may play fruit cards to gain new scripture and character cards.&amp;#10;- To conclude your turn draw cards until you have 7 cards in your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player draws the last card from their life deck, the current round ends. &amp;#10;- Each player shuffles their discarded life cards and places them under their life decks.&amp;#10;- Then each player draws the top card of their temptation deck and does what it says. Temptation cards force the player to draw more sin cards and have stronger effects if a player has sin that they have not dealt with.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when all of the temptation cards have been drawn. Character cards and full sets of 9 fruit cards are worth positive victory points and sin cards are worth negative victory points. The player with the most victory points is considered to be the most spiritually mature and is declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
