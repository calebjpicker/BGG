						               													<description>Revolution: State of War is a 2 player asymmetric military strategy on the Armed struggle for American Independence.  The primary objective is to establish and maintain the support of the population for your cause, but to do so often requires one to have control or possession of the territory where people live, and for that one must take command of your nation's forces, maneuver and engage in battles to secure the colonies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both sides have very unique and distinct advantages.  The British with their professional force and naval prowess can dominate coastal positions, but may have some difficulty when getting too far away from their coastal bases.  They know the longer the war drags on the more chances Americans will have to secure French support along with building up their forces to a higher standard.  As such, the British will want to hit the ground running and maintain the pressure, seeking out engagement after engagement to decimate the rebel forces so when they are better trained it will be immaterial at that point, or a day late and a dollar short.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The American's on the other hand need time to secure an alliance with the French and convert this rag-tag band of revolutionaries into a professional army to really flip the script but one doesn't always get the army they want, when they need it and have to fight with the army they have.  As such, to buy time and save face with the population the American forces will need to make the British advance as costly as possible by occupying advantageous terrain, leveraging the support of the population with Militia forces, and knowing when to simply run away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game incorporates cards but is not a card driven game, the cards provide enhancements and bonus abilities as well as enable deception actions that can really through a wrench in the works for your opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When forces contest territory on the Game Board, the game zooms in to a unique battle sequence, which is a mini-game itself; units deploy into lanes of combat and roll dice to score hits and kills with bonuses and enhancements for aspects like rout, exposed flank (enfilade), and Dragoon Charge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you lead your nations forces to victory?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
