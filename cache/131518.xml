						               													<description>Dominion of the Gods is a tactical miniatures game played on a board created by the players. The players buy, assemble and paint miniatures for use with the game. The miniatures come with stat cards, these stats will also be available in a rulebook. The stat card tells the player how far the model can move, how many dice it uses to attack, how many dice it gets while defending, how far its combat reach is how many hits the model can sustain before being removed from gameplay as dead and the level of faith it has in its God.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monsters, heroes, and gods of different pantheons battle in a miniatures skirmish game. Intuitive dice-based combat.  Cards list what models can accomplish, and dice rolls determine hits and blocks. Rolling the power die in special situations can prevent un-blockable hits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start off by choosing a God from a pantheon to play as their main character. Players then decide on a point total for the game they want to play. Once the point total is decided, each player puts together an army with models (using the models point cost) that equal up to the point total decided by the players. Players can only use models from their chosen pantheon at this time. There is the possibility that some  pantheons may be able to benefit from rogue legends in the future. Players are allowed to select one coin that they possess to use during the game. Different coins will be manufactured with different abilities. Some coins will be standard while others will be collectible items sold only during certain times of the year or at specific locations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a God is killed during the game, the faith scores of all the models on that team are reduced making them more likely to fail psychology checks. If a God is the only model left on the board, the God loses the ability to use any influence. Influence is a score that tells a God how much magic he can use every round. When a God is left without followers, he loses his magic ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
