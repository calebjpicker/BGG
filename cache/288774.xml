						               													<description>This LGBTQ-themed board game features extensive information about LGBTQ culture and history with opportunities for players to share their own personal accomplishments and milestones. Players begin at the 'Bleak World' and by successfully answering a variety of challenges advance to the &amp;quot;Better, Rainbow world. The game includes the board, writing pads, pencils, pencil sharpener, dice, 8 color pawn options, a deck of approximately 500 prompt cards, and a 90-second sand timer.  Two dice are included, a six-sided die for games without a time limit, and a 12-sided one for players needing to complete the game in 40 minutes or under.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each roll of the die determines which challenge players will face, and when successful, the player rolls again to advance on their next turn.  If they don't succeed, they remain where they are and try that challenge again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 9 different spaces include 7 color-coded challenges, one challenge indicated by the 'lock and key' graphic, and one which includes all the colors so that players are free to choose which challenge they prefer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All players advance along the path of colored flags toward a better world. The the first to reach the 'better world' is presented with a challenge selected for them by the other players.  If they succeed, they win the game, if not, they move back the number of spaces shown on the die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The challenges include:&amp;#10;Red: Freehand - The player selects a prompt card and must draw a picture of the prompt. If other players can guess what it is, they succeed and advance. The player who correctly guesses moves forward (For example, draw 'Stonewall.)&amp;#10;Orange: You Can Quote Me - Another player selects the first Orange card in the deck and reads it aloud to the player being challenged.  It will be a quote from a public figure or celebrity, and the player must choose which of the two possible answers provided actually said those words. &amp;#10;Yellow: You've Got Talent - the player selects the first yellow card in the deck and must do a charade of the prompt until someone calls out the correct answer before the timer runs out. (For example, do a charade to communicate &amp;quot;Stonewall.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;Green: Just Between Us - The player selects the first green card and shares as much of a personal anecdote as they are comfortable doing.  For example, &amp;quot;Have you ever had a crush on your health care provider.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;Blue: You Think You Know Me - the player selects the first blue card from the deck and reads the prompt question.  Other players must predict how that player will answer.&amp;#10;Pink: Unpinkable - The player selects the first pink card from the deck and reads it aloud, following the instructions to advance or move back.  For example, &amp;quot;You are out with friends and suggest that you all put your phones away.  Move ahead six spaces.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;Purple: Did You Know That? - Another player reads aloud the multiple-choice question, and selecting the correct answer allows the player to advance on their next turn.&amp;#10;The Closet - Players landing in the closet must tell a coming out story before advancing.  They may 'come out' about whatever issue is safe and relevant to them, it does not have to be about sexual orientation. Some may come out about being vegan, agnostic, or straight.&amp;#10;The Rainbow: Rainbow Choice - The player is allowed to select their preferred challenge.&amp;#10;The Better World: In order to win the game, the player who lands here must succeed at the challenge selected by the other players. If they do, they win, if not, they must move back the number shown on their last toss of the die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
