						               													<description>The successful start-up founder Max Hubbard invited his school friends on a yacht trip. Everyone was reminiscing about old memories until the evening took a tragic turn. Max&amp;rsquo;s wife Eleanor suddenly disappeared without a trace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Max&amp;rsquo;s invitation to join him on a yacht trip came as a surprise. Your old circle from school hadn&amp;rsquo;t met up for two years. Since then, your lives had slowly drifted in different directions. The reunions had been less and less frequent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Max had rented a luxurious motor yacht, with its own captain and cook, and late in the afternoon the vessel left the harbor. Antonio, the chef, served a fantastic five-course dinner in the evening. The champagne corks popped and everybody raised a glass to good times in the past. Everyone had plenty of stories to tell.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But the trip took a dramatic turn in the course of the night. By the time Max went to bed at around midnight, his wife Ella had disappeared. Max alerted everyone, and you all searched the ship from stem to stern. At first everyone thought it was a prank. But when you found a pool of blood on deck, it was clear something bad must have happened.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Captain Steward has notified the police and Coast Guard, but there is little hope of finding Ella alive. Until the authorities arrive, you will have to solve the mystery by yourselves. What happened this evening? Has there been a murder on board?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What is a murder mystery game?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &amp;ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&amp;rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME CONTENT:&amp;#10;1 Game Manual, 7 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 7 name badges, 1 support code&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash; description from the publisher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
