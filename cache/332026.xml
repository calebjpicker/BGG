						               													<description>Note:  The mint tin edition has less cards and is only for 2-4 players while the standard edition is for 2-6 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You and your cohorts of crime have just pulled off the most successful bank heist of the century, including the theft of one of the world's most valuable diamonds. You must lay low for a week and guard your take; there's no honor amongst thieves here, and everyone wants the most they can get. Plus, rumors are there's a snake in your midst that might be out to get the prize jewel for themselves, and a rat could be trying to foil the whole operation.Each player will be dealt a random crew card to tell you what your part in this band of thieves is. These are not hidden from other players, since teamwork is dreamwork, after all. Each person brings their own unique talent, or specialty, to the crew, usable throughout the game. You will also be given a random role card, possibly giving you a secret double agent part to play. These should not be shared and will affect how you can win the game. There are four regular crew member cards, one snake card, and one rat card. As with any squad, the more people you bring in, the likelier it is to have defectors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played over the course of seven rounds, or days. Every day will begin with players taking turns to choose their actions for the day by placing a token on the box next to the action of their choice. For morning actions, you will use the numbers on your crew cards to determine turn order. After that, turn order is based on the last round's actions going from top to bottom on the action card in the center of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your goal, as the thief you are, is to hoodwink your way through the week, exchanging loot with players and the score to end up with the best take for yourself. Don't get too greedy, though! If you end up with more than the score, your zealousness will be shown, and the crew will take you out. The prized diamond is also supposed to be shared, so any crew member holding it at the end will mark you for an early demise, as well. Additionally, the bank loaded a tracker into the loot that will get you caught and disqualified if you're holding it at the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
