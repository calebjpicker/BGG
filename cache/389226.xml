						               													<description>The once-peaceful community we call home has fallen under the shadow of an evil force, and the courageous protectors who defended our town have set off on their own pursuits of fame and fortune. In their place, a band of unlikely heroes have emerged - the Small-Time Heroes. These are not your typical heroes, with bulging biceps and chiseled jawlines. No, these heroes are more like the underdogs, with quirky personalities and oddball skills.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this cooperative deck builder, you&amp;rsquo;ll take on the role of one of the Small-Time Heroes and work together to defend the town. With each battle, you&amp;rsquo;ll build up your deck of cards, choosing from a variety of cards that represent your hero&amp;rsquo;s unique abilities. As your power builds, you will defeat waves of minions and end with a final boss battle. Defeat the boss before they defeat you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play a one off session by battling through three waves of minions and a final boss or turn it into a campaign and battle through all 3 bosses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
