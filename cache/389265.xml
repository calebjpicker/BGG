Show your strategic and collaborative skills in Lost &amp;amp; Found, a historical strategy game of balance between community and family needs. Take on one of five roles in a struggle to address dilemmas, overcome crises, and avert disasters that threaten to destroy everything you know and love. Look out for your family, but be sure to collaborate with your neighbors as well. Any number of players can win, but if anyone goes destitute, everyone loses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This, the first edition of Lost &amp;amp; Found, explores how a code of law called Mishneh Torah addresses lost and found possessions. Written in the 12th century by Maimonides, a great physician, philosopher, Jewish scholar, and sage, the law gives guideposts for behavior, but you decide how to solve dilemmas. Explore the ways in which this medieval religious legal system helped to hold society together and keep neighbors cooperating with each other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Will you follow the laws of lost and found possessions? Will you break them? Will you go above and beyond the law? Find out in Lost &amp;amp; Found!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
