						               													<description>A card game for 2-3 players in which each player recruits a team of mutants for hire that use their powers and savvy marketing to achieve celebrity status and all the glory and riches they can get.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common deck comprising cards of four types: Heroes, Marketing, Missions and Powers.  Players share a common set of money tokens (MT) and fame tokens (FT)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 7 Phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Opportunity Phase: Draw 1 card and put it in your hand. You may draw extra cards, but first for each you must pay 1D6 MT or pass.  If you pass, you may draw no more cards. &amp;#10;     Recruitment Phase: You may put mutants (heroes) from your hand into play. To recruit a mutant you must first pay 1D6 MT.  If you choose not to, recruitment phase ends.  When you recruit a mutant, place his/her card face up in front of you and place 1 FT on it. &amp;#10;     Publicity Phase: You may attach marketing cards to your heroes. To attach a marketing card you must first pay 1D6 MT.  If you choose not to the publicity phase ends.  A mutant may not have more marketing cards attached than he or she has FT. &amp;#10;     Mission Phase: You may play 1 mission card from your hand. To go on the mission, you must have at least 1D6 heroes. If you do not, skip the rest of this phase. Roll 1D6. This is the Carnage roll. For each point of carnage, discard one power card from your hand. For each point of carnage not negated by a power card, kill off 1 random Hero of your Team. Gain 1D6 MT for each killed hero. If you have any surviving heroes roll 1D6. Add the number of survivors. This is the success roll. If the success roll is higher than the carnage roll, the mission is a success and you gain 2D6 MT.  You may discard power cards to add 1 to the success roll for each card discarded. All tokens and cards attached to a killed hero are discarded/lost with him. &amp;#10;     Fame Phase: Each of your Heroes that survived a mission last phase gains a FT. &amp;#10;     Fortune Phase: Gain 1 MT for each FT and marketing card you have in play. &amp;#10;     End Phase: Max hand size is 5 cards.  Discard excess cards. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player goes to start his turn, and there are no cards left in the deck. The player with the most MT at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
