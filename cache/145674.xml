						               													<description>The game has its players taking turn playing a Hero (Conan, Red Sonja, B&amp;ecirc;lit...). The rest of the players play Hero&amp;rsquo;s foes, fight a round of combat, and then the next player plays his Hero. Hence, only one player is playing a Hero at a time while the rest play his foes. If a player is playing Hero&amp;rsquo;s foes, their Hero is currently inactive and doesn&amp;rsquo;t factor into play. The Hero wins renown points by defeating his enemies. There are various victory conditions (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Hero, or the last player with cards left to play wins the game).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with one Hero card, a foe deck and a draw deck. Players randomly decide who will go first. That player becomes the active player, and places his Hero card in the center of the table and is considered to be playing the Hero. All players then draw cards form their draw deck and play begins. The Hero player then can place into play any allies and locations that he or she might have and also place items and weapons on his Hero card for use them in the upcoming combat. Whether or not cards can be placed into play depends on several factors, but the main mechanic for both foes and the Hero is their pool of prowess points. Most cards have a prowess cost that gets subtracted from this pool in order to place a card into play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then the foes draw from their foe deck a number of cards partly based upon how many much renown the Hero has. For every foe the Hero kills, that player places that foes card into the area known as the chronicle. Each foe has a renown score, and the total of all the felled&amp;rsquo; foes renown score in Conan&amp;rsquo;s chronicle is his renown score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The more defeated foes in a Hero's chronicle, the more foes the opposing player gets to put into play, i.e. the more famous the Hero gets, the more enemies want to take him down. Once the foe pool is drawn, the foe players then decide which of these foe cards they want to put into play. There are major and minor foes and rules governing how many foes from the foe draw can be put into play. Once the foes decide which of their foe cards they are able and want to play, they place their foe cards into 4 zones around the Hero(front, left, right and rear). They then place &amp;ldquo;move&amp;rdquo; cards from their draw deck for each foe they have assigned to do battle with the Hero. These cards are placed face down and represent both offensive and defensive elements. The Hero player then responds to these move cards with his own move cards, placed face up, to counter each foes&amp;rsquo; move card. Hero&amp;rsquo;s move cards also incorporate both offensive and defensive elements. The foes then reveal their move cards and combat is resolved. If any of the foes are left alive, all players draw cards from their draw deck, and the surviving foes place new move cards onto the table. The Hero once again counters, combat is resolved, etc. until either the Hero retreats or defeats all his foes. If the Hero retreats he loses renown. If he defeats all of his foes, the Hero then can decide to rest and replenish his prowess pool and a small fraction of his life points. The Hero can also &amp;ldquo;press on.&amp;rdquo; If the Hero presses on, he starts a new round of combat, but does not get to replenish any prowess or life. Once the Hero rests or retreats, the next player then becomes the Hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues until a victory condition is met (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Conan, or the last player with cards left to play).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player must provide two decks which meet the appropriate requirements. The Draw Deck must contain at least 40 non-foe cards. No more than 3 copies of any given card are allowed, with no more than 1 copy of any unique card. The Foe Deck must contain at least 25 foe cards. No more than 3 copies of any given foe card (or 1 copy of any unique card) are permitted. The total renown of the foes in the Foe Deck must total from 95 to 105 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hasta el momento han aparecido:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;01. Set B&amp;aacute;sico&amp;#10;02.
