						               													<description>Quarterback King is a board game which unites the sport of football and the game of chess into a fun, strategic game for two players. The game pieces are set-up in a traditional football formation, on a twenty-four square by ten square checkered football field board. The object of the game, like football, is to outscore the opponent. One player manages the offensive game pieces, trying to maneuver the quarterback towards the opponent&amp;rsquo;s end zone for a score (touchdown or field goal). The other player manages the defensive game pieces, trying to capture the quarterback or prevent its advancement toward the goal line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pieces are moved one at a time, similar to chess, beginning with the offensive team, then alternating to the defensive team. Each game piece is assigned a specific directional pattern of movement. Once a piece is captured it is removed from the game board. If the quarterback is captured, players switch roles, with the defensive team becoming the offensive team at the point of capture and vice versa. All pieces are returned to the board and play resumes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring: A touchdown is seven points; a field goal is three points; a safety is two points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Timing: The game is played in two halves or four fifteen minute quarters.  Each coach is allowed three timeouts per half.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play timing: The offensive coach has thirty seconds to move a piece.  The defensive coach has fifteen seconds to make a responding move, which makes for a fast-paced and pressure packed game of strategic fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This description is attributed to Cort Hubbard, the game designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
