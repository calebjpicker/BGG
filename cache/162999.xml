						               													<description>Object - To be the player with the most cards at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Deck &amp;ndash; 36 cards ranked from highest to lowest 14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6 each in four-color suits red, green, blue and orange.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the start of the game each player selects a different trump color suit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Deal &amp;ndash; The dealer shuffles the deck and deals out all the cards one at a time face down to all the players. Next players look at their hand for any sixes not in their trump suit, these are to be given to the player who has that suit as trumps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in three rounds; keep scores for each of the rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Play &amp;ndash; Playing clockwise, the player to the dealers left starts by playing any card from their hand face up to the center of the playing area forming the start of a play stack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Henceforth on your turn take one of the following actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Beat the top card of the play stack by playing a higher-ranking card of the same color suit or&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Play one of your trump cards on top of the play stack. Having done this, you must play another card on top of this one; this second card may be of any rank or color suit the player so chooses or&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Play a card that is not one of your trump cards to the playing area forming a second play stack adjacent to the previous one, the card must be of a different color suit from the one previously lead. Having done this, you must play another card on top of this one; this second card must be a higher-ranking card of the same color suit. Now all the cards of the previous play stack go to the previous player and kept face down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player is unable to take her turn, she must pass and the stack of cards go to the previous player. If all players pass in succession the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring &amp;ndash; At the end of each round add up all the cards you&amp;rsquo;ve taken, these are worth 1 point each and then subtract 1 point each for every card left in your hand. Tally each players final scores from all three rounds, the player with the highest score is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
