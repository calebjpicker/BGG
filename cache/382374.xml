						               													<description>&amp;#10;    Objective*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toast to the top with Toasty Toasts! Combine delicious Topping cards, use sneaky Actions, and create the tastiest Toasts spread to score the most points!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Setup*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Separate the Base Toast pile, Draw pile, and Time to Eat card.&amp;#10;Shuffle the Draw pile. &amp;#10;Deal each player two Base Toast cards and three cards from the Draw pile. &amp;#10;For two to three players, shuffle the Time to Eat card into the bottom 1/3 of the Draw pile. For four players, shuttle it into the bottom 1/4 of the Draw pile.&amp;#10;Place the Base Toast (faceup) and Draw piles within reach of all players.&amp;#10;Determine the starting player by selecting the player who last ate toast.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Gameplay Overview*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toasty Toasts is played over several turns, where each player may take a number of actions before passing the turn to the next player on their left (clockwise). Turns continue until the &amp;ldquo;Time to Eat!&amp;rdquo; card is drawn, at which point the game ends, and players proceed to the scoring phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Player Turns*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player turn can be split into three quick phases (Draw, Play, Hand Check).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Draw Phase*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The active player draws two cards from the Draw pile. If the active player has no cards in hand at the beginning of their turn, they instead draw three cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Play Phase*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the active player&amp;rsquo;s play phase, they may make up to two plays. A player may choose to pass at any time on their turn, as a result a player may make 0, 1, or 2 plays on their turn.  Most plays only require a single play. These include: &amp;#10;Playing a single topping or action card&amp;#10;Playing two cards as part of a matching or combination pair&amp;#10;Trading any two cards for a new Base Toast. &amp;#10;Additionally, Players may play Plain Toast cards in two different capacities&amp;mdash;as a Base Toast, or as a Sandwich.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Playing an Topping Card*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a single play, the active player may play a topping card face up on one of their Base Toast or Plain Toast cards. Toppings may not be placed on a Toast that already holds a topping if the topping does not: &amp;#10;a. Match the played topping&amp;#10;b. Combo with the played topping&amp;#10;A single Toast may hold any number of matching toppings, or toppings that combo with each other. Combo toppings do not require a direct 1:1 ratio of each topping to be placed on a Toast.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Playing an Action Card*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a single play, the active player may play an Action card. When playing an Action card, resolve the text printed on the card, then place the card into the discard pile.  &amp;#10;Playing Matching Topping Pairs&amp;#10;For a single play, the active player may play two matching toppings on a single toast.&amp;#10;As with single placement restrictions, the active player may not place a matching topping pair onto a toast which already holds one or more toppings that the played toppings do not match or form a combination with.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Playing a Combination Pair*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a single play, the active player may play two toppings on a single toast provided the toppings form a combination pair. Combination toppings share card color and are designated on each topping card. Combination pairs include:&amp;#10;- Peanut Butter &amp;amp; Jelly&amp;#10;- Bacon &amp;amp; Egg&amp;#10;- Tomato &amp;amp; Avocado&amp;#10;- Choco Spread &amp;amp; Banana&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As with single placement restrictions, the active player may not place a combination pair onto a toast which already holds a topping that is not part of the combination pair.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Trading for a Base Toast*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a single play, the active player may trade a combination of any two Toast, Topping, or Action cards in their hand for a Base Toast from the Base Toast pile. Base Toast cards are placed immediately in front of the active player next to their other Toasts.&amp;#10;-Note- This play may only be performed once per turn.&amp;#10;Playing a Plain Toast Card&amp;#10;Plain Toasts are unique in that they may be played in two different capacities: As a Base Toast or as part of a Sandwich.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    As a Base Toast*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a single action, the active player may place a Plain Toast card face up in front of them next to their other Toasts. Plain Toast cards played in this way are treated as if they were Base Toast cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    As a Sandwich*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For two actions, the active player may place a Plain Toast card on top of any of their other Toasts. Doing so changes the Toast into a Sandwich. Plain Toasts are the only cards that may be used to create sandwiches.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Sandwiches &amp;ndash; Important!*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a Toast becomes a Sandwich, additional toppings may not be added to it. However, it is also immune to the effects of all Action cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Hand Check*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the active player has completed two actions&amp;mdash;or passed&amp;mdash;they check their hand to ensure they have seven or fewer cards. Should their hand hold an excess of seven cards, the active player must place cards from their hand into the discard pile until their hand holds seven cards. &amp;#10;Play then passes to the player on the active player&amp;rsquo;s left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Game End*&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the &amp;ldquo;Time to Eat!&amp;rdquo; card is drawn, play ends immediately. &amp;#10;Each player counts their score using the following point structure:&amp;#10;- Base Toasts (exclude sandwiches) &amp;ndash; 1 point&amp;#10;- Single Toppings &amp;ndash; 2 points&amp;#10;- Sandwiches &amp;ndash; 3 points&amp;#10;- Combos &amp;ndash; 5 points&amp;#10;Note that all toppings that are part of a sandwich score their points normally&amp;mdash;whether they are single toppings or part of a combo, sandwich points are considered a bonus for converting a Toast into a Sandwich using a Plain Toast card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
