						               													<description>INTRO:&amp;#10;Beekeeper is a family friendly game for children and adults to enjoy. The game consists of 37 Hexagonal Playing Pieces, 1 set of instructions and a nice Black Cloth Pouch w/ drawstrings to hold all the pieces! Set-up time is approx. 2-3 minutes with playtime amounting to 5-10 minutes, and this game can be played with up to 6 players.&amp;#10; GAMEPLAY:&amp;#10;1st) dump out the hexagonal pieces onto your playing surface and find the queen chit (she has an image on each side of the chit so it should be easy to find her).&amp;#10;2nd)Place the queen in the middle of the playing surface.&amp;#10;3rd)Arrange the rest of the pieces (beekeeper logo side facing up) around the queen piece until you have 3 rows around the queen. (The playing surface should resemble a giant hexagonal shape, or honeycomb)&amp;#10;4th) Youngest player gets to go first by pulling 1 chit from the game (*NOTE* only pieces with 3 open sides can be removed from the arranged pieces).  He/She will then flip over the piece and find the following;&amp;#10;BEE POINTS:  These give you points to win the game&amp;#10;ANIMALS:  These guys make you lose turns&amp;#10;HONEY TOKENS: You need at least 6 honey tokens to pull the queen from her throne when she has at least 3 open sides and end the game and with her you get 10 bee points.&amp;#10;BEE NET or HONEY EXTRACTOR:  Use these cards once during gameplay to steal a bee chit or honey chit from an opposing player (once used they must be discarded to the side)&amp;#10;  Once the first player's turn is complete, then the person to the left is next to pull a piece from the hive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ENDING AND WINNING THE GAME:&amp;#10;  The game is ended when the Queen chit is removed from the playing surface, which can happen two ways;&amp;#10;  One way is if she has at least 3 open sides and someone has 6 or more HONEY TOKENS.&amp;#10;  The other way is if there are no more chits to pull from the game, then the queen is rewarded to the next player's turn.&amp;#10;  The game is won by the person with the most Bee Points, so count up all of your drones', larvas', workers' and queen bee's chit values and that will be your Bee Point count.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Norshanks Game Cause:&amp;#10; As with most of the games that Norshanks Games will be marketing, this game is tied to Beekeeping Associations in various countries, and every time a game is sold, part of the profits will be donated to the Purchaser's Current Country of Residence National Beekeeping Association.&amp;#10; The donated funds will go to the Beekeeping Associations to help save the bees by; researching colony collapse disorder, increasing bee populations, educating the public about the importance of bees, and many other great projects!&amp;#10; With your help we can help reverse the collapse of bee populations everywhere!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game is expected to be ready for shipment in Winter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
