						               													<description>The players choose a game master (traffic inspector) to monitor the exact observance of all traffic rules during the game. He notes the number of moves drawn and the number of penalties for each player. He manages the till. &amp;#10;One half of the tokens goes into the cashbox, the other half is distributed evenly to the players.&amp;#10;At the start of the game, the traffic signs should now be placed on the empty, white circles. The game master shows the players one sign after the other and the players place them on the appropriate place according to the landscape of the game board. If a player gets it wrong, he pays a token into the till and the next player must now indicate the correct place, etc. If the answer is correct, the player receives a token from the till. If someone violates the same sign the second time, he pays 2 tokens, the third time 3 tokens, etc.&amp;#10;Each player places his figure on his starting space S in the color of his own vehicle (car, truck, racing car or motorbike). Each player has to get to his destination Z (which again has the color of the vehicle). He is free to choose his path. &amp;#10;All players always make a move one after the other. The streets are divided into equal spaces. Each space means one turn at a driving speed of 30 km/h. This is the initial speed for each vehicle. On the second move the vehicle may go to the next higher speed of 60 km/h. Each vehicle may increases its speed by a further 30 km each time it moves up to its specified maximum speed (truck 60km/h, motorbike 90 km/h, car 120 km/h, racing car  150 kn/h). This rule is interrupted immediately if the vehicle comes to a road obstacle, which is indicated by a traffic sign. Such a sign forces the player to drive more slowly or even to stop or turn around.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whoever gets to their goal Z in the shortest time - i.e. with the fewest moves - and with the fewest penalty points and the most money is the winner. If two players arrive at the same time, the number of penalty points and the money decides. The winner receives half the till as a prize. Only the driver who gets to his destination in 35 moves without making any mistakes, becomes the champion driver. He wins the title and in this case the whole till.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
