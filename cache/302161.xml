						               													<description>For King or Country is a cooperative based game in which players work together as Members of Parliament to enact a velvet revolution in their country, peacefully overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a fully fledged democracy. Like in any government, corruption and self interest make getting things done nearly impossible. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the player to navigate the political landscape keeping the people, the military, the monarch, and others happy while they pursue their goals. By passing and amending legislation, players can change the very makeup of the game, making it easier or more difficult to meet their ultimate end goal.&amp;#10;   &amp;#10;     The main venue of participation players can make it through using MP Cards. MP Cards come in three varieties: Actions, Amendments, and Events. Actions can be played at any time to win over MPs from across the aisle, help more of your party members get elected, and even filibuster a bill you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pass. Amendments on the other hand are attached to a bill in question, only going into effect if it is passed by Parliament. Amendments could change the effects of a bill, alter the rules of the game, and even dish out some pork barrel spending to your constituents. The final type of MP Cards are Event, disastrous circumstances that affect whichever player has drawn the card. These Events can be from a crisis in your district, to an embarrassing scandal that ruins your reputation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
