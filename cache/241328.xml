						               													<description>Travel around the most beautiful places in XVIth century Europe with Montaigne!&amp;#10;In 1580 and 1581, Michel de Montaigne is travelling Europe on horseback. In a Travel journal, he writes of this extraordinary experience.&amp;#10;Become travelers and follow his steps around France, Germany, Switzerland or Italy, to discover countries through Montaigne&amp;rsquo;s eyes, meet people he encountered and think with his mind&amp;hellip; Until King Henri III calls you back to Bordeaux, as he did with Montaigne asking him to become the city&amp;rsquo;s mayor, then you will have to end your journey and go back to the South West of France as fast as you can.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a multi-purpose card game for 2 to 4 players from 8 years old.&amp;#10;The players manage their best hand cards they will pose in front of them, deploying the many discoveries of their trip (gastronomy, meetings, visits or reading the Montaigne books ...), while observing the choices of other players.&amp;#10;Voyages avec Montaigne offers many mechanics interlaced in a simple and fluid way. Opportunism, interaction and anticipation make the pleasure of a game that suddenly makes one of the greatest French writers of all time very close.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game Voyages avec Montaigne, players place cards face up next to the last card they placed, on a line from left to right. This line represents their journey.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn, players take turns with 1 action among 3 : &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Travel : place a card from a different city AND pay the cost of the travel (0, 1 or 2 cards discarded)&amp;#10;     Stay : placing a card of the same city AND pick 1 new card&amp;#10;     Get supplies : not placing a card AND pick  and 2 new cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can discard a figure met during his journey to take another action OR take a card from the discard pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2 travelling rules must be respected :&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     At the end of their journey, players must return to Bordeaux and have placed at least on &amp;laquo; Citation &amp;raquo; card form each of the 3 books of Montaigne&amp;#10;     Players cannot go back to a city they have already been.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During their journey, players take one of the Bonus tile available as soon as they reach the objective first or do better than a player who had already achieved the objective (5 discovery bonus, 4 book bonus).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the &amp;laquo; King&amp;rsquo;s call &amp;raquo; special card is revealed, all players must go back to Bordeaux as soon as possible, rules are thus modified :&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Action &amp;laquo; Stay &amp;raquo; is not allowed anymore&amp;#10;     Players cannot travel to a city that would take them further away from Bordeaux.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First players returning to Bordeaux get bonus, As soon as all players but one have returned to Bordeaux, the last player only has one turn left to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bonus tiles are awarded to players : most cities visited, the most different theme cards, the most different characters encountered, largest stay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
