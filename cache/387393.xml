						               													<description>Delvers of Eldrisar is a deckbuilding game focused on providing a deep strategic experience immersed in beautiful art while maintaining fast-paced and intuitive gameplay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Delvers of Eldrisar you take on the role of an ambitious warlock, kept alive long beyond your natural life by the power of your Essence Relics. Your goal is to conquer all of Eldrisar, but to do so you must eliminate any and all potential adversaries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts the game with a small deck of 10 cards, representing their current resources in Eldrisar. Players take turns, utilizing their Minions, Treasures and Incantations to build their decks and attack their opponent. The first player to capture all of their opponent&amp;rsquo;s Essence Relics is the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
