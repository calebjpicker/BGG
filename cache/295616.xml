						               													<description>A Luminous Flame in The Darkness (LFID) is innovative Board Game for sharing and learning. The LFID is Homemade Integrated Design. It is also suitable for a solo game at home.  The player can share and learn about ethic, goodness, moral, and core cultures while they adventure and explore with many experiences on the map of a community. Some happenings tend to be worse. How do they live? How do they make a decision? or How do they take an action?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Player can create Core Culture and a story together, including modify rules. In the game, the player may see a picture emerge of inter-relationships with multiple factors that are connected, such as causes that lead to multiple degenerations or the existence of individual forces against outer contexts. Preservation and recovery of life is more difficult than destruction. Creativity, life, people and the maintenance are essential for the existence of a core culture. The environment is not for the individual to exploit, but for all lives to enjoy.  This game simulates incidents happening in a world of fantasy in which virtue and ethics are crucial to the survival of humanity.  Each player will be able to perceive an overall concept of the core culture which they created together in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Note : In case of using for eduacional game, an experienced adult or parent is required to teach and guide.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BACKGROUND :&amp;#10;I graduated in Ph.D. of Arts and Culture Research from the Faculty of Fine Arts of Srinakarinwirot University in Bangkok, Thailand. My research of Green Culture for Ethics Through Documentary Films, found out the issues of many problems and wide ranging effects, including the realisation that the relationship between natures and ethics are complementary in both the individual and public contexts. The complimentary nature of living in accordance with an ecological system leads to a balance between the physical and subjective, the concrete and the abstract, human behaviour and the mind which can be seen as the foundation of ethics for peaceful and sustainable mutual living.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Game Story :&amp;#10;After humanity has destroyed nature and the environment in many areas, some of the areas have  been restored and rejuvenated. Nevertheless, many people turn to violence to hurt and destroy each other for fame and wealth, focusing on dominating the land which causes many problems and adverse living conditions.  People have lost trust for each other : no faithfulness exists. They have lived in unsafe place and lead insecure lives. At the same time that pollution has dominated and deterioration also spreads widely into several areas.  In one remote district, a city that was once full of happiness, many things have began to change. However, the last thing that still keeps faith and hope and that will not be destroyed so easily, the GOODNESS OF PEOPLE&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECTIVE&amp;#10;All players help most members in their community to stay away from evil power before most terrible things appear. They try to cultivate goodness and ethics in the land of loss before the darkness comes.  At the end of game, all players consider successful future and present outcomes together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GENRE&amp;#10;Fantasy game, &amp;#10;Solo Game,&amp;#10;Co-operative game, &amp;#10;Strategic game, &amp;#10;and Educational game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COMPONENTS&amp;#10;1. 16 Miniatures / 16 Character Markers&amp;#10;2. 3 Draw Bags&amp;#10;3. 12 Intelligence Dice&amp;#10;4. 12 Conscience Dice&amp;#10;5. 6 Open-Mind Dice&amp;#10;6. 8 Sincerity Dice&amp;#10;7. 12 Tolerance/Endurance Dice&amp;#10;8. 12 Evil Dominance Dice&amp;#10;9. 2 Protection Dice&amp;#10;10. 20 Moral Cards (5 Principles)&amp;#10;11. 47 Happening Cards&amp;#10;12. 4 Ending Cards&amp;#10;13. 6 Random Quality Cards&amp;#10;14. 76 Encounter Cards&amp;#10;15. 6 Item Cards&amp;#10;16. 15 Special Person Cards&amp;#10;17. 11 Monster Cards&amp;#10;18. 1 Devil Card&amp;#10;19. 5 Mechanical Move Cards&amp;#10;20. 59 Person Tokens&amp;#10;21. 89 Merit Tokens&amp;#10;22. 224.
