						               													<description>&amp;quot;We Let Your Dogs Out&amp;quot; is a card drafting game for 2 to 6 players where every player is the owner of a dog walking business hoping to be the highest rated gig in the city. During the game, you will hire 6 dog walkers and assign each of them a dog to walk. While the dogs are cute and cuddly, the dog walking business is ruff and far from friendly.&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#139;&amp;#10;Players will draft their dog walkers from hands that are passed around the table. Whomever you don't hire may end up working for your competition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whenever a walker takes a dog out for their afternoon stroll, the owner will leave a review on your website. The better the match, the better the review! Some owners primarily want an inexpensive option. Some dogs will only be happy with top shelf treats. Match up your walkers with dogs strategically to get the best ratings possible. The player with the highest online rating wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
