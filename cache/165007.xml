						               													<description>The game provides a unique experience for families. The challenge is adaptable to the players desire and can be played in Single or Cooperative mode.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE OBJECTIVE&amp;#10;In the begining of the game, players receive 4 objective cards of different type that indicate witch tokens they have to find (the tokens in the game setup are placed face down in random order) in the different game-boards. The 4 tokens must be found and placed on each player character sheet in order to a player (or players in coop mode) be able to chalenge the vilain in the end phase of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;To move around, in the begining of the turn, a player must take a random encounter card that tells wich character (good or bad) he encounters in his voyage. These cards must be resolved first according to the symbols printed on them. After this, each player moves its marker the number of spaces indicated on that same card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then explore the boards turning the tokens around and seeing what lies beneath, looking for their 4 objectives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hidden beneath the tokens may be be good things, objects or enemys. Players use the power of food and good nutrition to overcome obstacles trought matching food cards color sequences.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MEANWHILE&amp;#10;At the same time that players ares trying to find their objectives, the clock is ticking and they have only 10 rounds to prepare for the final battle against the bad guy....he has is hown character sheet that plays automatically against the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must find their objectives and at the same time try to find out the villains hidden location in the factory for the final battle, if they fail to do this, even if the their objectives are met, the bad guy wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE STORY&amp;#10;Our story takes place in a land called NUTRILAND, where food had enormous powers, called NUTRI-POWERS. People lived happily and had a healthy and balanced life. The big NUTRILAND FACTORY, managed by MURDOCH and a team of good nutritionists, led by NEUS, made &amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#139;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#139;the processing and distribution of food to the entire population.&amp;#10;ALEX GRAND, the terrible villain, seized control of his father&amp;rsquo;s factory with the help of NOSE, a despicable bootlicker and his right arm, and subverted MURDOCH&amp;rsquo;s dream using the Factory to produce and distribute GENEX-100, a caloric compound of his making.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before ALEX destroyed everything, NEUS instructed its seven most experienced nutritionists to flee, so that each one would preserve a food group. Thus they became Nutri-Masters and created the seven kingdoms of nutrition where even today they retain the foods that were entrusted to them and the secrets of their incredible NUTRI-POWERS.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;30 years later NUTRILAND became gray and entirely dominated by ALEX GRAND, which gave it a new name - GRANDLAND. The population forgot food over time and ALEX became an businessman adored by all and the GENEX-100 the only food available.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Having realized ALEX&amp;rsquo;s scheme, and having discovered the existence of food, TEO, LENA, BEN and NINA take on the exciting mission to discover the seven kingdoms of nutrition and restore food diversity to GRANDLAND.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
