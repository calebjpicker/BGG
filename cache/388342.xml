						               													<description>Ultra Quick Pro Basketball is really two games in one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We offer you the familiar method employed in Ultra Quick College Hoops, which resolves a game in two rolls of the dice, and a quarter-by-quarter method, which closely resembles the method employed in Ultra Quick Hockey.  The Quarter-by-Quarter method has provisions for &amp;quot;Big Games&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;Bad Games&amp;quot; and features a very unique and simple season normalization process.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We added the quarter-by quarter method as it provides a little more drama as the game unfolds, and only adds a slight bit of gaming time. The quarter-by-quarter method also allows you to play cross-era match-ups efficiently and accurately, with our season normalization ratings, so you can easily match-up teams from yesterday and today and get unbiased results.&amp;#10;Both methods are accurate and as the name implies, both methods play ultra-quick!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each season has ratings for both methods of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Printed game ships with the rules, charts, random number sheets and two six-sided dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;        To Play, a season yearbook is required**&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher's website&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
