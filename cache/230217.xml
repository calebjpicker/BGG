						               													<description>A card game for 2 players based on the Highlander Movies and TV shows. The game depicts two Immortals engaging in a duel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player picks a pre-made Immortal (from a choice of three) or makes their own by rolling dice for stats. Each Immortal has 12 basic stats: Wits, Will, Courage, Strength, Skill, Reflexes, Agility, Endurance, Initiative, Experience, Judgement and Size.  The average Immortal will have a score in each between 4 and 9. Each Immortal starts with a number of Life Points = 15 + Endurance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Immortals are armed with swords, and players can select from a choice of 9 different types.  Each sword has 5 stats: Sharpness, Impact, Speed, Guard and Length. These also have scores between 4 and 9.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common deck formed from 5 different cards types: Attack, Defence, Both (can be used for either Attack or Defence), State, Early Event Card and Late Event Card.  Combat cards (Attack, Defence or Both) generate the indicated amount of Force - this will usually be a number between 2 and 9. Some combat cards list their Force as a Stat (Immortal or Sword). In this case use your Immortal&amp;rsquo;s or sword&amp;rsquo;s stat value as that of the combat card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before combat players must chose a location (from a choice of 8). They can agree on one or choose randomly. Most locations will have special rules that modify the combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn has 7 Phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.   Draw Phase&amp;#10;-    Each player fills their hand to 5 cards.  If one Immortal has more Experience than his opponent, he fills his hand to 6 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.   Initiative Phase&amp;#10;-    Players roll one die each and add their Initiative Stat. The higher total wins the Initiative. If tied, roll again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3.   Early Event Phase&amp;#10;-    Players take turns playing Early Event cards and State cards.  The initiative winner chooses whether to go first or last.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.   First Combat Phase&amp;#10;-    The Initiative winner may play an Attack card (or use a Both card as an attack card).  The other player may play a Defence (or Both) card. If the Force of the Attack card is higher the defender takes damage equal to the difference.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5.   Last Combat Phase&amp;#10;-    The Initiative loser may play an Attack card (or use a Both card as an attack card). The other player may play a Defence (or Both) card. If the Force of the Attack card is higher the defender takes damage equal to the difference.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6.   Late Event Phase&amp;#10;-    Players take turns playing Late Event cards. The initiative winner chooses whether to go first or last.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7.   End Phase&amp;#10;-    Players may discard down to 2 cards.  The player with the higher Judgement score may discard down to 1 card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner is the player that kills his opponent&amp;rsquo;s Immortal.  To do this you must first reduce his Life points to zero. Next, you must do extra damage to him with a decapitation card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
