						               													<description>A card game for 2+ players based on The Pacific Rim Movie and representing Kaiju vs Jaeger Combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common 52 playing card deck. Each face card has a unique ability for each type of Jaeger or Kaiju which are described in each unit&amp;rsquo;s unique face card lists (there are six different Jaeger, and six different Kaiju). Number cards are used the same way by all units depending on their suit.  Hearts = Attack, Diamonds = Dodge, Clubs = Damage, Spades = Armour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player picks one Kaiju or Jaeger to control. There should be equal numbers of each if possible. Players may play 2 units, but must have a separate hand for each. Each unit (Kaiju and Jaeger) start with 20 Hits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 8 phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.    Draw Phase&amp;#10;-     Each player fills their card hand to their base hand size. Seven is the base hand size of all units but hand size can be decreased as a result of card play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.   Tactics Phase&amp;#10;-    The current player may discard up to 4 cards and draw replacements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3.   Attack Phase&amp;#10;-     The current player (the attacker) picks a target enemy unit to attack (the defender).  The attacker plays an Attack (Heart) card. The attacker may play 1 or more face cards to increase his attack score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.    Dodge Phase&amp;#10;-     The defender may play a Dodge (Diamond) card. The defender may play 1 or more face cards to increase his dodge score. If the dodge score is equal to or greater than the attack score, the attack misses in which case skip the Damage and Armour phases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5.   Damage Phase&amp;#10;-    If the attack hit (i.e. was not dodged), the attacker plays a Damage (Club) card. The attacker may play 1 or more face cards to increase his damage score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6.   Armour Phase&amp;#10;-    The defender may play an Armour (Spade) card. The defender may play 1 or more face cards to increase his armour score. If the armour score is equal to or greater than the damage score, the attack does no damage. If the damage score is higher, the defender takes hits equal to the difference. Units are destroyed when they are reduced to zero or less Hits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7.   Combo Counter Phase&amp;#10;-    The attacker may play a face card with the Combo ability to attack an additional time this turn. This attack may be against a different opposing unit. After this, the defender may play a face card with the counter trait to also make an attack this turn (against the current player).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;8.   End Phase&amp;#10;-    All players may discard up to 2 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues until all enemy units are destroyed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
