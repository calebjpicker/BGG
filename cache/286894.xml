						               													<description>Unpredictable up to the last hand, Electoral College Combat combines strategy and chance as two players amass Electoral College votes while navigating Fake News, Russian collusion, recounts, celebrity endorsements, and swing states to become President of the United States.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 56 cards:  50 state cards and Washington DC, whose value is reflected in their electoral vote count, and five wild cards.  28 cards are dealt to each player who take turns laying five cards face-down and sight unseen from the top of their stacks.  Each player turns over one card.  The player with the higher card can take that card and any other or the lower card and two of the remaining face-down cards.  Opponent gets the remaining cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Electoral College Combat is designed to simulate the wild swings and uncertainties of election night.  A sound strategy--like a well-run campaign--does not guarantee results.  That's all part of the fun.  While not a gambling game, Electoral College Combat finds its roots in video slots/poker where the wild cards activate bonus rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each wild card has specific rules.  A player who turns over a second wild card in the same hand wins the remaining cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are twelve hands.  In the 11th and 12th hands each player has only three cards remaining.  When their turn arrives, players must add two cards of the cards they've collected to their hand:  their highest card and another of their choice, shuffle the cards, and place them in front of their opponent.  Play continues as before. When play is concluded, the player with 270 or more electoral college votes wins the presidency.  2nd prize?  Hindsight and book deal.
