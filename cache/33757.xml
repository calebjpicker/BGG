						               													<description>From the publisher's website:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[GridIron Wars is] a full play-by-play simulation of football that plays rapidly. Once you are familiar with the game, you'll be able to easily complete a game in 40 minutes or less.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal in designing GridIron Wars was to create a game that played rapidly, was easy to learn, statistically accurate and most importantly, fun. I think that I&amp;rsquo;ve succeeded on all counts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The design of GridIron Wars is what I&amp;rsquo;ve come to term as Back to the Basics sports gaming. With the advent of the computer and the Internet, today&amp;rsquo;s game designer has a wealth of data at his fingertips. Today&amp;rsquo;s sports games are highly sophisticated and most are highly accurate as well. While a great many are outstanding designs, sometimes I feel like the &amp;quot;fun factor&amp;quot; has disappeared as the games have become more advanced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In GridIron Wars, every skill position player is rated to perform as they did in real life. You'll be able to compile full statistics for every offensive player. On defense, you'll be able to track individual player stats for interceptions and sacks for most seasons where the data is available.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Defense plays a huge part in GridIron Wars, you'll &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; teams with great run defenses stuff the opposition with regularity. You'll experience the effects of team's with a great pass defense, or a lock down secondary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ships with a complete solitaire system that will select offensive and defensive play calling, as well as individual ball carriers and receivers. Or if you choose, you can handle all of the play calling yourself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
