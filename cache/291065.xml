						               													<description>Departure on the Nile puts 2 to 4 players in the 1830s to 1880s in Egypt. During this period, Egypt under its rulers and the increased influence of Europeans experienced a tremendous upswing. The first railway lines were built, cotton was grown and exported, the Suez Canal was opened, as well as schools and hospitals built on the European model. Not least, the country also opened up for the emerging mass tourism, which brought a large number of people in the land of the pharaohs and pyramids. The players in Departure on the Nile embody young investors from Europe who want to contribute to the expansion of the country and invest in the Egyptian economy, solely with the aim of achieving the greatest fortune. Departure on the Nile is a classic worker placement game in which each player starts the game with only three of their own colonial officials. The construction of buildings, however, bring specialists into the country, who can recruit players using a novel mechanism (felucca travel and rail travel) and from now on can use. The game comes with a high level of interaction so it does not have the character of a multiplayer solitaire game. All players are involved at all times, whether through the use of the buildings (owners receive a bonus), by rail travel or the use of the Suez Canal where players can receive money and influence through their share certificates. Since the game is all about earning the most money at the end of the game, every investment in the game should be well considered. The game material is relatively extensive, the random game structure (bonus tiles, majority tiles, building tiles, personalities) guarantees a long game stimulus that prevents deadlocked strategies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
