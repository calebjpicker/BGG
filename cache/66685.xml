						               													<description>OP COM: Operational Map Combat in World War II.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A set of detailed rules for running an umpired, double-blind World War II wargame for two players or teams. Written orders are issued by the players and the results are resolved by the umpire. The players represent command staff at division level or higher. The units controlled by the players are at least battalion sized and each game turn is a half day. The map scale will vary by scenario.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the rulebook:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;These rules started out as a set of guidelines for the operational megagame Operation Market Garden. This game was run twice, once in 1988 and again in 1993. In the course of these outings, the rules altered and benefited from considerable feedback from participants. The game system I offer here is a distillation of that feedback from users, together with additional thoughts and research.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;It is intended as a generic map gaming system for WW2 operations in the Western Europe Theatre, that is, covering operations from Normandy to the Baltic. With some alteration they might be suitable for the campaigns in Italy, although the terrain and operational practices make that theatre sufficiently different to make a rethink of the rules a good idea. The rules are not suitable for the Eastern Front or the Far East. The underlying assumptions vary far too much.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Operation Market Garden was a large and complicated operational game. It involved forces down to battalion level and headquarters up to Corps. When running such a game there is a lot to bear in mind, and the game system has to be robust in order that things progress smoothly. Of course, these rules do not need to be used only in the context of a full sized 100 player megagame -&amp;#10;there are plenty of smaller operations that they could as easily be used for in the context of a club game for half a dozen players.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;In addition to the reasonably straightforward aspects of ground combat the rules consider the problems of air-ground operations (both close support and airborne operations) and logistics (hopefully not quite as boring as some folk make out!).&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
