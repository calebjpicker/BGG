						               													<description>At the beginning of time, there was the Island. It existed in balance with all things. One by one Mythical Beings arose from the depths, created from one of the four Elements of Fire, Air, Earth or Water. The Mythical Beings prospered, in harmony with the Elements and each other. After eons, the Elements themselves became restless and chaotic, breaking the fine balance of the Island as each Element tried to conquer the others. The Mythical Beings were forced into hiding and elemental chaos reigned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are one of the Protectors, your task is to establish the balance of nature so the Mythical beings can return and thrive in harmony. In the end, only the most successful Protector can become the ultimate Guardian of the Island.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sagnir is a tile laying game for 2 - 4 players, ages 14 and up. It can be played with younger players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the game, players will draw Mythical Being cards that show a certain arrangement of the five different Landscape tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players&amp;rsquo; aim is to arrange the Landscape tiles on the table to create the pattern shown on the Mythical Beings&amp;rsquo; card. Then players need to move their pawn onto a tile of this pattern to activate the Mythical Being card, scoring poi9nts that are counted at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when any player has activated a certain number of Mythical Beings, according to the number of players. The player with the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All Mythical Beings in the game are based on Icelandic &amp;amp; Nordic folklore. Descriptions and stories of each Being can be found in the separate Mythiopedia booklet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sagnir is replacing a previously published game from 2019, Mythical Island.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of The Nordic Heritage collection from Gamia games; Vedur, Runir &amp;amp; Sagnir.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
