						               													<description>Based upon the Japanese anime &amp;quot;Project A-Ko&amp;quot;, the game tries to re-create the endless battles between A-Ko and B-Ko for the friendship of C-Ko.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Project A-KO fighter is a card game based upon the mechanics found in the card game &amp;quot;Heavy Gear fighter&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Video fighter&amp;quot;. The games are even compatible with one another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This particular game is made of 36 different playing cards that were included in the &amp;quot;Project A-Ko: The Roleplaying game book&amp;quot;. Included in the roleplaying book were two different character sheets (one for B-KO and one for A-KO), that needed to be photocopied in order to keep track of the progress of players during the game. Their number of action points left, their remaining health, etc. as well as being used as a reference sheet for the various special powers each character had.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was meant as a stand-alone card-game that could also be played within the boundaries of the role-playing game as a player's aid for the game. Players were encouraged to describe verbally how exactly their characters attacked the other using a particular card. It provided those players that described the action behind a card play with special bonuses to their character's statistics, such as increased delivered damage to their opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also included in the book were various other characters that could be used against B-Ko and A-Ko, such as &amp;quot;ordinary persons&amp;quot;, tanks, mechas and spaceships, which could bring the game to more than 2 players (to an infinite number if needed), although no character-ready sheets was made available for them in the RPG book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
