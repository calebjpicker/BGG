						               													<description>The Necronomicon is undoubtedly the most emblematic book in the mythology of H.P. Lovecraft. In this game you will assume the role of Abdul Alhazred with the aim of completing all sections of the aberrant book. It is a game for 2 to 4 players with game modes for 20 or 60 minutes. Necronomicon is presented in a limited edition that continues The Writer, and comes with the amazing art of Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Launet (Goominet), with exclusive Cthulhu pawns for the sanity count (collector&amp;rsquo;s edition) and an impressive Necronomicon book case made by hand, in wood, in antique book format (Deluxe edition).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to play: The objective of the game is to complete the Necronomicon. Each player is dealt five cards at the beginning of the game. Each card represents part of a section of the book. Each section of the book is completed by collecting at least 5 cards from that specific section, identified by a symbol. The game is divided into several rounds, each of which ends when a player manages to complete a certain number of sections of the book (each round will be more complicated than the previous one). The complete sections of the book are marked with tokens until the Necronomicon is completed and the game is won.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a turn there are only two moves: draw card (to choose from the deck or the discard pile) and perform an action by placing a card on the table, which will serve to bring new cards into the hand or to get rid of others mainly. You'll have to decide whether to sacrifice an important card to take advantage of the card's action or to play more conservatively. The card that is played on the table is available for the next player, who in turn will decide whether to draw it or take a new one from the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a round is finished (managing to complete the sections of the book and discarding the remaining cards) the tokens are placed on the completed sections of the book and the players who have been left with cards in hand will lose sanity points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rounds follow each other until all the sections of the Necronomicon are completed and the game is won.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
