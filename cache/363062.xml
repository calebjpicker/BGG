						               													<description>Steam Battalions is a non-collectible, customized deck XCG, or Expandable Card Battle Game featuring stunning Steampunk &amp;amp; Dieselpunk art in which 2 players face-off against each other, each using a customized deck they create from their own Starter Deck at the beginning of the game. Each Starter Deck contains the same specific 68 cards, from which each player customizes their own deck down to 40 cards plus 3 &amp;quot;deck-diving&amp;quot; Armory Cards, as outlined in the Steam Battalions rulebook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE STORY:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In an alternate past, the great wars of the early 20th century are waging high above the clouds and across the mud-filled trenches of Europe. The armies of the World's Superpowers battle for supremacy with elite units forged in brass, iron and steel in a technological arms race powered by diesel and steam. You &amp;amp; your opponent create, customize &amp;amp; command your own elite Steam Battalions of Deck-Dueling Steampunk &amp;amp; Dieselpunk Dirigibles, Airships &amp;amp; Superheroes &amp;amp; send them into battle equipped with powerful Upgrades &amp;amp; Tech in the quest for Victory!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAMEPLAY:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Steam Battalions is a fast-paced, 1-vs-1 Customized-Deck Dueling Steampunk Card Battle Game for ages 12 &amp;amp; up that takes approximately 30-45 minutes to play. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get 7 victory points (defeating 7 of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s unit cards in battle), or if your opponent has no units to move out from their trench, whichever comes first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It features streamlined combat mechanics with a unique twist on &amp;quot;deck-diving&amp;quot; cards that deepens the strategy in ways unique from other card battle games. In Steam Battalions, you can only receive &amp;amp; play these special deck-diving &amp;quot;Armory&amp;quot; cards after you lose one of your units. This prevents either player from gaining an insurmountable lead during early gameplay &amp;amp; opens up new strategic choices you won't find in other card battle games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay &amp;amp; deck-building mechanics are specifically designed to reduce the 'grinding' of most deck-dueling games while increasing the speed of the combat, customization, upgrades &amp;amp; strategy - all in a richly illustrated Steampunk &amp;amp; Dieselpunk world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     NOTE : Each player requires their own deck to play, so the game is sold as a complete two-player set of two starter decks. For even further customization, experienced players can purchase additional starter decks &amp;amp; may add cards from as many additional starter decks as they wish, subject to the deck customization rules outlined in the Steam Battalions Rulebook (free for download at link below).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
