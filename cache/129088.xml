						               													<description>The Immigration game is an adaptation of John Conway's abstract zero-player game of Life to a two-player game.  It was first described in Lifeline, a newsletter dedicated to Conway's Life, in 1971.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Immigration game, players setup the game by taking turns and placing 5 pieces each of their color on a 25x25 rectangular grid.  Each position in the 25x25 grid can be either alive or dead, the living positions (or &amp;ldquo;cells&amp;rdquo;) are those that have a counter placed in them. Once setup is complete, the pieces are not moved and board positions evolve without player intervention according to the rules  of Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life, as listed below:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At each turn (or &amp;ldquo;generation&amp;rdquo;) the state of a cell is determined by the following rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.     If a live cell has less than two neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it dies in the next generation (&amp;ldquo;loneliness&amp;rdquo;)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.     If a live cell has at two or three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it stays alive in the next generation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3.     If a live cell has more than three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it dies in the next generation (&amp;ldquo;overcrowding&amp;rdquo;).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.     If a dead cell has exactly three neighbors in the eight neighboring cells, it becomes alive in the next generation (&amp;ldquo;reproduction&amp;rdquo;).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New living cells, which come into being by having exactly 3 neighbors, take on the color of the majority of those three neighbors.  Note that all cells in the 25 x 25 board have 8 neighbors each as the board is considered to wrap around the edges to each opposite side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the 10th generation, the player with the most living cells is allowed to place a counter thus adding an additional live cell of his or her color, followed by a turn by the other player.  If both players have the same amount of live cells, generations continue to develop until one player has a majority, at which time the generations stop so players can place their new live cells and the process begins again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues this way until one of the players has no live cells left and the winning player is the only one with live cells on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
