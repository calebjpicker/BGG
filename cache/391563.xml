						               													<description>Strategically collect friends to throw a successful party. Players aim to gather all their friends and score points while competing to be the first to reach 20 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game, the kigushun cards are shuffled and placed face down. Each player is dealt four cards, and the remaining cards are kept within reach. Players carefully examine their cards and consider which friends they want to bring together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During their turn, players add a card to their hand and place one card face up in play. The next player can either draw from the deck or take a card from the face-up cards. This process continues until someone is ready to &amp;quot;party.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player has five cards and believes all their friends have been gathered, they declare &amp;quot;Agari!&amp;quot; and reveal their cards. Each card is checked to see if all the friends have been collected. Successfully completing the party without any missing friends earns points. Each friend collected is worth one point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues until a player accumulates 20 points, at which point they become the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
