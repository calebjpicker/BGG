						               													<description>Victory at Sea: Royal Navy Submarines &amp;amp; MTB sections&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Submarines: Designed for use in North European and Mediterranean waters, the S-class was manoeuvrable with a noted ability to crash dive extremely quickly. Combined with a large salvo of torpedoes, this was a successful design of pre-war years that was soon updated and put back into production.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MTBs: The Fairmile A was designed from the outset to use prefabricated components that could be produced by small businesses such as furniture manufacturers, which would then be assembled at shipyards. Capable of 25 knots, it mounted a 3-pounder gun and a pair of .303 machine guns, as well as Depth Charge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed with the form of a destroyer&amp;rsquo;s hull, the Fairmile B (like its predecessor, the Fairmile A) was intended primarily as a submarine-chaser, and so was fitted with Depth Charge. Manufactured in large numbers, the Fairmile B was also famously used on the raid on St. Nazaire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Capable of 26 knots, the Fairmile C was a motor gun boat, mounting two 2-pounders and eight machine guns of various calibres. It was mainly used for close escort duties and some clandestine missions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nicknamed &amp;lsquo;Dog Boat,&amp;rsquo; the Fairmile D was highly adaptable and could be fitted with a range of armament that meant it could act as both motor gun and torpedo boat. Some were used by the Royal Air Force for long range rescue of downed airmen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;3 S-Class Submarines&amp;#10;4 Fairmile MTB Sections (A,B,C &amp;amp; D)&amp;#10;Ship Cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
