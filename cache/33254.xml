						               													<description>BSO FOOTBALL&amp;#10;THE HISTORY OF PRO FOOTBALL&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For fans of Tabletop Sports games, and Football, here is one of, if not THE, best solitaire play football card/board game ever. BSO FOOTBALL provides its players with remarkable statistical accuracy in almost every category, in the most accessible, playable form in the game industry. There&amp;rsquo;s no trying to outguess yourself on offense or defense. You just call the play and roll the dice (which you provide). Player Cards, one for every offensive player on the team, the Defensive Ratings on the Team Charts, and the Results Tables do the rest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Check the sample Player Cards, above, to see how players are rated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Team Charts provide the ratings/information for Defense, Interceptions, Clutch Play,  Fumbles, Penalties, and the full range of Returns and Kicking details. They also have Extra Information on Special and Unusual plays that team used. The Charts include Rushing, Pass Completion, Pass Gain and Return, Out-of-Bounds, Medium and Long Gains, Kickoff (including Onside Kicks), Punting (including Blocked Kicks), and a full range of Penalties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game Clock is also extremely accurate, with each quarter using 180 &amp;ldquo;points&amp;rdquo;, each point equal to 5 seconds. A normal play would use 8 points, but an incomplete pass or Time Out only 1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first edition of BSO FOOTBALL brings you one of the greatest seasons in the History of Football, 1958, with the famous overtime Championship game between the Colts and the Giants. In the East the Giants and the Cleveland Browns, led by the great Jim Brown, had to use a playoff game to determine the winner, and the Steelers, led by the veteran Bobby Layne, were not that far behind. In the West, the Colts beat out both the Bears and Rams by one game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some of Pro Football&amp;rsquo;s greats are present:  Ollie Matson, Norm Van Brocklin, Johnny Unitas, Jon Arnett, Y. A. Tittle, and the first glimpses of Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, and Paul Hornung, all playing for one of the worst Green Bay teams ever (1-10-1)! And wait&amp;rsquo;ll you see the average yards per pass catch!  Steeler rookie, Jimmy Orr, led the league with 27.6, with many others not far behind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For gamers who like to play entire seasons and revel in great statistical accuracy, BSO FOOTBALL is unbeatable. And, if you wish, there are special rules for face-to-face play, which use extended play calling (although, to be up front, that is not the game&amp;rsquo;s strong point).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;player cards:  150&amp;#10;team cards&amp;rdquo;  12&amp;#10;others:  Charts, Schedules, Rules&amp;#10;cost:  $14 US; $15 Canada; $17 Pacific&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
