						               													<description>This is a detective game about the adventures of Chicago Tribune staffer John Fitzpatrick, an investigative reporter, in the thick of the events taking place in Chicago in the early 1930s.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At a time when the Great Depression was breaking out in the United States and Prohibition was about to be repealed and Prohibition had been in force for over a decade, the influence of gangsters was especially strong and no event in Chicago seemed to happen without their interference.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the role of journalist John Fitzpatrick, you have to make sense of six intricate stories, each with its own independent plot, while also being partly related to the others, its own unique set of figures and clues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cops and gangsters, musclemen and bootleggers, civilians and the Chicago Tribune-all the people you meet along the way can provide valuable information or just deceive you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Detective experience, intuition and logic must guide you through a web of lies, innuendo and coincidence. Slipshod facts, suspicious events, cyphers and charades are the things that will help shed light on these mysteries and help unravel the most complex cases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;More than 100 unique locations await you during the game. Among them, for example, the Chicago Tribune, the Boeing Aircraft Company's test centre, Imperial Restaurant, the University of Chicago, and the small town of Dixon, just a couple of hours away from Chicago.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once Upon a Time in Chicago: 1930 is a development of Once Upon a Time in Chicago, but you don't have to go through the first game to play the new one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
