						               													<description>Launder is a solo money laundering game that requires the player to manage both the money they've laundered and the attention of the FBI, which is represented by Heat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player begins the game with a Boss Asset card (representing their illicit employer) and a small amount of Dirty Money, which they use to purchase Building or Person Asset cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Turn, a player advances the current Month, draws an Event card, and resolves the FBI track, which generally tends to hinder the player by adding additional Heat to their most high-profile Assets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Activation Phase, the player can activate their Assets. Most Assets allow the player to roll a variable number of Income Dice, though others allow the player to Refresh Activated Assets, move Heat between different Assets, or take more unique actions. Depending upon the result of the Income Dice, the Asset might generate Clean or Dirty Money, gain Heat, or some combination of the above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If an Asset gains 5+ Heat, it is discarded from play and advances the FBI Track by one space. The exception to this is the Boss Asset, which is not discarded from play (but still advances the FBI Track).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player can then use their money (Clean or Dirty) to purchase additional Assets, weighing carefully just how much money should be invested and how much should be saved away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the player has accumulated enough Clean Money at the end of a Turn, they meet their quote and win the game. If they have not met their quota at the end of 12 Turns, however, their boss rewards them for their failure with a pair of cement shoes and a long walk off a short pier.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
