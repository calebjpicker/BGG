						               													<description>Pick a Vowel is a 2-5 player (works best with 3) board game for families. Players move together around the board collecting letters and cards, aiming to create long and high scoring words. The first player to reach the word limit (decided at the beginning) ends the game, giving all other players one more turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are many different strategies that can be taken, such as; &amp;lsquo;lots of small words, a couple of long words, or go all out on completing objectives&amp;rsquo;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The great thing about Pick a Vowel is no one is left idle. Even if it isn &amp;rsquo;t you turn, you still move around the board collecting letters and cards. This makes it especially good for younger players as often children become bored waiting for their turn.&amp;#10;Another great aspect about the game, is the unpredictable winner. Since there are so many ways to get points, like using words which have lots of vowels, or completing heaps of objectives, by the end of the game, the winner could really be anyone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards are one of the most important part of the game, as they are used to interact with other play ers, like stealing their letters, or stopping another player make a word, but also are used for perks, like increasing the value of vowels or allowing you to make two words in a turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pick a Vowel has many different levels of complexity, offering a light,gentle game for children, or an intense, challenging game for adults. The use of objective cards, and letter penalties increases the difficulty dramatically. The length of the game can be adjusted by simply deciding the word limit at the beginning.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Very cool word game with lots of interaction, interesting twists, and very little waiting time. Makes you want to play again. Why didn't I invent this game?&amp;quot; - Professional Game Designer and Mentor - Martin Nedergaard Anderson&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;There are choices, you stay involved, there are different strategies that can work - but it rewards longer/more difficult words&amp;quot; - Manager of Board Games Australia&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Easy to play, good pace, enjoyable - Competitive and encourages bad blood between players&amp;quot; - Designer from Protospiel - Sydney 2014 &amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Fast pace, interactive, different levels of difficulty, great for all ages, can't predict the winner!&amp;quot; - 18 year old play tester.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
