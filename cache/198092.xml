						               													<description>This game is a solo or co-op game depending on if you have any friends who would like to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Movement is on a grid based system which is turn based. Each character has a number of Life Points which equal to abilities within the game as well.  When they are wounded their life goes down which also reduces their abilities within the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players complete their mission by surviving the game map (which is random apart from a few key elements that will always appear) and completing their mission objective by returning to their starting vehicle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It maybe to retrieve something, destroy something or any manner of events.  These events are decided by the roll before gameplay beings of the Dice of Destiny which give a primary, secondary and bonus mission.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment is varied and unique in some cases.  Players start with an amount of points that they can purchase equipment which they can carry and keep in the starting vehicle as this has capacity to store extra equipment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The characters available are classic type heroes who range from spies to thieves. The single player can control two of these while co-op each player can only control one each.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scene and era is pulp fiction / cult era and general classic caper / 70's film type scenario!!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The missions are random generated and can include such types as:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Stop a doomsday device.&amp;#10;     Save the husband of the bride.&amp;#10;     Kill the undead allied zombies.&amp;#10;     Replace the Six Million Pound's man bionic parts with lesser quality items.&amp;#10;     Save Schr&amp;ouml;dinger's cat.&amp;#10;     Rob the safe.&amp;#10;     Collect evidence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everything you need to play the game apart from the dice will be included within the Print and Play rules that are free.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game can be supplemented with additional furnishings and miniatures. The system allows for very easy expansion and 3rd party supplemental material.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game also offers basic characters&amp;rsquo; progression and surviving characters can be moved from one adventure to another.  This in essence means that you may benefit from equipment from a prior mission if you play wisely.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
