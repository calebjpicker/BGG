						               													<description>It's the future. People communicate using an interconnected computer network and industrial techno is the only remaining musical genre. Mankind has mastered technology and is finally about to cross the final frontier, leaving Earth and colonizing space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since the recent discovery of vast resource deposits below the Moon's surface, four of the most wealthy and prominent nations have taken aim at establishing lunar outposts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Lunar Outpost, the players take on the roles as the supreme and beloved leaders of the four nations. Lead your nation to glory and you will be forever remembered in the history books. Lead your nation to defeat and your entire nation will be forgotten as a parenthesis in history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to the space age.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Lunar Outpost, 2-4 players compete over a precious but limited resource. They do so through drawing and placing hexagonal terrain tiles depicting the barren surface of the moon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most tiles feature a location suitable for constructing a building and a few tiles feature resource deposits. Each tile may connect to some, none or all of its neighbors through its edges. Tiles only connect when the terrain of the shared edge is passable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts out with a single building next to a small resource deposit and is only allowed to expand their outpost to connected tiles that are unclaimed by other players. This must be done as the total number of resources that may be extracted from the resource deposit is limited.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throughout the game, new resource deposits will be discovered. In order to obtain the valuable resources, players must construct buildings capable of harvesting the resource in the direct proximity of the resource deposit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game features several different building types that may be constructed, each with their own perks and granting a certain number of victory points. Resources are consumed when buildings are constructed so players will have to form a strategy and adapt depending on how the game develops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Agressive players may construct buildings capable of recruiting troops and attack other players' buildings and/or troops. Defensive players may construct defensive structures to prevent agressive players from reaching their resource producing buildings. Terrain can also be used as an advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player may be heavily decimated from the attack of another player. It is even possible for players to coordinate their attacks against a stronger opponent and prevent them from dominating the game. Although rare, players can even be completely eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends in the turn where the last tile is placed. Players compute the total number of victory points awarded from each of their buildings left standing and the player with the most points wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
