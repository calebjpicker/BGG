						               													<description>Legendary Bahadurs (LB), a new expansion for its game Aristeia!, which will expand the options available to players and the versatility of the games with four new characters, each one with a new playstyle. Legendary Bahadurs is not a complete game, you need a Aristeia! Core Box to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This expansion sees the return of four of the greatest Bahadurs &amp;quot;Aristeia Champions&amp;quot; to the HexaDome. The famous commentator of Vissiorama and five-time Bahadur, Final Boss, has decided to return to the competition by gathering a team of old companions. Shona Carano, a remarkable swordswoman; Koorie Queen, the very first Bahadur; and Oberon, a support geist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shona Carano's game role.&amp;#10;Shona Carano is a specialist in short-range combat, where she is quite lethal. It&amp;rsquo;s a profile that stands out in scenarios where there are character clusters, or it&amp;rsquo;s important to conquer and defend a Scoring Zone.&amp;#10;Some of her tactics have the ability to execute free actions.&amp;#10;Her Attributes are average, and her Defense is low, so she has to act quickly and take great care of Enemy Shooters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Koorie Queen's game role.&amp;#10;She is a harasser specializing in the hunting and incapacitation of support characters, or characters with a low Hit Points value.&amp;#10;She makes use of the Hidden State only while performing Offensive Actions.&amp;#10;Her Bounce Ability is perfect to finish off injured Enemies. In addition, it imposes the IStunned State.&amp;#10;Koorie Queen&amp;rsquo;s Defense and her Agility, in combination with her Switch, make her very elusive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Final Boss' game role.&amp;#10;This is a complete profile if there ever was one. Final Boss is an off-tank with stamina by virtue of his good Defense and his Automatic Ability i-Khol, with the ability to deal damage over a short range with his Attack.&amp;#10;He has great Brawn and Agility values which give him the ability to activate his Switch and impose the IStunned State within short Range.&amp;#10;You can impose the States Dazzled and -2U, which gives him a bit of control ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Oberon's game role.&amp;#10;Oberon is a support character that works with our Tactics deck, and imposes a new State in the game: Silenced. Taking into account the Mulligan at the start of the game, and the cards &amp;ldquo;I have a Plan&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Catch your Breath&amp;rdquo;, it won&amp;rsquo;t be difficult to get the desired Tactics with Oberon on hand.&amp;#10;At the cost of discarding a Tactic, it offers the opportunity to add Yellow dice to any Roll of an Ally. This variant of Focused is extremely useful for anyone who uses &amp;quot;!&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;As is standard with support characters, his Defense is weak and his Hit Points value make him a very fragile target.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The expansion introduces the Silenced State.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
