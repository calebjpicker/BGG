						               													<description>Your loved ones soul has been taken by the ever envious Death himself, and you've made the brave decision to delve into the depths of the underworld to bring them back! The gameplay can almost be described as the love child of games like Mini Rogue and Escape the Dark Castle. The underworld is dark and full of danger. You'll be illuminating the paths in front of you, pushing you luck, managing your resources, and determining your odds before venturing further.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You'll also encounter many foul ghosts, ghouls, and creatures of the dark along the way. Combat involves its own unique system of rolling die simultaneously against your enemies, and using your arsenal to swiftly defeat your opponent while reaching your desired battle outcome. Each level of the underworld is protected by a Deaths fiercest minions. You'll have to get past them to continue advancing further into the unknown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is full of immersive flavor text that help paint a story of your unique adventure. The artwork is meant to be dark and gritty, but also playful and approachable. It's sprinkled with bits of humor to remind you that although the theme is dark, its still fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
