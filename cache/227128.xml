						               													<description>Each player controls one North American Indian Tribe.  Players use their people to gather food and to raid each other and the white men.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Different types of tokens are used to undertake actions and record progress:&amp;#10;-  Population Tokens (PT) are used to conduct actions such as raiding and hunting. Each Population Token represents about 50 People. &amp;#10;-  Land Tokens (LT) are used to give access to food and resources. &amp;#10;-  Food Tokens (FT) are used to feed your people.  They are gained by claiming certain cards. &amp;#10;-  Horse Tokens (HT) give advantages to Raids.  &amp;#10;-  Weapons Tokens(WT) give advantages to Raids. &amp;#10;-  Spirit Tokens (ST) have a variety of uses. &amp;#10;-  Trade Tokens (TT) represent things like furs and skins or crafted items that are used to trade with whites for things like weapons and horses. &amp;#10;-  Craft Tokens (CT) represent an accumulation of skilled labour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common Spirit Card deck.  Cards are of 2 basic types: Resource Cards and Bonus Cards. &amp;#10;-  Resource cards provide tokens and are then Discarded. &amp;#10;-  Bonus Cards are placed face-up in front of the owner and provide either a continuous benefit or are discarded for a one-time benefit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game each player gets 10 PT, 10 LT and 10 ST. A player mater is utilised to track the status of the tribe and indicate how the PT are being utilised throughout the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is conducted over six turns with each turn comprising 9 phases as follows: &amp;#10;1. Season Phase&amp;#10;-  Place 7 x no. of players cards from the top of the spirit deck face up. &amp;#10;2. Braves Phase&amp;#10;-  Players take turns activating Population Tokens one at a time.  An activated PT can hunt (claim a face up spirit card) or go on a raid or go trading. &amp;#10;3. Hunt Phase&amp;#10;-  Resolve Spirit Card purchases and conversions as soon as they are claimed.  Some Spirit Cards have a purchase cost in tokens. This must be paid immediately.  If the purchase cost cannot be paid, the card cannot be claimed.  If the Spirit Card is a resource card, immediately gain the indicated type of tokens and then discard the card. &amp;#10;4. Territory Phase&amp;#10;-  If you have more LT than PT, gain FT equal to the difference. &amp;#10;-  If you have less LT than PT, lose FT equal to the difference.&amp;#10;5. Food Phase&amp;#10;-  Each player discards FT equal to their PT. &amp;#10;-  If they are short then roll once on a Starvation Table for each FT they are short and resolve results. &amp;#10;6. Raid Phase&amp;#10;-  Players take turns conducting Raids. &amp;#10;-  Each PT held in reserve conducts its own raid. &amp;#10;-  When making a Raid, declare the target of the Raid: &amp;#10;Target Opponent, Non-player Tribe, or White Men. &amp;#10;-  Roll for results on the appropriate raid table and resolve accordingly.&amp;#10;7. Trade Phase&amp;#10;-  Players may trade Tokens with each other or with white men (using set conversion rates) &amp;#10;8. Encroachment Phase&amp;#10;-  Each player rolls once on an Encroachment Table and resolves results accordingly.&amp;#10;9. Spirit Phase&amp;#10;-  All unclaimed face-up Spirit Cards are discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played over six turns. At the end of the 6th turn scoring is conducted as follows:&amp;#10;Player with most LT gets 10 VP&amp;#10;Player with most PT gets 9 VP&amp;#10;Player with most HT gets 8 VP&amp;#10;Player with most WT gets 7 VP&amp;#10;Player with most ST gets 6 VP&amp;#10;Player with most CT gets 5 VP&amp;#10;Player with most TT gets 3 VP&amp;#10;Player with most FT gets 2 VP&amp;#10;Player with the most Bonus Cards get 4 VP&amp;#10;If tied in a category, all tied players get the points -1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If at any point during the game a player loses all his Population Tokens or Land Tokens he automatically loses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
