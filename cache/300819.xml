						               													<description>Kaiserfahrt nach Palastina (&amp;quot;Imperial Journey to Palestine&amp;quot;) is a typical spin and move mechanism based board game about traveling, but unique for historical theme (travel to Holy Land) and valuable components.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before, during and after the second journey of the German Emperor Wilhelm II (ruled 1888-1918) in the Ottoman Empire in 1898 a wide variety of media and entertainment articles were produced and brought onto the market in order to publicize the trip, to benefit from it in any way or at least to make it understandable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1846-1931 testifies: &amp;raquo;Our emperor's journey to the Orient, as the most significant event of the past year, was still lively for the minds. All serious patriots could not think of this great and, in some ways, dangerous undertaking by the beloved ruling couple and their happy ending without a deep movement. All kinds of details of the trip, such as the importance of the whole company at home and abroad, kept the heads busy.&amp;#10;It is therefore not surprising that the publisher and &amp;raquo;Royal Court Printing Company Adolph H. Engel, founded in 1848, took the opportunity to on the occasion of the imperial journey and the company's 50th anniversary, a board game under the name &amp;raquo;Imperial Journey to Palestine. &amp;#10;The publisher was thus in line with the times. The first travel board games were created around 1800 in England and the USA. As so-called running games with obstacles, the course of which was determined by dice, they were based on the classic board game, the type of didactic goose game that has been known for centuries and has existed in countless variations, which was thematically mostly historically or geographically oriented. Now, on a mostly foldable, but still stable game pad, views of cities, landscapes, monuments and other sights were graphically depicted more or less elaborately along an itinerary and designed into a course on which the players replay a corresponding trip with all its amenities and dangers and after could experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
