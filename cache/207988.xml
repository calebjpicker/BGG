						               													<description>Small, sparkling treasures are lying on the ground floor: colourful pearls hiding in shells. In Perlen Tauchen you play as pearl divers searching for these precious objects from the depth. You are salvaging and cracking the shells &amp;ndash; but other divers are also on the scent of you and those pearls. To cap it all off you are struggling with the rough sea during your quest. The nacreous pearls reach their full value only when they join as chains, corresponding with your mission.&amp;#10;Your goal is to be the first to build the highly coveted pearl chains. The winner will be the pearl diver achieving that goal most frequent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The shell cards lay down with their back side, like they were laying on the sea floor. There are mission cards for 2, 3 or 4 players, showing the required shell colors for each of the ten rounds. Each player has two action cards on his hand. In every turn a player draws a third card and plays one of them. He may either turn one card of his own or on the sea floor, or take it to his own shell chain in front of him or do both, take and turn it. There are also action cards to steal from another player or swap with another players card. In the case of a &amp;quot;flush away&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;seaquake&amp;quot; the player must play this card immediately. In the first case he has to lay one of his cards back on the sea floor, in the second case all cards from the sea floor will be drawn to their back sides and shuffled again. &amp;#10;A round ends when a player has fulfilled his mission for the current round. Afterwards all cards wil be shuffled again for the next round. All players now should achieve the goal of the following round. The players may play up to 10 rounds. Who wins the most rounds is winner of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
