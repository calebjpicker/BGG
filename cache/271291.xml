						               													<description>Tijou is game coming form Quebec (Canada).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is played with &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     1 game board with 36 course boxes and 4 finish squares&amp;#10;     4 families of 3 rooms&amp;#10;     1 set of 54 cards (including joker)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to send his 3 pieces in ARRIVAL.&amp;#10;to do this, the 3 pieces must enter the course and exit (CASE ARRIVAL).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Tijou is played by team&amp;#10;Each player faces his teammate and places his pieces in front of him (Off-board)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Player: A dealt cards at the rate of 5 cards per Player counterclockwise (3 + 2).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The teammates exchange 1 card, each will choose the card he gives before looking at the card he receives (It will be the same after each distribution).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Player located to the right of the one who distributed starts = Player: B.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;He then places 1 card in the center of the board and is obliged to execute the value of the card placed in one of his pieces.&amp;#10;Each cards has a value (go forwards/backwards of X boxes, enter in game, go to the arrival, exchanes of pieces,...)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If he can not execute the value of the card placed on one of his coins, he plays a card without playing a coin.&amp;#10;This is the opponent on his right to play = Player: C.&amp;#10;Then it's the turn of: D (then A, B, C ... so on.)&amp;#10;When a player has only 2 cards in his hand, he has the option to keep them, he then abstains from playing by specifying that he passes his turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The other players have the same choice and can continue to play until their cards are exhausted or pass their turn when they want.&amp;#10;(A Player can therefore keep 1 to 2 cards at the end of each turn)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tijou ends when a player has sent his 3 pieces in ARRIVAL.&amp;#10;The team of this player is declared winner.&amp;#10;At the end of each game, it is awarded 1 POINT to each team-mate of the winning team.&amp;#10;Then: Change of team for a second part.&amp;#10;Then: Change of team for a third part.&amp;#10;The Player (s) with the most points at the end of 3 games is (are) declared winner (s).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
