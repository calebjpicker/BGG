						               													<description>Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once again, unsuspecting vacationers begin disappearing in the waters off the small resort of Amity, and also further up the sun-drenched coast. Only a few people know the truth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes on the role of a desperate mayor, managing a small seaside town in the midst of a blood-soaked crisis, fending off an unknown number of Great White sharks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jaws: Deep Red Sea is a fast-playing, non-authorised, non-profit, and non-collectable card game based on the films: Jaws, Jaws II, Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge. For 2-6 players, this game is a shark-filled, blood pumping experience, where all players draw from the same central deck. Each player manages their hand of cards - to defend their beaches with Fend off with High-pitched Screams, Brody's Service Revolver, Improvised Explosives, Rifle and Gas Cannister Ploy, Crushed Beer Cans, Kick feet desperately, while shrieking, The Orca, and Undersea Power Cable Trick, etc, as well as play scarily large Great White Sharks against their opponent's swimwear-clad vacationers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player may also recruit grizzled experts from around the world to safeguard their beaches from closure. Such shark hunters include Quint, Matt Hooper, Philip FitzRoyce, Hoagie Newcombe, and Chief Brody.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The mayors can also utilise, to save themselves from monstrous fish, some of the following example cards: &amp;quot;Sh-sh-sh-shaaaRRRRKKKKK!&amp;quot; and Eat Screaming Woman - Brandishing a Flare gun while soaked in petrol and Moonlit feed, and the strutting Adonis, Shelby Overman, and Eat Powerboat Water-skier, and &amp;quot;That's some bad hat, Harry,&amp;quot; and Eat Diving School and &amp;quot;Overman was killed inside the park. The baby was caught inside the park. Its mother is inside the park,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Love to prove that, wouldn't ya? Get your name into the National Geographic,&amp;quot; and Consume Rescue Helicopter and Pilot, and &amp;quot;You tell Shelby Overman for me he can take a flyin' leap in a rollin' doughnut on a gravel driveway, you hear?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Don't be silly. That would indicate a shark of some 35 feet in length,&amp;quot; and Bite off leg, and &amp;quot;Lens my ass!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Karateing the Picket Fences,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I don't believe it! Two barrels, and he's going down again!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Bad fish. Not like going down the pond chasin' bluegills and tommycods. This shark, swallow you whole,&amp;quot; and The Indianapolis Yarn, and &amp;quot;This was no boat accident!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat,&amp;quot; and lastly &amp;quot;What d'ya have there - a portable shower or a monkey cage?&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Money is spent in the game buying Shark Hunters and equipment. Players can also, at any time, spend cash to alter Shark Attack dice rolls, setting the situations up whereby opponents' bathers may be devoured by monstrous Great Whites. Also, some cards, like &amp;quot;Beach Closed,&amp;quot; cost the target mayor cash, from revenues lost, forcing them to buy less Anti-shark gear. Money is generally in short supply. Steal or swindle it from other mayors if you can.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with 10 vacationers and $10,000.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Last mayor with his beach still full of bathers wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;NOTE: There is no player elimination. When a mayor has run out of holidaymakers, all his cards and poker chips are removed, and then he can only play Shark Attack cards on the players remaining - attacking the mayor with the most vacationers left in play (he's got the most bathers in the sea). If there is a tie, the player playing the Shark Attack card decides who to devour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
