						               													<description>Welcome to Until the Bitter End - US Airborne, a World War 2 wargame. This is the second game in the series and a print and play game for solitaire and two-players. This is a standalone game in my series of WW2 print and play games. You don't need to have played the first game - everything is included (you simply need to print it all out and need a regular six sided dice and a pencil).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a game and requires very little space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A print and play WW2 wargame for two players and solitaire that takes around half an hour to setup and play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game sets a small squad of US Airborne against their German enemies in a series of small skirmish scenarios. The game's counters (or chits) each represent an actual soldier with the gameplay being in the thick of man-to-man combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be played 2-player with one player playing as the US Airborne and the other player playing as the Germans. The game can also be played Solitaire with the player playing as the US Airborne against the German AI. For gamers familiar with Solitaire wargames this game uses a random chit-pull mechanic (as detailed in the video).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in a number of Turns. In each Turn the player(s) randomly picks a Pull Chit from the mug and activate their Infantry. The Game Turn ends when all the Pull Chits have been removed from the cup.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player whose Pull Chit this force belongs to can now Activate one Infantry Counter. In activating the Infantry Counter the player can choose from several Actions such as Firing against the enemy, moving, charging into close combat, applying first aid, or attempting to fix a jammed weapon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is simple and effective without needing buckets of dice. Players must establish range, line of sight and any modifiers. &amp;#10;Close combat is particularly brutal and decisive with the playing be able to declare charges into combat.&amp;#10;Snap Fire is a defensive fire mechanic where your Infantry Counters can fire on moving enemy counters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, the game features a unique mechanic in the shape of Bravery Points. These can be used to force the enemy to re-roll a dice against one of your Infantry Counters, but should you loose you will have less Bravery Points for the rest of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Game&amp;#10;The Solitaire takes the key gameplay from the two player game such as Combat Resolution and Movement etc and layers in specific Solitaire rules, AI for the opposing German forces and special Solitaire scenarios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Solitaire game features a full and simple AI to handle the opposing force, that will take you step-by-step to which order the enemy counters should be activated and their actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
