						               													<description>From the designer, Matt Arnold:&amp;#10;Antigrams is a 5-minute 2-player print-and-play abstract strategy game, involving simultaneous tile placement, subtitled &amp;quot;Rock Paper Scissors Tiles&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment is a stack of 48 identical square tiles, each divided diagonally into a light-color triangle and a dark-color triangle, presumed in these instructions to be white and black.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Choose which player is which color from the two colors on your tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, both players drop a tile. After the first turn, they alternate having first choice of where to place. Tiles must touch any edge of at least one tile that is already played, or of a location the opponent has currently chosen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hiding the front side from the opponent to conceal the tile's rotation, they position their tiles upright with its edge on the table. Simultaneously, when their tiles are both touching the table, they tip their tiles toward each other so the tiles are laying down on the table. Repeat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players attempt to form three target shapes with their own color and the opponent's color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Look for a Black rock which crushes a White scissors, for instance. The game would immediately end in a victory for Black-- unless a White paper is formed at the exact same time, and covers the Black rock. That's one point for White and one point for Black. In that case, the game continues until one player has at least one more winning shape combination on the board than the other. If the score is still tied when the last tiles are played, the game is a draw.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is possible for two tiles to be part of multiple shapes. For example, a White scissors and White paper can share two tiles and still qualify as two complete shapes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Strategy Basics:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Pay attention to what structures your opponent is building, and disrupt them if necessary.&amp;#10;     Remember, with every tile, you are placing your own color and your opponent's color.&amp;#10;     &amp;quot;Telegraph punches that you're not throwing.&amp;quot; Get your opponent to believe you're building toward a particular victory, and suddenly switch to build a different one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
