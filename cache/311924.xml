						               													<description>It&amp;rsquo;s the year 3327 and the human race has expanded deep into the solar system. However, supporting civilization on such a large scale uses lots of resources which are in scarce supply!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Powerful, Hyperdriven Rockets piloted by adventurous privateers, such as yourself, compete for the desperately needed and lucrative resources found on the billions of Asteroids in the vast Oort Belt surrounding us.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gather as much as of each type of Resource you can before the others beat you to them, as you strategically navigate your Rocket through wormholes in deep space. But be careful, this is a highly competitive and cut-throat enterprise. If you&amp;rsquo;re not careful you could get raided by your competitors and lose it all!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Quick and easy to learn, light and fun strategy game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In clockwise turn order, each player places their Rocket in the center Wormhole of any unoccupied Game Board Tile. They then immediately take all adjacent Resources (orthogonally or diagonally) to their position. Once all Players have set their inital positions and taken their resources, they now must move their Rockets using either their Impulse Engine or Hyperdrive once per turn, then take Resources and/or raid other Player&amp;rsquo;s Rockets if possible from that final position.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when the last Resource has been taken from the Game Board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your Rocket is fast, but has no steering or brakes! Thus, you can only move in one direction (orthogonally or diagonally) and must continue in that direction until you are blocked by an Asteroid, another Rocket or the edge of the Game Board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also, wormholes are littered throughout the Oort Cloud. You may choose to pass over or jump through them to another open Wormhole, but must continue your movement (in the same direction) until you are blocked.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Instead of using your Impulse Engine, you may engage your Hyperdrive to jump and stop at any unoccupied space, including Wormholes. However, you may not take any adjacent Resources or raid other Rockets upon arrival at the new location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to taking Resources from Asteroids, you may also Raid a single Resource from any Rocket(s) your movement ends adjacent to as long as you were not already adjacent to the Rocket(s) you are raiding at the start of your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is over when the last Resource is taken from the Game Board. The amount of points you receive is based on how many of each type of Resource you have collected. Thus having all five of a Resource yields 10 points, but having only one scores 0 points. In addition, you also receive a 5 point bonus for each completed set of six your Resources make up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a hand crafted game, made to order with high quality, durable acryllic components.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
