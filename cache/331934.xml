						               													<description>Ages: The History Of Mankind is tells the story of humanities struggles throughout the ages. Starting from the Stone Ages, players will be able to guide humanity's evolution from small tribes to thriving cities that shine as a beacon to the world. Compete with other nations for resources, technology, and conquests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ages: The History Of Mankind is a 1-4 player game where players build the world as they search for resources to feed their people, fund their technological growth, and prepare for war.&amp;#10;Each game players start with completely different goals for their tribes to accomplish and should be kept secret from the other players. Players then use their starting resources to plan out their year and grow their tribe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ages: The History of Mankind is a civilization builder that uses historically accurate modeling of the resources, technologies, and peoples so players can relive the excitement, mystery, and struggles humanity has faced. Stone Age is the first of many expansions that see humanity start as small tribes struggling to survive and grow into Iron Age dynasties!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will use their meeple scouts to find new lands (hex tiles), gather resources from the lands they occupy, and establish new colonies out in the expanding world. Colonies can grow in power through technology and send out more scouts into the wild to claim even more land and grow into a dynasty! Colonies can also produce warriors to conquer foes in distant lands. The explored land plays an integral role in travel of your meeples, resources available to grow your colony, and provides different resources depending on the season.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As players progress through the years, they will need to plan their harvests, manage the consumption of resources by their citizens, and dedicate resources for learning new technology. Each season brings new possibilities and new ways for you to conquer your opponents!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
