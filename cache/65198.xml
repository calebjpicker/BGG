The game recreates the slaughter what 2000 potiguares indians attacks the &amp;quot;Tracunhaem&amp;acute;s Engenho&amp;quot; (Tracunhaem&amp;acute;s Sugarmill) and kill all Portuguese colonists and slaves. The main objective for Portuguese player is resist for 8 turns against the indians. The objective for indian player is kill all colonists and slaves.  The game is for novice wargamers, easy rules and short time of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the period of colonization of Brazil, in the year 1534, there was an incident known as Trag&amp;eacute;dia de Tracunha&amp;eacute;m, in which Indians killed all the residents of a mill called Tracunha&amp;eacute;m in Pernambuco. The justification for this attack was due to the kidnapping, followed by the disappearance of the chief Iniguassu&amp;rsquo;s daughter, after marrying a Mamluk adventurer. It was a requirement that both of them, after the wedding, remains in the Indian village, but this did not happen. Iniguassu&amp;rsquo;s first step was to send two of his sons to Olinda, in Pernambuco, to claim justice. Fortunately, they met on a visit to Pernambuco, the governor of Brazil, Ant&amp;ocirc;nio Salema, who ordered the beautiful Indian to return to her father&amp;rsquo;s house immediately. On the way back, they had to spend the night at Engenho Tracunha&amp;eacute;m, by Diogo Dias. When dawn dawned, India disappeared, possibly hidden by Diogo Dias. His brothers complained a lot but did nothing and returned home without his sister.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taking advantage of this, the French stationed in Para&amp;iacute;ba instigated the Potiguares to revenge, and soon a contingent two thousand Indians of diverse Potiguares tribes marched against the mill. The Indians surrounded the fortified mill and used an unusual tactic: only a few Indians let themselves be seen to make it believe that it was the action of a small group. When the plantation&amp;rsquo;s defenders went out to counterattack, they were attacked by a crowd of Indians. The mill was burned, and it appears that only two family members survived because they were not at the mill. After this episode, other Itamarac&amp;aacute; mills were also attacked, resulting in 614 deaths. This episode generalized the fear in the Portuguese settlers of the region.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It caused the king of Portugal to extinguish the captaincy of Itamarac&amp;aacute; and create the captaincy of Para&amp;iacute;ba, with limits from the mouth of the Popoca river to the Bay of Trai&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o. In this way, it would protect the sugar industry, expelling the French, and expand the domain to the north of the Northeast region.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Bellum Brasilis series was originally produced by the extinct Riachuelo Games and was directed to games at the tactical level, covering several episodes in the history of Brazil. This wargame is the first in the Voxelhouse Old School Wargames series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
