						               													<description>Desert Generals is a medium-complexity operational level game of the Desert Campaign, from 1940 to 1942.The game  captures the ebb and flow of the North African Campaign from late 1940 to November 1942 with a unique emphasis on leadership and command. The game also recreates critical supply constraints. A player refighting the Desert Campaign, like his real-life counterparts, cannot fight continuously &amp;ndash; he launches an offensive, pauses to build up supply, then resumes his offensive&amp;hellip;unless his opponent has preempted him and launched his own offensive first. As in real life, offensives tend to run out of gas (literally) as they approach the enemy&amp;rsquo;s home base.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Historical elements include air support, minefields, engineers, artillery, anti-tank guns, Axis fuel shortages, and Allied command and control problems. From Operation Compass to Second Alamein, Desert Generals covers the Desert War from start to finish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
