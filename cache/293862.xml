						               													<description>&amp;quot;There was a time, around year 2000, where several bad sci-fi movies predicted that the Earth would become an uninhabitable wasteland, fact known as &amp;ldquo;we jumped into the lake&amp;rdquo;. They also predicted humanity would conquer space, seeking for a better place to leave because, well, what else could we do. Who would have said that the better fortune tellers were in cheap sci-fi movies? Maybe it was just a matter of luck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When we started to surf among the stars, we were too lazy to collect any garbage. Therefore, the space is now full of that trash. Those were the days; we could afford throwing all kind of things though the spaceship wc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now resources are limited. That trash, that we threw away so carelessly, is now the most valuable currency in the space. More than gold, more than any other mineral, now plenty in any rock in the space. No one studies how to make a screw, that&amp;rsquo;s why they cost so much.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Let&amp;rsquo;s stop talking. Welcome aboard. You probably know something about us, the Those Little Assignments Co. We travel through the space, jumping into the hyperspace, avoiding threats looking for resources and, who knows, maybe a mighty artifact.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please go to the sign board. Every day there is a new adventure to live. Well, we really have no &amp;ldquo;days&amp;rdquo; in the space, but we still count every 24 hours, just not to get crazy. I hope you enjoy your time here.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Little Space Errands is a game for 1 player, with games of around 20 minutes length. You will face a variety of threats represented by cards, using different resources of your ship and using the dice to get some loot. Current art of the game is provisional and for demonstration purposes only.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
