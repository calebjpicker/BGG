						               													<description>The goal of the Magical Forest board game is for players to populate the forest with special creatures. However, this is not as simple a task as it seems. Mushrooms only feel good in a community, while magic trees like to live with a couple. The unicorn can be a propitiator for witches and fairies. And the dwarf likes to rest under the mushrooms, in the shade of the trees.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, everyone gets their own forest board, then we put together the pine tree elements - everyone has to put them in the same places! No more tiles can be placed on fields with such a pine tree. Then, each player must put 5 tiles of each character (dwarf, magic tree, mushroom, unicorn, fairy, witch) into the canvas bag and shake the bag well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game will last for 5 rounds and players will place 6 tiles on their board in each round - 2 tiles are placed face down first, then flipped over when everyone is done. After that, everyone passes the other cards to the left. This will continue until the bag is empty.&amp;#10;Note: It is advisable to place the received tiles in such a way that they will be worth as many points as possible. The rulebook describes in detail which magic creature has what extra&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scoring sheet for the game also helps with scoring at the end of the game. Whoever has the most points will win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be played in several ways: in addition to the basic game, there are target cards at different levels of difficulty, which can also be added to the game as difficulty. Among the target cards, the easy and the hard ones can always be obtained by the person who succeeds in completing the task first, and the medium-level card is dealt at the end of the game to the player who has the most magical creatures of the type requested by the target card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A thoughtful, somewhat strategic board game with nice graphics, in which cards are passed using a drafting technique.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
