						               													<description>This game is a kind of Pachisi played on a flexible domino board which changes its layout tho whole game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a players turn one rolls a die and moves one of his initially 6 figures as many fields as was rolled. The start position are two special domino stones with the players color. Each domino stone consists of exactly 3 landing points which are moved on at the players turn. If the figure of a player stops at the middle point of a stone this stone can be rearranged to a different position.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a opponent figure can be captured it has to be done in which case this figure is removed from the board and can not enter again. The same happens if the number of required steps cannot be performed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who has at least one surviving figure wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
