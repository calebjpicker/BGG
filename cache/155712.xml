						               													<description>The board represents a spider's web. The spider's den is in the center. 19 pieces are used: one spider, 13 common(yellow) flies and five blue(green) flies. Blue flies count three and common flies are one for a total of 28 points. One team is the flies the other team is the spider. Object of game is to score 15 points. Flies attempt to get into spider's den and score according to their values. Spider seeks to consume flies and keep them out of his den.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Moves are somewhat like checkers. Spider jumps the flies and removes them from the board. Flies do not jump. Common flies may only move forward or around the circle. Blue flies may move backwards as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flies start first. The spider may move in a straight line on any of the lines running toward the center as far as he please. He cannot pass over the double circle either going out or coming in without stopping there one move. On all the circles except the double one the spider cannot move any further than the flies can (one space). On the double circle the spider may move 1/4 of the way around at one move. The spider may jump in any direction as many times as his moves entitle him to. He is requited to stop at the next crossing beyond each fly jumped. If several flies are in position with but one crossing between each fly he must jump all such flies (no matter what direction it takes him) stopping at the next crossing beyond the last fly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The spider may jump from his den and take any fly on the double circle unless there is another fly in front of or behind it. It also enables him when on the double circle to take a fly standing on the crossing 1/4 the way around if there is no fly on the next crossing beyond and none between. The spider may move clear across the double circle passing through the center on his way and jump a fly on the opposite side of the double circle if there are no intervening flies and none beyond the fly to back him up. The spider may move from the double circle to the outside circle in one move (nothing intervening) but cannot return to the center when outside the double circle without stopping one move on the way at the double circle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
