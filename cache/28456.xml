						               													<description>From the intro:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Rattenkrieg&amp;quot; is designed as a stand alone game system that allows players to recreate fighting in built up areas during the Second World War. However, because it is based on the popular, tried and tested 'Kampfgruppe' series it is also compatible with the rest of Dropwing's World War Two titles, allowing scenarios of infinite variety to be created.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Urban fighting is held by many to be one of the most challenging aspects of modern warfare and this is equally reflected by the challenge of representing such combat on the war games table. This volume enables various types of infantry and vehicles to test their mettle against some of the unique situations to be encountered whilst fighting in built up areas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some of the most significant battles of the Second World War were fought in urban surroundings, such as Berlin, the Warsaw Uprising and perhaps most notably Stalingrad. However, it should also be remembered that, in addition to such epic and historically significant encounters, countless smaller actions took place within the towns and villages along the paths of advance made at all stages of the war. The prime purpose of &amp;quot;Rattenkrieg&amp;quot; is to enable this style of combat, along with its unique atmosphere and challenges, to be recreated on the tabletop.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special procedures are presented to incorporate sniper duels, sewer fighters and tank hunting teams, in addition to more mainstream combatants. Ready reference sheets are printed on facing pages and due to the comb binding the book can be opened flat to speed up play by having all of the main procedures available at a glance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Rattenkrieg&amp;quot; also includes a scenario based on an historical event, which can be used to introduce new players to the game as well as form a basis for experiment with various aspects of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
