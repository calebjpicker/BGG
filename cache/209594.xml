						               													<description>Inis Vare - Welcome, Earth-dweller.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is the year 3251 Earth-Standard-Time. Mankind overcame its century old conflicts a few decades ago, and now strives for the stars as a unified species.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Millennia past the humans eyes looked up to the stars uncountable times, yet they didn't know that there were always others who looked back to them, from stars far away. While the rise to glory for mankind has just begun, the old species will continue to ignore them, while they split up the galaxy among themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While fierce battles raged in the depth of space, trade and smuggling prospered, spies tried to gather secret knowledge and sinister laboratories sought always for new ways to annihilate rivals or solve the riddle to gain immortality. ... in all that Chaos of the crimson night... you Earthlings might be able, to save and preserve a part of the Universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inis Vare, Mortal, in Intervention!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Intervention is a 4X turn-based strategy game set in space. There are four phases to run through per player and turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In phase one the player rolls the die and moves. Depending on where the token ends up, it can have unexpected impact on the player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In phase two resources are gained form planets, colonies, conquered worlds, alliances, technologies and strategic resource-fields, that are occupied by his ships.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In phase three the player can take various actions. For example, building ships, move, conquer, colonize, research, trade or sign alliances.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In phase four you check if you have fulfilled one of the three victory conditions and tell it the person to your left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends, if one player has fulfilled one of the victory conditions at the end of a turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You may have to trade, cooperate, advance through research, or conquer your opponents to win this game. You also share the stars with non-playable factions, neutral star bases, and many other planets, asteroids and greater Neutrons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What does make Intervention so special and worth to be played?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The designer has created an own unique universum for the game, the so called &amp;ldquo;Interversum&amp;rdquo;, with its own unique history. The Interversum is populated by 14 different species already, but it is planned to extend this pool further in the future. A player can even create its own unique species by using our civilization builder, which then can find its own place in the Interversum.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Furthermore, there is a lot of additional gaming material of high quality included. Every civilization comes with 30 spaceship tokens, each with six individual drawn spaceships. The species cards (faction cards), where the players income and victory points are marked, are coated with an iron lamination, that lets the magnets adhere on them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At last there is to mention, that the board is made out of modular square cards, of which are more in the box than needed for a single match. That means every match is unique and not repeatable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
