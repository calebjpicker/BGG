						               													<description>Published in Basin City, WA with assistance by the Every Other Tuesday Night Gamers &amp;amp; War Eagles Gaming Society. Can be used with 15mm appropriate figures, players will need to provide at least 1 6-sided DIE for each player, a 6-Ft. Tape measure, a Protractor for determining Gunfire &amp;amp; Observation, Artillery Facing changes, Gatling Gun Firing Arcs, and Cannon &amp;amp; Howitzer firing arcs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is suggested that players provide Figures for their characters in the following positions: on Horseback; on Foot; Kneeling; Prone. I would also suggest Figures displaying various armaments such as Pistol wielding, Rifle Armed, Knife or Sabre displayed, etc. The Rules CAN also be used for 25mm Figures and there are annotations in ( ) for this scale. There are Character Record, Artillery Record, and Horse Record Sheets which will have to be copied in order to provide enough for everyone. It is suggested that each Player control no more than 6 Characters per playing. There is a Pregenerated Character List to help gets things started quickly, but most folks will want to create their &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; Old West figure they have in mind. Players will find a Regional Map of the Plains section of the U.S.A. with various Native Areas located upon it and State's borders with numerous Forts &amp;amp; Towns of the &amp;quot;Old West&amp;quot;. There is even a &amp;quot;Detail&amp;quot; map of an imaginary &amp;quot;Old West&amp;quot; area for assistance in starting up a Campaign for whatever the player's desire. The Back Pages of the Rules Booklet contain Movement Charts, Movement Modifiers, Skill Challenge Damage Chart, Observation Modifiers, General Skill Challenge Modifiers, Missile Combat Chart, Melee Combat Chart, Campaign Observation Modifiers, and Weapon &amp;amp; Range Chart.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Sequence of Play is as follows: 1.Initiative; 2.Movement; 3.Observation; 4.Missile Combat; 5.Melee Combat; 6.Artillery Fire; 7.Static Actions. NOT all of these will be followed since not everyone will be using some such as Artillery everytime. During Static Actions, players will do anything NOT covered in previous phases, such as Draw Weapons, Reload, Gamble at the Saloon, etc. There are even provisions allowed for conducting a Campaign while it is suggested that a Referee be employed for obvious reasons. The Designer has included some of the more well known names of Western characters as well as the better recognized encounters. Another section provides a Bibliography for Western Novel Authors, Western Themed Movies, and Western Non-Fiction books. So Circle the Wagons and Keep them Doggies Rollin'...yee-HAAAAA...*ker-RAACK*...Rawhide!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
