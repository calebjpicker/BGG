						               													<description>Free game published in the July 2018 (GTM #221) issue of Game Trade Magazine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Lord of the Fries Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Background: The Zombies at Friedey&amp;rsquo;s Restaurant have a funny way of making lunch. They throw all the ingredients into a bowl, and when a sandwich forms, they grab it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You Need: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: This game can be played cutthroat (with everyone playing alone), but with more than three players we prefer playing in teams. See Team Play with Odd Numbers below to learn how to do this with five or seven players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Structure: Lunch Rush is played in several rounds. In each round, players take turns playing cards into the center and trying to complete &amp;ldquo;sandwiches.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A sandwich is a sequence of cards in which one or more smaller cards lie between two matching larger cards. For example, 9-8-3-9 is a &amp;ldquo;nine sandwich,&amp;rdquo; made from two 9&amp;rsquo;s surrounding an 8 and 3. However, 9-8-10-9 is not a nine sandwich, because the 10 is larger than the 9&amp;rsquo;s. Playing a 10 into the second sequence would create a ten sandwich: 9-8-10-9-10.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: Two matching cards in a row does not make a sandwich, because there must be at least one smaller card between them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To Begin the Round: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player. The number of cards in hand, and the total number of rounds to play, is as follows:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players:   2 3 4 5 6 7&amp;#10;Cards: 10 9 8 7 7 7&amp;#10;Rounds: 6 6 4 5 6 7&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sequence of Play: Starting on the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left, each player in turn plays one card from their hand into the sequence in the middle of the table. If you complete a sandwich, you pick up those cards and score them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring: For the &amp;ldquo;bread,&amp;rdquo; the large cards that bracket the sandwich, you score one point per card. For the &amp;ldquo;meat,&amp;rdquo; the smaller cards inside the bread, you score face value. For example, a sandwich of 7-4-7 would be&amp;#10;worth a total of 6 points: 4 for the meat, and 1+1 for the bread. Keep these cards aside, with the bread face down and the meat face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues until all players&amp;rsquo; hands are empty. Record your scores for the round and pass the deal to the left.&amp;#10;The total number of rounds in the game is given above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Team Play with Odd Numbers?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With five or seven players, you can use a format of rotating teams. The dealer plays alone, and the other players divide into two teams. With five players, the teams are A-B-A-B-D, where D is the dealer. With seven, they are A-B-A-B-A-B-D. In a full game, each player deals once.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because these teams are temporary, each player keeps a separate score. Both of the players on a team score all of that team&amp;rsquo;s points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
