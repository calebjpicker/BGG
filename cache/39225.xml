						               													<description>Lookee is the &amp;quot;Search-A-Word Game&amp;quot;, for 2 or more players, that can be played by those of all ages. The game consists of a plastic tile board and 100 various tiles each with a letter and point assigned to it on each side. The game has five different variations of play. In Game One: The grid begins empty except for the word LOOKEE spelled out in the center. Using at least one letter on the board each player must take turns making their own word (with the 7 tiles they began with) using at least one pre-existing tile.Each turn must be finished within 30 seconds. These words could be spelled forward, backward, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player scores points for all the letters on their new word. After each turn, the player who went replenishes back to seven tiles. The player with the most points after the grid is filled is the winner. Game Two: First player to reach 100 points wins. In this game, the entire tile board is filled with letters at random. The first player tries to locate a word in any direction, and receives the added points for that word. The tiles used are then flipped over creating a new board every turn. The next player goes and so on. Only 30 seconds per turn. Game Three: Same as game two except additional option. Look for letter groupings that can be rearranged to form words. E.G. T,C,R,U,K can be TRUCK. First to 100 points wins. Game Four: Play solitaire by setting up the board as in Game One. Score as many points as possible in a given time period. Game Five: By using another game board, a duplicates version could be played by using identical letters and setting a time limit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
