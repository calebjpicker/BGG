Each player takes turns to ask a question such as, &amp;quot;Am I female?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Am I alive?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Did I invent something?&amp;quot;, ect. Each player takes turns to ask a question. If the player guesses their identity using 5 question or less, they get 3 points. If they guess using between 6 and 10 questions, they get 2 points. Between 11 and 15 questions gets 1 point and if the player does not guess who they are within 15 questions, they score no points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WINNING THE GAME: The first player to reach 15 points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
