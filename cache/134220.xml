						               													<description>King of 20 is a new competitive board game that is simple yet challenging. It can be played by anyone who understands basic math operations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In King of 20 players use number and operation tiles to form expressions which are placed on the game board. The goal of the game is to receive the lowest score possible by making expressions that are as close to the number 20 as possible. A player's score is determined by comparing the solution of their expression to the number 20. For example: an expression with a solution of 18 would have a score of 2. Players must use tiles already on the board and those in their hand to form or add to expressions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Although King of 20 is an effective educational tool, players of all ages and skill-sets can enjoy it. Young children and adults alike will love the games competitiveness, simple gameplay and sleek design.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ishmael King created King of 20 in March of 2011 when he was a freshman in high school. He noticed that subjects such as English and History were regularly adapted into board game forms, while the subject of Math was poorly represented in the industry. The few math board games that existed were too simple or too complicated to play, or were made for an age range that was too specific. So he took the opportunity to make a game himself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
