						               													<description>The Tale of Ibyron&amp;#10;There, it stood amongst the flames of their enemies: their homes, their lives, their city. &amp;#10;The only thing that the people of Ibyron could do was leave the village to burn under its new management. And so they did...&amp;#10;A voyage of what boats they could find that were not burned up by the intruders was the current plan, a plan that would bring the citizens of the once famed Ibyron City, back to a civilized society. But this time - this time, they would prepare for war as well. They would not be outmanuevered as they just were. Preparation of war must be on the agenda to save their new home from the unknown and known enemies. &amp;#10;First things first. They had to get to work building up their new land to the glory it once stood for. Every citizen would have a job, and each would build on the skills of others to create a citizenship only heard of through a Bard's lyrical stylings on the side of a road, begging for some alms to make ends' meet.&amp;#10;This would be the fate of the new Ibyron.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Theme aside, this is a card game. The goal of the game is to construct all tier-3 building cards ( or trash them [solo game], removing them from the game). Each turn workers are able to be used as a resource,  depending which workcamp is organized (played sideways). Cards spent as workers can be drawn into the hand to be used as a workcamp or constructed as a building with abilities to help with constructing other buildings. &amp;#10;As cards are discarded they go to the top of the deck if they are used as a worker.  Cards discarded as a workcamp are discarded to a discard pile. The game takes around an hour or less.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
