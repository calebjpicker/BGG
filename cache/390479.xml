						               													<description>DoomRoll was made for every Gamer that wants to have a ton of fun with their miniatures. DoomRoll is for every Gamer that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have 5 people around to play but, can always find one.  For every Gamer that thinks Warhammer is unbalanced.  It was made for every Gamer that wants to play, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the entire day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DoomRoll was made to improve roll play.  To make it simple.  To make it fast.  To make it fun. Combat is based on percentage (an ode to RuneQuest.)  Damage is based on 10 sideds.    Armor is subtracted from the total (Hero System.)  Each unit class has unique traits allowing game play and strategy to become unlimited (Death Test &amp;amp; Archon.)  Every game becomes unique.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DoomRoll is balanced and creative.  Allowing an infinite selection of landscapes to be created on the Battlemat.  With conditions to Victory that go beyond a war of attrition.  You can play Capture the Flag in DoomRoll.  You can play DoomRoll on a timer.  You can play DoomRoll with teams.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
