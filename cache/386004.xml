						               													<description>Kingdom Come is a battle-strategy game where players will pick one of four decks (referred to as kingdoms) to defend themselves against their opponent. Each kingdom contains seven character and nine weapons. Any character within your kingdom can use any of the weapons within that kingdom, but there will be one weapon that will grant each character a special ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can place three characters on the board at a time. The game is over when you have either defeated all seven of your opponents' characters or managed to defeat all of your opponents' characters on the board in a single turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We have incorporated nostalgic elements such as dominoes, card suits, and candy-land like characters into our game to give players a bit of nostalgia as they our brought into our world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
