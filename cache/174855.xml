						               													<description>THE PRINT AND PLAY VERSION CAN BE FOUND UNDER FILES&amp;#10;We would be grateful of any and all feedback&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The local bbq is coming up.&amp;#10;Go and win at life by taking a picture that shows off your awesome life. &amp;#10;Or, at least, try to look better than your friends do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Look at my awesome life is a short card game designed to have few rules but a lot of complex and meaningful decisions. &amp;#10;It is a challenging game, yet easy to learn and short to play. &amp;#10;Less experienced boardgamers are eased into a more complex game made less intimidating by it's inviting artstyle, short playing time and increasingly difficult playmodes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basics are simple. Players collect neighbors that are coming to the BBQ and place them in a line to form the most awesome picture. &amp;#10;Every round players choose a neighbor, the player that chooses the quickest goes first and:  &amp;#10;-places his neighbor in a picture.&amp;#10;-uses that neighbors ability.&amp;#10;-selects a new neighbor to take into their hand.&amp;#10;When any player has 10 or more neighbors in his picture the game ends. The player who has the most awesome looking picture (points) wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The different cards are what makes this game interesting. Some neighbors look better than others, meaning they are worth more look-at-my-awesome-life (lamal) points. Other neighbors are faster or have better abilities. For instance, some let you take neighbors from another players hand or let you switch around neighbors who are waiting to have their picture taken. &amp;#10;This is useful as many neighbors only look good in the right spot.  That hillbilly standing next to the BBQ with a jerrycan could make for an awesome picture, but not when a policeman or concerned mother is standing next to him...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Other playmodes introduce the option for fast neighbors to pick up stuff(cards), which can help your strategy in different ways and 'you'(cards), which reward you for having neighbors of a certain color. With these you get a game where there is no right play, only a right play for the situation!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
