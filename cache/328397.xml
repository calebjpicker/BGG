						               													<description>The Tu'x Rebellion and is based on an entirely new IP.  It is a cooperative/competitive Medieval Fantasy Strategy Game of my creation.&amp;#10;In the base game two to four players take on the roles of Noble Houses fighting for the King, gaining favor by winning battles and proving themselves worthy administrators in the midst of a Civil War. Players work together to overcome the rebels while competing with your allies to earn the most favor from the throne.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Key Features:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Factions:  Pick from one of four houses to play as during the campaign (House Kel, Lotan, Shobal, or the 7th Corps). Each Noble House has their own individual and unique strategy.&amp;#10;     Base Building:  increase your power and prestige by constructing military, defensive and economical buildings that can gain access to greater resources and higher quality troop types as they are upgraded.&amp;#10;     Resources:  As you expand influence and improve your land, you gain access to more resources. These need to be properly handled in order to bolster your power, help you grow and gain favor with the King.&amp;#10;     Army Recruiting:  Create your own army from core loyalist warriors and elite house troops.  Customize your army according to your vision. Train units to meet battlefield demands. Cooperate by sharing units through alliances to defeat the rebels and unite the loyalist factions.&amp;#10;     Political intrigue:  Internal and External events can quickly change the fortune for you and your fellow loyalists.  Manipulate these events to further your own goals while hindering those of your rivals.&amp;#10;     Battles:  Wage war against the rebels in skirmishes as small as five units or up to a massive battle of forty units.  Gather your allies to form large armies to bring the battle to the doorstep of the rebels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Tu'x Rebellion is a card-based strategy game similar to other customizable trading card games with battle tactics similar to tabletop miniature games. Players take turns simultaneously.  Each round is divided into phases; draw, build, conflict and discard.  Simultaneous play means the game is exciting for everyone and no one is left waiting to take action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battles are resolved in the conflict phase. One round of battle is split into the: Set up, Draw, Infantry, Ranged, Cavalry, Movement and Discard phases.  Action continues for allied players and the player controlling the Rebel Army during the battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You win by reaching a certain threshold of favor with the King.  However, everyone loses if the loyalists are defeated twice in battle or any player loses all the troops under their command.  Players must constantly balance the competitive and cooperative aspects of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
