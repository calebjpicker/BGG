						               													<description>Choose your warrior! Get your weapons ready! And enter the Holmgang, the deadliest place in the North, where the most powerful warriors fighting each other for life and death. Without fear! Without limits! Are you prepared?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Holmgang is a bluffing combat card game set in Norse history. Players playing as warriors in Norse arena called Holmgang to claim their rights and glory. During the game, players play hidden cards on the board, once all actions are done players reveal cards one by one and execute their actions simultaneously. Move, Attack, Defend or do any of your special character ability to outplay your opponent. But be aware, you are slowly running out of options so be careful in your planning to always have some backup plan.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each character is equipped with a unique set of weapons and 13 cards. Cards allow players to move with their weapons around the board or do some sneaky moves to try to find an undefended spot where they can hit the enemy with their attack. Attacking is the only way how players can deal damage to an opponent's character and defeat it. Each round players put 4 hidden cards on the board that creates their action decks. Once both action decks are complete, players execute all card from their decks one by one. The games end when one of the player's characters health is reduced to 0.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
