						               													<description>The game is played on an ordinary checkerboard. Each of the two players has 12 double-colored pieces or men(one black and white, the other green and red). The players place their men on the black squares of the 3 rows closest to them, so that the dark side (black or green) comes up.&amp;#10;Players take turns advancing their men on the black quares, only one square at a time. You are forced to jump over an opponent's man as soon as your own man touches that of your opponent and there is a free space behind him. Here, the opponent's man that has jumped over is taken along and placed at the bottom on the free space behind it. The jump must be continued if there is another opportunity. With each jump, only one enemy man can be taken as a prisoner. The man captured last is always at the bottom of the board. This is how towers are built. A tower moves or jumps like an ordinary man. If a tower is jumped over, only the top man may be taken and captured. If a man reaches one of the last 4 squares of the checkerboard, it is turned over so that the light side (white or red) comes up. He becomes a king. If a tower arrives on one of the last squares, only its top piece may be turned over. Such a tower moves or jumps like a king. A king may move forward or backward one or more squares or capture.&amp;#10;The game is decided when all of a player's men or kings are captured or when they can no longer be moved. The number of kings of both players gives the number of points with which the game was won.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
