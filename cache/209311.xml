						               													<description>This undated baseball game from Fairchild seems have evolved from the company's 1946 Baseball game. This game consists of two separate decks of cards: one of 28 Pitching cards and the other of 30 Hitting/Fielding cards. Also included are a small glossy baseball diamond and scoring box, erasable crayons for marking the score and wooden discs for baserunners.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To play, the Pitching cards are shuffled and placed face down between the players. The Hitting/Fielding cards are shuffled, and each player is dealt a hand of five. The batting player must discard and replace any Pickoff card, while the fielding player must discard and replace any Error card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For each turn, the fielding player turns over the top Pitching card, which shows either a Ball, a green Fastball, blue Curve, yellow Changeup or a red Slider. The Batting player draws a card from Hitting/Fielding deck and then must try to play a card that matches the color of the pitch. Each of these cards has a number from 1 to 4. The fielding player then draws a card from the Hitting/Fielding deck and tries to match the color of the hitting card. A color match with a number equal to or higher than the batting card is an out; if the fielding card is lower, the difference is the number of bases hit/advanced. A card that doesn't match in color counts as a zero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The batting player may use an Error card to automatically advance the batter and all runners by one base. The fielding player may use a Pick Off card to remove a runner on base. A fielding card 2 higher than the batting card is a double play if a runner is on first; 3 higher allows a double play of any two runners.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
