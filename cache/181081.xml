						               													<description>Welcome to the pretentious game of Hipsters. A world of social intrigue, popularity and betrayal. In a game of &amp;quot;Hipster&amp;quot;, you will fight over the current trendy location and its hipsters. By spending items or purchasing items, you can pretend to be something, that you are not. The hipster who persuade the most followers, win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Are you ready to become a pretentious board gamer?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup: Each player draws a random Hipster card from the Hipster cards deck. Add it facedown in front of the player. Add the &amp;ldquo;In the City&amp;quot; starting location card to the middle of the table. Each player draws 5 single value Item cards from the Item cards deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle the Item cards deck and split them into X piles face up (X is the number of players). Shuffle the Hipster deck and split them into X piles face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the lowest Hipster initiative, chooses the starting player. Players take their turn clockwise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Round: Starting with the first player, the player can play five Item cards from their hand. Each card has a printed status value, which can be used to purchase other Item cards. Item cards also have bonuses, when paired with other items. The more you combine, the bigger the pay off.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player can also &amp;ldquo;make a move&amp;rdquo; on a new hipster, from the Hipster deck, at the current location (not another players hipster). They do this, by spending items equal to or higher then the Hipsters printed status value. They place these item cards facedown at the location, and in that players turn, other players can fight for attention, buy spending items which subtract from the cards added by the initiating Hipster. When another player choose to spend items, the cards are discarded afterward and they will have that amount of card less in their turn, as they have played their card out of turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Hipster card, has different status values with each an attached event. The player can choose to &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; one of these statuses and activate the attached event. When buying a hipster, it becomes part of that players following. Each hipster card also has a printed association (i.e. Cafe Hipster). The players gathers hipsters, which match their starting hipster association, as they are the only one giving credit when ending the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player has spotted, that another player is collecting a specific association/trait, they can challenge that player by naming the trait. If they are correct, the player can once per game, select that players current hand. If they are incorrect, they must give the other player their hand. When a Hipster is bought, the player can choose to change location, as each location has events or abilities that might make things better or worse for the other players as the location will alter items and hipster values, traits and abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending the game: The game ends, when there are no more hipsters in the hipster deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning Condition: The Hipster with the most like-minded hipsters win the game (cards of the same trait).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
