						               													<description>Missing Persons is a turn-based game that includes 18 cards and five 'missing people' in the form of player pieces. Your goal is to be find the missing persons during your round, or the rescue mission, and save one of per round. There are a total of five rounds, each round you have the opportunity to save one missing person.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shuffle the 18 cards to form a face-down draw deck. Remove the top card of the deck from the game without looking at it. Each player draws one card from the deck. This is the player&amp;rsquo;s hand, and is kept secret from the others. On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. Then choose one of the two cards in your hand and discard it face up in front of you. You must apply any effect on the card you discarded. All discarded cards will remain in front of the player who discarded them, keeping them visible to all playing. Since this is a game of deduction and reasoning, this will help players try to count which cards are remaining. After applying the card&amp;rsquo;s effect, the turn passes to the next player, this game is played clockwise. A round ends when the deck is empty at the end of the final turn, the player with the highest rank hand saves the hostage. If there is a tie, the player who discarded the highest total of cards is the winner, even if that player was previously eliminated. The winner of the round oversees the next investigation and will shuffle the cards and begin another round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Missing Persons is a Search and Rescue game that is similar in play style to other deceptive based games. Your goal is to rescue as many of the hostages in play as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
