						               													<description>To scamboozle is to persuade your friends to support your opinion or point of view, no matter how outrageous or ridiculous it may be.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the is to win the support of at least a majority of the other players in any way you can by Scamboozling them with an opinion you think they will believe. You win or lose votes depending on whether you are successful or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players roll one or two dice to advance their marker on the board and must take different actions depending on the type of square on which they land. If they land on an Issue square, they have a full turn to form an opinion before having to convince their friends to support their view. If they land on a Scandal square, they must talk their way out of that scandal immediately. After a discussion, players vote on the Issue or Scandal. There are five possible outcomes: unanimous support, unanimous oppose, majority support, majority oppose and split decision. The player dealing with the Issue or Scandal must roll three colored dice. He will score or lose points on one or all dice according to the outcome of the vote.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win the game, players move around the outer portion of the board, known as the House, to gain votes in Green, Red and Blue categories. When a minimum number of votes for each is won (8 Green, 6 Red and 2 Blue), a player may advance into the Inner Circle, known as the Ministry. Once a player is in the Ministry, they continue to accumulate votes until they have enough to become a Candidate (16 Green, 12 Red and 4 Blue) but the games becomes more difficult. When there are two Candidates, only one can win. The winner is the player who can Scamboozle a majority of other players to vote for them as the new Prime Minister.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the box:&amp;#10;What is Scamboozling?&amp;#10;It is an opportunity for you to be as outrageous or ridiculous in your opinions as you dare. A chance to promise or say anything that will convince your friends to vote to support your opinion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the game that Canadians have been waiting for. You have experienced politicians doing it to you. Now here's your chance to Scamboozle your friends to elect you as the new Prime Minister!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
