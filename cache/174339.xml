						               													<description>A solitary game about commanding a US Army field hospital during the Vietnam War. The game features a resources management aspect in the building of the base and its staff as an effective task force, plus a detailed handling of casualties according to their medial triage level, having to be treated in different medical modules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game prototype is currently playable as print-and-play or using a Vassal Game Engine Module (see Files section). The Vassal Module supports an Observer player for a tutorial session or online shared play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, the player will recruit new personnel for the base, also improving its installations. The game engine will challenge the player with events and the need to fulfill missions to score points. The scarcity of resources will test your judgement as the base commander, having to prioritize, push-your-luck and even to make hard sacrifices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the rulebook:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nha Trang, Vietnam. November 1967. Orders come from Long Binh HQ.&amp;#10;You are assigned to 498th Medical Company, 55th Medical Group, 44th Medical Brigade, as Battalion Surgeon with the rank of Captain (O-3). Your duty is to set up and manage a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), to be deployed as part of the Counteroffensive Phase III Campaign.&amp;#10;In order to do so, you will be recruiting Personnel (specialist operatives and general personnel), and commissioning new buildings and vehicles (installations). With those assets, you will face threats to your facilities (events) and be called upon to participate in military operations (missions).&amp;#10;Sometimes you will be ordered to take wounded people into treatment in your Base. Wounded people will also flow your way as a result of enemy opposition during missions, and sometimes in the case of security, health or supplies threats to your Base. Having a poorly managed Base, forfeiting missions, and suffering casualties will reduce your promotion merits. Stay sharp, or your men will suffer and you&amp;rsquo;ll never make it to Major (O-4).&amp;#10;Taking part on the campaign operations (your combat readiness), along with an overall good security, healthiness and supplies situation in your Base will grant you promotion merits (victory points).&amp;#10;Godspeed, Captain!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
