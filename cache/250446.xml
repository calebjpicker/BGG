						               													<description>This WWII title uses a regular pack of cards in combination with the board. The board has a central pot (&amp;quot;Army Rummy&amp;quot;, surrounded by 8 other circles. Seven of these circles represent &amp;quot;money cards&amp;quot;, while the eighth is called the Poker Pool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin a hand, each player puts a chip in each of the nine circles; the dealer antes two chips in each. The dealer then passes out the full deck to the players, adding an extra dummy hand. If the dealer's hand contains no &amp;quot;money cards&amp;quot;, he may exchange it for the dummy; otherwise, he may auction the dummy, with the winner paying the dealer and replacing his own hand with the dummy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player to the left of the dealer starts by placing his lowest card in any suit in front of him. Whoever holds the next highest card in that suit then plays, and so on until the Ace of that suit is played. A player who is able to play a money card in its normal sequence collects that pot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whoever plays the ace in a suit then leads his lowest card of a suit of an opposite color. Whenever players reach a gap caused by one of the missing cards in the dummy hand, whoever played last leads his lowest card in an opposite-colored suit. The first player to get rid of all his cards then collects the money in the central pot plus, from each other player, one chip for each remaining card held.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The hands end with each player putting together a poker hand from his cards, with the highest poker hand winning the Poker pot. All chips still on the board remain there as players ante for the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The back of the game board provides a second game called Lucky Roll. It is played with 3D6, and players bet on either a total result from 3-18, or on a single number coming up at least once, twice or on all three dice. Whichever player acts as banker pays off the winners and keeps the remaining bets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
