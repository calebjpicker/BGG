						               													<description>Overview&amp;#10;In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Taghaza salt mines were a major part of the trade routes through Western and Northern Africa. In Taghaza: The Salt Mines players will try to mine salt and transport it via camel to locations around Africa in order to fulfill contracts and acquire gold!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the game&amp;#10;The game will take place over rounds with each player getting one turn per round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will be using their Worker Cards to mine the stacks of Salt Cards giving them the salt they need to complete the Contract Cards which will give the player gold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn, players will take an action by playing one card from their hand and then they will draw a card to end their turn. If a player chooses, they are able to play as many of the same type of cards from their hand as they wish in order to take that action the same number of times as the amount of cards played.&amp;#10;Below are a list of all the action cards and the actions they allow:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards&amp;#10;Worker Cards allow the player to take the top &amp;ldquo;Salt Card&amp;rdquo; from any mine but requires the player to remove 1 &amp;ldquo;Food&amp;rdquo; from their tableau when used (no matter the number of workers used.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Camel Cards have multiple actions and can be:&amp;#10;rotated and played to the tableau as a &amp;ldquo;Food&amp;rdquo; to feed workers in a later round.&amp;#10;discarded to build a house by placing a Housing Card from your hand to your tableau&amp;#10;used to fulfill Contract Cards by discarding the Camel Card as well as the amount of salt listed on the Contract Card. Camels can deliver up to 2 Salt Cards to a Contract Card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(If a player chooses the Camel Cards as their action, they can only do one of the camel&amp;rsquo;s actions but they can do it as many times as the number of camels they use.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Housing Cards let players increase the number of workers they are able to use each turn. Alternatively, each Housing Card can be discarded to draw two cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Discard/Redraw&amp;#10;If, at the start of their turn, a player doesn&amp;rsquo;t like any of the cards in their hand, instead of taking an action, they can discard any number of cards from their hand and then draw the same number of cards from the draw pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of a Player&amp;rsquo;s Turn&amp;#10;At the end of their turn, the player draws one card and play passes to the next player in clockwise order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending the game&amp;#10;As soon as the last contract is fulfilled or if, at the end of a round of play, there are only 5 of the nine mines left, the game is over and the player with the most gold is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
