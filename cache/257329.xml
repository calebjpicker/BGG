						               													<description>Dojo Sensei is a worker placement game set in the future on a fictional Japanese island called Meiyoshima. In this game, you are a sensei opening a new dojo, trying to make a name for yourself and your school.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dojo Sensei, you will make decisions that will customize your dojo, your fighters, and your students. You will carve a path to victory and honor by training students, turning fighters into warriors, putting on demonstrations of your skill, constructing and remodeling your dojo how you see fit, investing in different martial arts styles, competing in various martial arts competitions, and of course proving yourself in the Kumite!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are in control of 3 different types of workers - Sensei, Trainers, and Champions that will be placed on the main board and in their dojo.  The Sensei is a trainer that you can customize with bonuses or even break the rules.  The trainers are the majority of your workers and they will build your dojo and train your champions.  Champions are workers that are placed in competitions - forms, breaking, and weapons - that when resolved, will earn you victory points.  You can add more trainers and more champions to your dojo, but you will first have to start training them as students in your dojo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tableau&amp;#10;     Champions - players are able to customize up to three champions.  Their basic stats - Strength, Finesse, and Mastery.  As well as use trainers, to give their champions new maneuvers.  These maneuvers are the deck-bulding / card management of the game.&amp;#10;     Dojo - your Dojo is a player board that you will customize by placing different shaped tiles on it, that will slowly bring your dojo to life.  These tiles will give you actions and bonuses in the game.  Here you can decide if you want to focus on income, on building strong champions, on performances, on specific competitions, and many more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every play of Dojo Sensei will be different.  The goals you are reaching for to end the game will change, the tiles available to build your dojo will be different every turn.  The maneuvers that are available in the temples to train your champions will be different. In order to win you will need to both focus on how you will bring honor to your dojo, but also be flexible enough to react to your opponents and the conditions on the main board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
