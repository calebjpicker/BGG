						               													<description>The Pirelli Rallye Monte Carlo game represents a rally race with the board representing a Leg that consists of four road sections and three special stages.  The object is to be the fastest over three legs or three runs over the entire track.  In the 1980's the sport was a bit different.  Road sections were over public streets and going too fast or too slow garnered a time penalty. The Special stages were over closed public roads, private roads or trails in rural areas and speed was not restricted. In the game, the Road sections have a set number of dice throws in which a player is to travel the section with his car.  You may roll one or two D6 that have numbers 1,2 or 3 on the faces. Finishing in less rolls garners a 10 second penalty and finishing in too many rolls gets a 5 second penalty. For each special stage, a card is drawn with details of that stage and players must try and choose the best tyres for that stage, with weather conditions being a contributing factor.  Then an Unexpected Weather condition card is drawn.  The tire choice combined with info from the two cards modify the die rolls during the Special stage. The player then chooses to roll the red die that has more pips and two crash faces or the blue die with less pips and only one crash face. Along the Special stages are spaces that result in car damage if a player lands on those spaces. Prior to starting the race each player may place Repair Stations along the Road sections to repair damages incurred along the Specials stages. If a player lands on a Damage space in the first Special stage, that Damage penalty, 10 seconds, will be applied thereafter to each section until the player meets the requirement for entering one of his Repair Stations.  The player who completes the three Legs in the fastest time wins the rally/game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Basically a roll and move game with a bit of flare within the theme of the sport as it was conducted at the time of the game's production.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This being a game for the Pirelli tire company, there is more information concerning tires in the game materials than is necessary to play the game.  The only tyres available are from Pirelli and the game materials seek to show how each tyre should be used, with the rulebook containing a lot of information about how rallies were organized and run at that time and how to choose tyres for each stage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
