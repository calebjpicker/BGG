						               													<description>BattleAxe&amp;#10;by Nick Ryan&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BattleAxe is an dark age battlefield warefare simulation tabletop game for 2 players (or 2 teams) that allows the players to use their strategic skills against each others armies. The main goal is to kill the opponent's King. Each army consists of 26 numbered men, 2 warhorses. Your army including axe-men, spearmen, swordsmen, archers, an engineer, horsemen and 1 king, all with different and balanced attributes. The fighting/attacking mechanism is an elegant 1 to 3 custom dice rolling system. Each player has the exact same army, similar to Chess, as to see which player really has superior strategic skills. Asymmetrical games can also be played with endless scenarios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has an &amp;quot;Army Map&amp;quot; sheet for his army which illustrates and keeps track of each warrior and warhorse. Each man in your army has his own health meter, skills, attributes, and even a place for the player to name them. This gives an unparalleled  up-close-and-personal view from the battlefield. Engineers are a big part of the game, they can cut down trees, construct archer towers to enhance their attack range, walls, fire trenches and even make extra arrows for your archers. The concept of fire, from fire arrows and fire trenches symbolized by &amp;quot;wild fire&amp;quot; tiles are also a big part of the game. Fire can spread and take down your walls and towers which creates a real feel of the chaos of war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's who the better strategic commander is, not who can level up faster with fairy dust and gold coins.&amp;#10;It's dividing and concurring enraged enemy forces, not gathering grain for the winter.&amp;#10;It's swiftly destroying the opposing King and all his men to become the one true King of the battlefield.&amp;#10;It's BattleAxe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
