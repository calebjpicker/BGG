						               													<description>DOGFIGHT @ ALAM HALFA&amp;#10;Rommel's Strike for Cairo, Sept. 1942&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rommel's last offensive in the desert was a compelling one. He knew his past successes were waning for a variety of reasons and that unless&amp;#10;something changed, he would be at the end of his logistical tether. By August, 1942, he was fast approaching a turning point and he feared&amp;#10;his luck might run out. Thus, once he secured promises of adequate fuel supplies that would be delivered by the Italian Navy and Luftwaffe,&amp;#10;this Fox planned for a knock-out blow that some call Gazala II in strategy. A wide sweeping ride though sands of the desert during the&amp;#10;night, a ride some 40 miles in the moonlight to rear of the British forces at Alam Halfa. Rommel chose the night to hide his movements, his&amp;#10;intelligence indicated the mines were nil and no British forces were so far south. The Italian armor divisions, the Littorio and Ariete,&amp;#10;with over 150 M13 tanks (its 47mm gun could knock out most of the British tanks) would help seal the flanks of the 15th and 21st Panzer&amp;#10;Divisions (with over 100 tanks) along with the 90th Division. Rommel was banking on the British performance at Gazala, which showed when&amp;#10;cut off, the British acted in a confused state. Once the pocket was dealt with, each panzer would strike for the Nile, Cairo and&amp;#10;Alexandria. Besides, Hitler insisted Rommel attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each hex is one mile.&amp;#10;AFV units equal 8 AFV&amp;#10;Each turn is 4 hrs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
