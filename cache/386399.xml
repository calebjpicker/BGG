						               													<description>Orbit Master is a trick-taking strategy card game that is based on the Zodiac. In a turn by turn gameplay, players choose 1 Sign to play and the first player to build a House of the other 11 Signs under their Master Sign wins the game. But beware, the 13th Sign Ophiuchus can poison your Master Sign and change the course of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 12 signs of the Zodiac have existed in peaceful harmony since the beginning of time. However, the murmurs of a 13th sign have persisted without worry until now. The Snake Bearer, otherwise known as Ophiuchus has taken drink of the snakes venom and become corrupt with poisonous power. That poison has opened a black hole ripping the Celestial Orbit asunder releasing the balance of the 12 signs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Celestial Orbit needs to be restored, but with an Orbit Master to keep its hold. Which sign has the ability to muster the other 11 signs to re-establish the orbit?  And which sign can keep itself from being poisoned by Ophiuchus as well?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player must choose a sign to play and the first to bring the other 11 signs under their house becomes the Orbit Master!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
