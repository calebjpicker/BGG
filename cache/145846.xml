						               													<description>The Story&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Triple-G is known to many different peoples and creatures by many different names, but most of them know it as the Grey-Green Giant.   It is a very large world located in the Interior of the Expanse, almost directly in the center of Trader's Void.  You would think then that it is a vast hub of activity, given its location, but alas it is not.  You see, for a very very very long time the Gibs and Nowans have slaughtered each other all across the Expanse, and a good-sized majority of that slaughter has happened on Triple-G.  All living things on Triple-G have lived under the constant yoke of their terrible war, until recently... when they vanished!  No one knows why, not that anyone even knows why they were fighting in the first place, but they left Triple-G, and according to rumors, they left the rest of the Expanse as well, and slinked off to their homeworlds to do Void knows what.  And who cares! Because they're gone, it's a miracle, and needless to say, there has been much celebrating.  It is an exciting time to be alive, to be a free person, to be an info collector, to be anyone on Triple-G, but unfortunately we must remember that it is also an ominous time.  Though the Gibs and Nowans have left, they leave behind many vacuums.  Vacuums of space and power that will be quickly filled by the unknown.  Already there are stirrings in the shadows of the townes, and though for the first time in a long long time there are brave travelers heading outside the gates, most never return.  When you consider what you are going to do now, you must exercise extreme caution, and realize the effect your actions will have.  Our eyes need to be wide open, and our minds sharp, both inside the gates, and out.  It is a delicate time in the Expanse, so we must tread delicately.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kav Moggleberry, Expert Info Collector - Address to new travellers at the first traveller's guild annual raffle and bake sale&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tired of the cowards that huddle in fear in the stronghold of Gorth, you gear up and head outside the gates into the unknown landscape.  Explore ruins, find ancient destroyed cities, discover strange abandoned sites, experience new creatures, meet new cultures, but most importantly... find out more about the ominous unknown threat that whispers in the shadows, and threatens all of the free peoples of Triple-G!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Development&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Currently playtesting Zone 1: The Green Hills of Gorthicon - Players must clear the Lost Pass before the Ominous Whispers track gets to 6.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
