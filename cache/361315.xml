						               													<description>Building on the innovative gameplay of his Fast Action Battle (FAB) Series, designer Rick Young has reimagined the best parts of FAB to introduce a new game system: Battle Command. The goal of the Battle Command system is to provide a fresh and engaging way for various conflicts across different eras to be fought with minimal time wasted on setup and complex rules, making this both a great introductory system for new and veteran players alike. &amp;#10; Each Battle Command volume includes TWO different games in one box. Volume I brings players to the forests of the Battle of the Bulge, and the sun, heat, and sand of North Africa during Operation Crusader. The design emphasis has been placed on making the game very player-friendly and manageable in its level of scope, difficulty, and time of play. With a low total counter count and density, these quick playing (though still realistic) simulations present players with deep strategy meriting contemplation. A system of map areas has been adopted, and movement has been streamlined.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For those who prefer to use a paper map, or who would like to be able to set up both games side by side, we are including a double-sided paper map along with the double-sided mounted map. This is for those of you who have 3 friends who would like to play, or play at conventions, or just plain prefer a paper map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battle Command (BC) is a refinement and simplification of the old Fast Action Battles (FAB) game series. Those familiar with the FAB games will recognize that the scope is the same, with higher echelons, artillery, events, and combat assets that can be assigned as available. FAB however was rules intensive and procedural, and those elements have been streamlined in the BC series. Most players do not need to pick up the rulebook after the first turn or two, as everything you need to play has been printed on the map, including a flow-chart with extended sequence of play so that no turn segment will be overlooked, and your attention will be placed solely on the battle at hand. Special rules needed for each event are printed directly on the event cards, so you can play them and forget them without having to refer to the rulebook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;Two Rulebooks&amp;#10;220 playing cards (110 per game)&amp;#10;1 double-sided mounted map (34&amp;quot;x22&amp;quot;) with one game on each side&amp;#10;1 double-sided paper map (34&amp;quot;x22&amp;quot;) with one game on each side&amp;#10;2 counter sheets&amp;#10;4 Player Aids&amp;#10;2 dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
