						               													<description>In this family game Kvantum (Quantum) you become captains of spaceships! Navigate your spaceships with the help of cute aliens to reach the planet Quantum first. You can find your way to it if you put the navigation cards with numbers correctly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game will not only help practice tactical thinking, but it also tests basic speed counting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to use the alien cards to put together the correct numbers (quanta) and reach the planet Quantum first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PREPARATION OF THE GAME&amp;#10;Place the game board in the middle of the table. You can choose from two track lengths. Shuffle the alien cards and place them face down near the game board.&amp;#10;Each player chooses a piece, places it on the start and takes five alien cards from the refi lling pack into their hand.&amp;#10;Place the shuffled navigation cards with the planets face down next to the game plan.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COURSE OF THE GAME&amp;#10;Select the starting player who becomes the captain. The game is played in rounds, each round has four phases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) Course settings&amp;#10;The captain turns over the navigation card with the planet on it.&amp;#10;Each player tries as quickly as possible to find the sum of the numbers on the cards in their hand that will result in the same number as the number on the laid out navigation card.&amp;#10;Once the player finds the correct cards, they lay them out in front of them. If a player cannot make a number, they can lay out just one card of the same colour as the number on the planet navigation card.&amp;#10;The player who laid out the cards as last or cannot lay out anything cannot fly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) Flight&amp;#10;If the players have laid out the cards correctly (sum or colour), they may keep the cards laid out and arrange them on the table in front of them. If not, they throw these cards away.&amp;#10;Players who have laid out their cards correctly will move up the game board by the number of fields corresponding to the number of cards they have laid out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3) Alien technology&amp;#10;The alien cards that players have laid out in front of them have various effects that can be used to advance towards the objective.&amp;#10;If a player uses four cards of the same colour with any values, they move their rocket (figure) three fields forward. Each type (colour) of alien has a different special ability. If you manage to create a sequence of four cards of the same colour (e.g. 3, 4, 5, 6), you can use special alien technology.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4) Energy replenishment&amp;#10;All players may discard any number of cards from their hand to the discard pack. Players then take turns taking cards from the refi lling pack so that they have five in their hand. The player to the left of the captain takes the pack of navigation cards and becomes the captain for the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;END OF THE GAME&amp;#10;The game ends on the round when the first player reaches the Quantum planet. The other players fi nish the round. If more players reach the destination during the last round, they all win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
