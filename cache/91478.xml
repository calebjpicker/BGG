						               													<description>After developing Raiding Stonehenge, it became apparent the game was best suited for 4-5 players. This meant the initial 2-3 players planned for the gamer were dropped and put into the unrecommended category. Seeing that Raiding Stonehenge was a good game, and feeling a need to come up with more 2 player Euro-style games, I decided to adapt Raiding Stonehenge to two players. Raiding Duel is the result.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Number of players: 2&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object of the game: The object of the game is to score the most points after two rounds of play. Players score 10 points for each complete set of disks they collect at end of game. A set normally contains one disk of each color: White, red, green, blue, yellow. Players LOSE one point for each disk not in a set.&amp;#10;Getting Started&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment: Deck of 60 cards, excluding the Trilithon cards. 50 disks, 10 per color. Each disk type represents a different item type from Camelot. 1 gray figure (to indicate start player). A way to track score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending the Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the second round is over, the game ends. At that point, game is over, and players total up their points for both rounds. The player with the most points wins. In event of a tie, players keep playing two cards from their hand, as they have done prior. until they are down to only two cards. The player with the highest card in their hand wins. If both players tie, they each look for the next highest card in their hand. If, after that, the players are still tied, the game ends in a tie.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
