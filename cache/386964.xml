						               													<description>Tabernacle of Yahweh is a resource and worker placement Board Game based on a defining period in the history on the nation of Israel. Described in the Bible from the Book of Exodus 25 the Tribes of Israel, after the Exodus from Egypt, are called to bring voluntary offerings to construct a Tabernacle (Heb: Mishkan) or Dwelling Place for Yahweh, the God of Israel, and all the objects pertaining to it:&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 'Speak to the children of Israel that they bring Me an offering. You shall take an offering from every man that gives it willingly with his heart. And this is the offering which you shall take of them: gold, and silver, and bronze, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and rams' skins dyed red, and fine leather, and acacia-wood, oil for the light, spices for anointing oil and for sweet incense, onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate. And let them make Me a Sanctuary, so that I may dwell among them.' &amp;rdquo; (Exodus 25:1-8)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes control of a Tribe, and beginning with three, will collect resources by either rolling each Tribe member's die or placing their die on the Action Board and use those resources to expand their tribe and fill requirements for the construction of the Tabernacle. Resources have differing values and will receive varying points by placing them on the Tabernacle Board, thus bringing the game to an end when all spaces are filled. Through strategic use of resources and a bit of luck, the Tribe with the most points at this time will be declared the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
