						               													<description>Stack 'Em 5 is a highly addictive, unique new board game that has aspects of several classics before it, such as chess, checkers, tic-tac-toe, Connect 4, Go, and even Pente, but on a whole new level, or should I say levels. Think of it as 3D connect 5 on gogo juice! And, unlike all its predecessors, and most strategy games of today, Stack'Em 5 allows for more than 2 players at a time. That being said, it is an incredibly strategic battle for 2 players, however as many as 7 can enjoy it, but with 8 or more we wont take responsibility for what might happen next. You and your family &amp;amp; friends will find a new meaning of competitiveness, making Monopoly Night look like a calm night! It's extremely simple to learn for even the youngest gamer, but will take years to master its strategies, making it challenging for the veteran player as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Strategy 101: Every single move counts in the which players try to achieve 5 in-a-row, ball by ball! The fundamental rules take less than a minute to learn, yet the game has the complexity to engage both beginners and experts alike - perfect for the entire family!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stack 'Em 5 Rules!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player chooses a color and takes a set of balls. Players take turns stacking balls on the board, the first player starts by placing his/her first ball within the 9 center rods, after which point play is open to any of the 49 rods. Each and every ball is stacked strategically so that 5-in-a-row is accomplished vertically, horizontally, or diagonally just so long as it forms a straight line from point to point with NO turns. Easy Right! The rotation of play is counter-clockwise with a time limit of 30 seconds per turn,  keeping you on your toes. The board itself spins completely around, either left or right on the center rod, giving the current player the ability to look at all the different angles. Only the current player may move the board, and he/she may do so as mush as they like, until the end of their turn. Once a ball is stacked, it cannot be removed or placed elsewhere, and the players turn is over. There are no restrictions on how balls of different colors are stacked. You may put a ball on any of the 49 rods that are open. Once 7 balls occupy a rod, that rod is full, giving the players a total of 343 possible positions on the board. The goal is to simply block your opponent from getting 5-in-a-row while strategically placing your balls to do just that. Be tactical. Obstruct your opponent(s) while expanding your own &amp;ldquo;territory&amp;rdquo;. The game ends when a player has been able to link 5-in-a-row in any way possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
