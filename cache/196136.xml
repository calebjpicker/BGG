						               													<description>Overview&amp;#10;Eastern Blades is the samurai card dueling game we have all been waiting for. Players will adopt one style of the characters dealt to them at the beginning of the game. Then all players will battle for supremacy using their character to defeat all comers. Game play is designed to depict extremely faced paced sword duels on the battlefield. 2-5 players will take part using only the core game. Games last 10 to 15 minutes. Expansions are planned to begin in early 2017.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play&amp;#10; After selecting their character players get  ready for the coming onslaught by selecting stances, choosing an attack or item and finalizing their plan of attack. However, we all know that on the battlefield even the best laid plans do not survive contact with the enemy. Players will simultaneously select their actions and who they will attack each round. Upon being attacked combatants will be able to parry or even redirect the attack just like in a true sword fight. This &amp;ldquo;ebb and flow&amp;rdquo; of combat will persist as long as it takes to declare a winner. This is no easy task as every decision will devastate either your enemy or yourself. You will inevitably find yourself asking questions like what stance I  need to be in next, should I block or should I hold for a bigger attack, is the opponent faking their threat level, and can I get my attack off before theirs? In any event this high stakes sword fight will have you coming back again and again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How do we know you will like it?&amp;#10;BC Games focuses on making quality games over a quantity of games. For this game we consulted Marty Katz Shihan, Shichidan (7th Dan in Bushido), founder of Bushido Karate Dojo in an effort to add a large shot of realism to the flow of the game. We even had the maneuvers translated into Japanese (with subtitles) and cross referenced them so some of the maneuvers block and counter others specifically like they do in the real world. You will enjoy this game for its realism and attention to detail regarding the art of Bushido and the way of the warrior. The Samurai put all they had into their training and ability as an honorable but lethal force at the altar of war. Now you can live out your dream of an amazing duel of your own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
