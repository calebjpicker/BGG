						               													<description>The Age of Sigmar: Fury of the Deep set gives you everything you will need to&amp;nbsp;create&amp;nbsp;a battle between the Fyreslayers and the Idoneth Deepkin, it's packed full of enough miniatures to literally start a war as well as rules, lore, Warscrolls and more. Including two never before seen miniatures, Akhelian Thrallmaster and The Auric Flamekeeper. These models will lead the two armies into battle, but who will come out on top is down to you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fyreslayers are born from the furnaces deep within mountain vaults, bellowing mighty war cries as they charge into the fray swinging their deadly battle axes. They carry little in the way of armour to protect themselves, instead blessed with the power of their God magical ur-gold runes that are seared into their flesh, allowing their God's power to flow through their veins and provide them with abilities of more resilient skin and increased strength to cleave their enemies in two and shrug off wounds that would slay a normal warrior. What drives the Duardin Fyreslayers ever on is the promise of gold to be won, to fulfil their oaths by vanquishing their enemies and the chance to honour the spirit of Grimnir.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Idoneth Deepkin are a cursed people. When Teclis took his due of Aelven souls from the captive Slaanesh he crafted a new race that he hoped would embody the virtues of the Aelves from the world that was. He failed. The creatures he created were not untainted by their time within the God of Excess, holding within themselves a deep well of darkness. Horrified at his failure, Teclis attempted to eradicate his newly created children but could not act before they fled, far into the deepest oceans of the Ethersea. There they multiplied only to discover to their horror that the majority of their children possessed withered souls. Few survived beyond birth and fewer still to adulthood so a decision was made. In order to safeguard the lives of those few children that survived the Idoneth would need to graft healthy souls to theirs thus do the Idoneth venture into the mortal realms on raids to enslave living captives to be donors and ensure the future of their race.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
