						               													<description>In the early months of 1943, the United States and British Commonwealth forces had finally defeated Rommel and the axis armies of North Africa. The allied leaders were in disagreement on what the next step should be; invade Italy, the Balkans, or France. Stalin was desperate to open another front in Europe. Churchill wanted to invade Italy which he labeled &amp;ldquo;the soft underbelly of the Axis&amp;rdquo;. It was agreed that since no invasion of Northern France could be undertaken in 1943, that the invasion of Sicily would take place. The allied commanders were sure that invading Italy would all but destroy the Italians will to fight, and maybe the government and Mussolini would be overthrown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The German high command was also aware that Italy&amp;rsquo;s support for the war was dwindling. German units that were needed for the Eastern front were sent to Italy to help defend against an allied attack and to police the Italian army in case of a coup. With most of Germany&amp;rsquo;s army and supplies on the Eastern front and a weakening ally in Italy, Germany is desperate to keep the allies out of Southern Europe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Invasion of Italy is an Axis &amp;amp; Allies style game that puts you in the seat of the Axis commanders who are racing to get their army into a position to defend Southern Europe, and Allied commanders who are ready to open another front in Europe to relieve the Russians on the Eastern front. Will you follow history as the allies and invade Sicily and then Italy, or will you try to take Rome first and severe the Axis army in Europe? Can the Axis hold out long enough with their limited supplies, or will Italy fall and leave Germany defending Italy&amp;hellip;..ALONE?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game features a map of Italy (36&amp;quot; x 48&amp;quot;)(91 cm x 122 cm) divided into controllable territories. One player plays the side of the Axis controlling the Italian and German units defending Italy against the Allied Invasion. The other player controls the Allies who have 20 turns to take as many victory cities as possible before the Germans can reinforce Italy. Game uses a D12 combat system and pieces from the Axis &amp;amp; Allies series of games and is a variant of these games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game comes with map , rules, and some units. You will need additional pieces to play the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
