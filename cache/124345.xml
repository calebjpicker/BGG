						               													<description>In the game there are 8 Player Characters that form the Player Character Deck. Each turn 2 random characters are discarded and then the players secretly choose the Player Character they will play in the current turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Player Character has 2 unique abilities. The first ability may be used on any turn, however the second ability may only be used in Chapters that the Player Character appears in the book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Secondly, we have the Story Decks which are composed of: Characters, Quotations, and Objects from the book. There are Story Decks for all 12 chapters of the book. Each card may be played for its cost in the Chapter it appears in. Character and Object cards have a Story Point value that adds to a Player's score. Quotation cards are used to complete a Chapter, which is accomplished by playing 3 cards in the appropriate Chapter, but have no Story Point value. Completed Chapters double the points scored while incomplete Chapters score only the card's combined Story Point value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You may have noticed that I mentioned the cost of playing a card. In Alice: Adventures in Wonderland the currency we use is Tarts. One of the actions a player may take on their turn is taking Tarts. The Tarts are  used to play Story cards. Player's must carefully balance the number of Tarts they have in their possession, because at the end of the game any Tarts they have will count against their final score. They lose 1 Story Point for every Tart they did not return to the tray.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board we use in the game is called the Storyboard. Alice travels along a pathway from one chapter to the next, spending only a few turns in most chapters. When Alice moves into a new chapter, cards that players may have in their hands from a previous chapter may no longer be played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Along the perimeter of the Storyboard is a Story Point Tracker. At the end of each Chapter, players score the cards they played (doubled if they played 3 cards) and all cards from the Chapter (in their hands, played in front of them, or remaining in the chapter's Story Deck) are removed from the game. There is also a Tart Tracker that represents the current number of Tarts each player has in their possession.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, Alice is not a Player Character. She is not even a character in the Story Deck. In the game she is represented by a token that moves along a pathway through each chapter. She is a basically a timer. When the Alice token reaches the final space,  the game is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
