						               													<description>Preparation:&amp;#10;Each player receives a ship and the 15 balls of one color, which he places in the hold of his own ship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roll of the dice:&amp;#10;In turn, the players roll the two dice and advance three balls at the same time through the game circuit as many squares as there are points on the dice. If a star comes out on the roll of the dice, the three balls are advanced as many squares as the other dice indicates, and if the two stars come out, the Discomatic mechanism moves in the direction indicated by the arrow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game system:&amp;#10;On each game turn, after the dice are rolled, each player must advance three balls consecutively placed on the board: if the ball located in advance is advanced, the two balls immediately behind must also advance; if you want to advance a ball located in between the heading ball and your boat hold, you must advance those located at its same point of advance or immediately behind it; if you want to play a ball that has not yet entered play, you must advance two others that are still in your own boat (in your side of the board).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The balls, which can only circulate in one direction: towards the opposing boat, can go ahead passing one over the other (even if they are from opposing sides).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each square there can only be one ball, and if it falls on the square occupied by an opposing ball, it is taken prisoner and placed in the hold of the own ship. This rule also applies to orange squares.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prisoner rescue:&amp;#10;When, with an exact roll of the dice, with no remaining points, a ball manages to reach an orange square on the opposing ship, it frees as many prisoners as there are points indicated by the immediate roll of a die. If a star appears, the roll is repeated. The ball that has reached the opposing boat is removed from play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of game:&amp;#10;The first player who manages to get six balls to the opposing boat wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
