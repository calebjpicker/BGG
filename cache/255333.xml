						               													<description>Free game published in the January 2018 (GTM #215) issue of Game Trade Magazine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Muses Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Background:&amp;#10;The Nine Muses of the Old World were crafted as courtly educators and advisors, always on hand to help the young princes and princesses reach their full potential. &amp;ldquo;Nine Virtues&amp;rdquo; is&amp;#10;a card game about excelling in all the best aspects of life.&amp;#10;In the game of Nine Virtues, players try to collect hands of&amp;#10;the most valuable virtues, and to take pride in owning them.&amp;#10;But the greatest risk is to claim a virtue you do not possess!&amp;#10;The game is played in rounds, with each player dealing once.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment:&amp;#10;A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Round: &amp;#10;Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. Then deal two cards per player face up into the center of the table. For example, if there are five players, deal ten cards face up in the center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turns:&amp;#10;Play starts on the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left and proceeds clockwise. On your turn, you must do one of the following:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bid: Take a card from the middle of the table and keep it&amp;#10;face up in front of you. This is called &amp;ldquo;taking a bid.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;Exception: The 1 is wild, and can&amp;rsquo;t be taken as a bid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Swap: Exchange a card in your hand with a card in the&amp;#10;middle. The card you take goes into your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kill: Choose any card in the center and discard it. You&amp;#10;cannot do this until each player has had one turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The round ends when there are no cards left in the center.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring: &amp;#10;The player who holds the most cards in each rank scores points equal to that rank. For example, you will score four points if you hold the most fours. (Bid cards are not in your hand.) If there is a tie, all tied players score the full value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Calling the 1: &amp;#10;Before scoring begins, the player who holds the 1 must declare what rank it will become. It is important to do this before players reveal their hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After this, go up through the ranks and determine who has&amp;#10;the most of each. You can set cards aside to tally your score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bids: Each bid you make is a claim that you will hold the&amp;#10;most cards of that suit. If you have the most (or are tied for&amp;#10;the most), then each bid card is worth its face value. If you&amp;#10;were wrong, then each bid is worth negative points. If no one holds any cards of the bid rank, then all players are tied at zero. They score zero points for cards in their hands, but bids in that rank are worth their face value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Final Score: A full game is one round for each player. The&amp;#10;player with the highest total score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
