						               													<description>Overview:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game &amp;quot;Mines of Goldstett&amp;quot; there are two opponent teams, Kobolds and Goblins playing against each other. Each team consists of 1-2 players and competes either for the gold reserves or the supremacy in the mines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In short: &amp;quot;Mines of Goldstett&amp;quot; is a tactical, team worker placement game played on a modular, modifiable board, therefore every single match is unique. The game is designed to grant an easy access for new players, while it is hard to master it`s full tactical opportunities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Story:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At a time when kobolds and goblins were still resident in Goldstett, a deep vein of gold was found within the local mines. Both parties heard about the good news at the same time. The kobolds were happy, as it was enough gold to bury it at the end of the rainbow.  On the other hand the goblins would rather invest the gold to attend the &amp;quot;All-You-Can-Drink&amp;quot; event in their local pub... However, the fact that both parties had their eyes on the gold vein poses a problem for the opponents: the gold was not enough for everyone, and even though the kobolds and the goblins were equally good at digging and making tools, they were awful fighters. So both decided on their own to intimidate the rivaling party with elaborately crafted weapons and to chase them out of the caves...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn consist of 3 parts. &amp;#10;-The active player rolls the dice (2x 10d-dices)&amp;#10; Those indicate which tunnel plates yield resources.&amp;#10; Each player occupying the corresponding plates draws resource cards.&amp;#10;-The active player may then move his 3 worker on any tile that is attached to his tunnel system&amp;#10;-and perform one action.&amp;#10; Each worker may either:&amp;#10; 1) dig to exchange the tunnel plate he/she is standing on&amp;#10; 2) attach on unoccupied plate to the tunnel system of the  &amp;#10;    player&amp;#10; 3)or frighten away a rival worker&amp;#10; To frighten away a rival worker the player needs to equip &amp;#10;enough resource cards to reach a suitable frightening level,&amp;#10;while the rival players may use their resource cards, to reduce the effect of the players invasion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The team that either occupies the goldmine in the center&amp;#10;long enough to get 9 gold pieces or banishes on rival player from his/her cave wins the match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player may support his/her teammate with resource cards at any given time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If there are less than 4 players, players may also utilize the workers and cave from their &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; teammate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
