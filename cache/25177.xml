						               													<description>This is a game for ages 10 and up. The box contains a board, a wooden champagne bottle, 48 cards, 6 party characters and 20 chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board shows 6 persons who are more or less undressed. In the middle of the board there is a tract on which the champaign bottle is moving. The tract contains 4 kinds of fields.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards are showing a number value of a special symbol. The party characters are the ones also showed on the board. But now they are dressed and each character is split in 4 parts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes place in front of one of the characters on the board and gets the 4 pieces of his character. These pieces have to be put on the picture on the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aim of the game is to stay dressed as long as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each players gets 3 cards from the shuffled stack, the rest of the cards are put aside the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn you play one of your cards and you draw one new card from the stack. If a numbered card is played , the champaign bottle is moved accordingly on the tract. You get a chip when the bottle lands on a dark green field, you have to give a chip if the bottle lands on a red field. Landing on a light green field results in nothing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On passing the start field with the bottle, a piece of clothing has to be removed from your character. This can only be prevented by playing one of the 4 special cards instead of a numbered card. When playing the R-card, you can leave the bottle where it is and the player on your right is on turn. If you play the card with a rectangle on it, the next player has to remove a piece of clothing from his character. Playing the card with a star on it brings you right to the start field and playing the card with a question mark on it causes your left neighbor to draw a card and play that card immediately.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The chips have a special meaning. Each player can only have max. 3 of those chips. When playing a card the use of a chip allows you to lower the number of fields you have to move by one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends as soon as one of the characters is completely in his underwear. The winner is the character which is still most dressed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
