						               													<description>Quick Draw is a card came designed for 2-4 players whereby each player takes on the role of a Gunfighter in the old west. Each player begins the game with 30 life points, you can use glass beads or pen and paper to keep track of the life points. You will need a standard pack of cards that have 2 jokers, and around 10-15 six sided dice (less depending on number of players).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is divided into turns with each turn being made up of 3 rounds; Quick Draw, Aim and Fire. At the start of a turn the players are dealt 10 cards and then 5 communal cards are played face up in the middle of the play area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For each round the players must use three cards from their hand to make the best poker hand they can. They place each round of cards face down in front of them (3 stacks of 3 cards). The left stack are the cards used for the Quick Draw round, the middle stack is used for the Aim Round and the Right Stack is used for the Fire Round. The last remaining card is placed to the very right of the Fire Stack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all of the players have made their selection all of the stacks of cards and the remaining card are turned over, spread out and revealed for all to see, then each player places 2d6 on top of their remaining card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting with the Quick Draw Round, the poker hands are compared, players call out their best hand in turn giving the other players the opportunity to challenge their call. Once all hands have been called, the highest scoring player performs the action from the table below using the quick draw column and cross referencing it with his poker hand, once his action has been completed the next highest highest player performs their action in the same way, this continues until all player have taken an action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play moves to the Aim round which is repeated exactly as with the quick draw round and then the Fire round is performed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the dice are rolled in the Fire Round, their result is deducted directly from the player to the left or right of the active player who may choose either one. If a player ends with a negative results, then they take the damage themselves. When instructed to add or deduct dice in the fire round, just add or deduct the dice as directed to or from the remaining card of the player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
