						               													<description>Gravity Falls: Quest for the Ultimate Summer Adventure is a fan-made adaptation of the Disney series Gravity Falls: The now-13 year-old Pines twins return to Gravity Falls with dreams of having another amazing summer adventure with their friends, but it's not starting out to be much of an adventure. Waddles has been banned from the bus system and had to stay behind in Piedmont, Stan and Ford are both off on their own adventures in parts unknown and Wendy got a new job outside of town! Tourism is way down and business is not good at the Mystery Shack so far either. Soos has been nice enough to let Dipper and Mabel stay in the Mystery Shack attic again as his guests, but what's the point? It starts to seem like the twins aren't going to re-live another 'amazing summer' after all... that is until Candy, Grenda, Pacifica, and Gideon pay a surprise visit to the twins. They tell the twins tales of new strange things going on in town and how the four of them have been out adventuring every day and are now on a quest to get to the bottom of all this new weirdness. For Mabel and Dipper, nothing sounds better than a Quest for the Ultimate Summer Adventure in Gravity Falls!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players assume the role of one or more of the Gravity Falls characters: Dipper, Mabel, Candy, Grenda, Pacifica, or Gideon. Each character has unique abilities and each can be &amp;quot;leveled-up&amp;quot; to further expand their uniqueness. Players take turns moving their character(s) on the game board, which is a representation of the Gravity Falls townsite and surrounding area. On each board space a player may choose to stop and perform an action, such as visiting local shops to purchase equipment, supplies, or items to use as weapons, or they may &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot; their current location. Searching requires players to draw a card from the Search Deck, which contains random events, Foes, and item cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Encounters with enemies (Foes) requires that characters first make a &amp;quot;Fear Test&amp;quot;, pitting their own &amp;quot;Weirdness&amp;quot; against their newly-encountered Foe. The game also employs a &amp;quot;Fear Tracker&amp;quot; which has increasing threat levels indicating how frightened the characters are at the moment. When the Fear level is low, creatures like a Gremgoblin or Giant Fruit Bat may not seem so scary at all. But, as the Fear level increases, it is possible that even encountering cute critters like Fairies, Beavers or a Snake-Badger (or is it a Snadger?) may be terrifying causing characters to initially flee before they are willing to re-consider engaging in battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Games may be played using a fully randomized game board and Search deck, or players may use the Quest book that is included with the rules to play through a story-driven series of increasingly difficult Quests to discover what is behind these strange goings-on in Gravity Falls. For each of these Quests that are completed the players may draw a single Treasure card, which is often a rare or unique item that they can keep or trade in to the Mystery Shack in exchange for in-game bonuses or perks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
