						               													<description>My name is Mike McKinstry and I am the host of the award winning TV show, &amp;rdquo;The Bassquatch Hunter&amp;rdquo; where we take out guests from different industries and sports that followed their dreams to do what they love just like I did with fishing!&amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;Now we have a board game to help spread our love for the sport and inspire others to FIND THEIR BASSQUATCH!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We started this game because there was a big gap in the market for teaching kids how fishing tournaments work, fish identification and size expectations and also a fun way to share what the awesome sport of fishing is all about!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is not just about fishing. This is the story of Seth being brave enough to meet his first human, learn how to fish and then use his passion for the sport to teach everyone he meets about how much fun it is to hunt for your own Bassquatch!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fish On! is a chance to fish in Seth Squatch's world as Seth. You can catch a Largemouth bass, Smallmouth bass, Blue Gill or a Northern Pike when you land on a &amp;quot;FISH ON!&amp;quot; spot.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You could also catch Seaweed (grass bass), Sticks (tree pounder) or get hooked on a stump if you do not pull a fish card or any of the other obstacles mixed into the deck.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can circle the island and hit all of the best fishing spots until a player decides to cross the finish line and end the game. At this time, each player adds up their fish either by inches or pounds to see who has the largest amount of size or weight in their nets!&amp;nbsp;&amp;#10; This game will help with basic math skills, Fish identification, size expectations and a very fun adventure for kids. The Fish On! game is also a big hit for adults to play against their buddies! The competitive trash talking begins after the first roll of the dice usually. This game operates very similar to a fishing tournament so even if you are a non fisherman, it will be fun, competitive and educational for all!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You never know, your next adventure could lead you to be the next Bassquatch Hunter!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
