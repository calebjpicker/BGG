						               													<description>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prospectica is a 2 to 4 player card game with a theme of mining asteroids in space.  The object of the game is to be the first player to successfully find, seed and mine three unique asteroids.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The gameplay changes depending on your starship and various upgrades you may attach to it such as Engines, Drills and Storage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These upgrades can affect your the number of cards you may draw, how many minerals you can mine and how many cards you can hold in your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns drawing from the draw pile or discard pile.  The goal is to draw a small, medium and large asteroid from the deck and play them face up in front of the player.  Once at least on asteroid is played, the player can then begin to seed the asteroid with mineral cards (also found in the deck).&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;There are six unique minerals, and each asteroid has a requirement of how many minerals are needed to seed it.  Once a player has the correct number of minerals for the asteroid, they play them on top of the face up asteroids they have discovered so far.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The final step for the player is to mine the minerals on a fully seeded asteroid.  Players only seed and mine their own asteroids.  To mine an asteroid, the player must use a pricing contract card (found throughout the deck).  These pricing cards have various values from 20 to 120 and are an important part of the scoring.  The player is allowed to mine one mineral for each drill on their starship per contract card they hold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the player fully depletes an asteroid of minerals, they turn it sideways to score additional points. The first player to mine all three of the asteroids wins the hand, and all players tally their score up to that point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to reach 4000 points wins the game. This usually requires a multiple hands of play to achieve.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
