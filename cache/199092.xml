						               													<description>Meeple Maker is a 2-4 player light strategy game that plays in about 30-60 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your goal is to get the most fans. To get fans interested, you'll produce games tailored to their demands. To meet those demands, you'll develop content with help from the internet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns and either gain or spend content.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To gain content, they choose which website to move to from one of the next three clockwise websites (skipping over other players) and develop the content shown there (resources). Since each player's token never leaves the board and movement is limited, each move impacts the choices of others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players spend that content to grow their company, produce games, recruit people and get fans. All of these aspects are represented together on the cards in their hand or in the common market. These cards and their position determine the type and number of content that needs to be spent, as well as the skills (resource-gathering) and fans (score) the cards offer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Those cards join their tableau, growing your company and helping players develop immersive worlds (theme), deep mechanics (strategy), valuable components, and wondrous artwork (the four types of content).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As players grow their companies to new sizes, they'll choose and flip tokens on the board. This changes how much resources are available and also acts as the game clock. When the last (eighth) token changes, the final round is played out. During final scoring, players gain resources based on who they recruited, and then spend them to acquire the cards in their hand. The end-game conditions are checked to see who has the most theme, strategy, component and artwork skills in their company and who gets the bonus points. The player with the highest score, i.e. most fans, wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The setup is highly variable, with resources being randomly placed on the board, different values for the end game conditions, and a constantly evolving, sliding market.  There are also several creators to choose from, an evolving board and many ways to manipulate the game - so each game is a new challenge to face.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
