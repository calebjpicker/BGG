						               													<description>A game of Six Ways 2 Sunday is played over 2 rounds consisting of 6 tricks each. The catch is that the six tricks in each round are not played in sequence, but collectively. That is, a player might play a card to any of the 6 tricks on a given turn. Each trick is limited to 1 card less the number of players, thus not all players will participate in all 6 tricks. The tricks are only resolved when the last card valid card is played and all 6 tricks are completed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each trick is won by either the highest or lowest card played depending on the individual trick. Playing a losing card to any trick enables the player to take the special action associated with that trick's day:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monday: Lets a player move a previously played card.&amp;#10;Tuesday: Lets a player immediately take another turn.&amp;#10;Wednesday: Lets a player change the win condition (high vs Low) for any trick.&amp;#10;Thursday: Lets a player remove a card that has been played.&amp;#10;Friday: Lets a player swap the cards between any 2 tricks.&amp;#10;Saturday: Lets a player draw an extra card into their hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All players have an identical deck of 13 cards from which they will draw a hand of 4 cards. The game ends when the second round is completed.  Players score points for each trick taken and additional points for capturing other players' highest and lowest valued cards.&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every win comes with opportunity costs. Make a move to secure one goal and you might find yourself out of luck everywhere else you look. Every loss invites possibilities. Lose ground on one objective and you might just find new options emerge. Can you balance these factors to secure a win?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;'Six Ways 2 Sunday is a tricky trick-taking game about gaining control and seizing opportunities. In each of two rounds, players play to and compete in 6 tricks simultaneously. It takes more than winning tricks, though, because players also score for capturing their opponents&amp;rsquo; best cards. Careful timing and crafty play can turn the tables in the blink of an eye. Players must consider all options because there are Six Ways 2 Sunday and even more to victory!&amp;#10;- from back of box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
