						               													<description>Aloha! Adventures sail the oceans and hope to gain the favour of Kanaloa, the god of water, to get ahead fastest. He sends his spirits of the four elements, the Tikis, to assist them. But the Tikis' head are filled with nonsense and they try to trump each other. Kanaloa himself has to intervene to get everything back in line and protect the sailors from the danger of the shallows, the octopus. Who will claim victory with the help of the right Tikis and sail towards the sunset as the lucky winner?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aim of the game:&amp;#10;The aim is to take the most tricks by skillfully playing cards to get ahead as fast as possible with your boat and to outrun the slowest player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;The game consists of several rounds. One round is always played as follows:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The starting player opens a round by playing a card from their hand.&amp;#10;     The other players now also play one card each in turn.&amp;#10;     Check to see who took the trick. This player may move their boat forward to the next free water space. Any occupied spaces are skipped.&amp;#10;     Before the player who has taken the trick plays a card for the next trick, they announce the trump suit for the next trick out loud. The suit on the water space on which the leading boat is placed is always trumps.&amp;#10;     A round is finished once all cards have been played and 8 tricks have been taken.&amp;#10;     After the player who took the last trick has moved their boat forward, they remove any free water card from the sea route. So the sailing route gets shorter and shorter during the game.&amp;#10;     The player who took the last trick starts the next round. They shuffle all the cards, deal 8 cards to each player and lay a card for the first trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player&amp;lsquo;s boat laps the last boat on the sea route. This player wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
