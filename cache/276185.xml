						               													<description>You have been chosen to participate in a car race on a hidden, magical island. The island has transformed you into a specific character with unique powers and abilities. You must use them to help you win the race.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is to be the first player across the finish line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are three levels of play: &amp;#10;Beginner - Playing as yourself (without a character)&amp;#10;Intermediate (Basic Game) - Playing with a character&amp;#10;Advanced - Playing with a team of characters&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In a Basic Game, each player begins with a Guardian Card, a Dashboard a Turbo Card and a Character. The Guardian Card is a log of the training that you have received from the guardians of the island. The Dashboard contains a Health Meter which indicates the health of your character, a Damage Meter which indicates the condition of your vehicle and a Binoculars Meter which helps you look into the distance. The Turbo Card allows the player to take a Turbo Roll when rolling a 6. During the Turbo Roll the player is completely defenseless.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a player's turn, they can play any of their character powers and abilities. A player then rolls the High Speed Die to move their vehicle down the road (during certain times they must roll the Low Speed Die). They collect Game Cards and Coins along the way. They must traverse difficult terrain and battle hostile animals and other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each character has at least three unique powers and/or abilities. A &amp;quot;power&amp;quot; requires a player to spend tokens and are limited. An &amp;quot;ability&amp;quot; is constant throughout the entire game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are different areas of the board that present unique challenges, such as the quicksand, Gator Lake, Wildebeest Canyon, Rickety Bridge, Andy Straightaway-Ice Road, and finding their way out of Tarancon Volcano.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are friendly animals which help you such as Jora-The Lion which provides you with strength which is used in battling, the cheetah which provides you with speed, the meercats which energize your binoculars and others which provide you with coins to buy items at the Trading Post.&amp;#10; There are four hidden paths. The player who possesses the compass is able to find and go through these paths. Other players may steal the compass.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During certain conditions, Game Cards can be flipped. If so, the player cannot use them. To un-flip them, the player must roll a 4 and choose not to move their vehicle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when the first player crosses the finish line. The next closest player is declared 2nd Place and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is also tournament format. A tournament is when 2 to 5 players have agreed to participate in 10 races. During tournament play, points are awarded for pole position and guardian training. The winner of the tournament is the player with the most points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
