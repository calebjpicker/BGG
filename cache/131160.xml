						               													<description>A children's card game set in the universe of the 2011 live action/CGI animated television series &amp;quot;Mia and me&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Background story: Centopia's unicorns are in danger! Collect as many unicorn tears as possible, find all parts of the golden Trumptus and skillfully use the elves' weapons to fend off the evil Panthea.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aim of the game: Collect the most valuable cards to reach the highest number of points and win the game. The game ends when all pieces of the Trumptus have been found. The unicorns will be safe from Panthea!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: The cards are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. The youngest player turns over the top card. He/she may also turn over several cards. But it is possible that he/she doesn't get to keep any of them so players should consider carefully how big a risk they are willing to take.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards and their significance:&amp;#10;The ring: With this ring, the elves are calling each other for help. The player puts this card in front of him/herself and his/her turn is over.&amp;#10;The Trumptus: When all the pieces of the Trumptus have been found, the unicorns are safe. The card is placed at the center of the table, where the individual pieces form a picture of the Trumptus. The player's turn is over. If there are elven or unicorn cards in the middle of the table, the player gets to take them and put them in front of him/herself.&amp;#10;A crying unicorn: This card is particularly valuable. It stays in the middle of the table until the active player's turn is over. The player may turn over another card if he/she wants.&amp;#10;Elf with water bracelet: This card helps the player in the battle against Panthea. The card stays in the middle of the table until the active player's turn is over. The player may turn over another card if he/she wants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player who doesn't want to turn over another card may end his/her turn and take all the open elven and unicorn cards. But first he/she has to fight a duel with Panthea. With luck, he/she will be able to fight off Panthea's snake lassos. For the duel, the 6 chips are thrown into the air. Then players count how many green and blue symbols can be seen. More blue than green symbols: The player wins the duel. Equal number: If there is an elven card in the middle of the table or in front of the player, he/she can still fend off Panthea. The snake lasso and an elven card are set aside and the player wins the duel and gets to take the cards. More green than blue symbols: The player loses the duel. The open elven, unicorn and snake lasso cards are returned to the card stack, which is then shuffled again and it's the next player's turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of game: The game ends when all six Trumptus cards have been turned over. Players count the points on the cards they have collected. The player with the highest number of points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
