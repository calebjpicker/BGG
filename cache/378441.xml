						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;Kampo Therapy&amp;rdquo; is a Kampo medicine brand sold at pharmacies and drugstores. As health consciousness increases and self-medication is emphasized, we are developing brands with the desire to use Kampo medicine as a gentle companion to your precious daily life. Kampo medicines have an image of being difficult to understand, but we have devised easy-to-understand packages so that customers can pick them up according to their symptoms and concerns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Kampo Therapy&amp;quot;, which was born in 2006, will celebrate its 15th anniversary this year. In the midst of rapid changes in lifestyles and values, we plan the first card game for Kracie Yakuhin, &amp;quot;A game that makes you kind to people,&amp;quot; with the desire to create a society where everyone can live their own way.&amp;#227;&amp;#131;&amp;#187;Developed. It is a content that thinks about the &amp;quot;symptoms&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;worries&amp;quot; of the body, which have not been the subject of communication so far. In this game, the players are divided into &amp;quot;people who are unwell&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;people around them&amp;quot;, and the &amp;quot;people who are unwell&amp;quot; who are unaware of their physical condition are called by the &amp;quot;people around them&amp;quot;. This is a game that aims to become aware of your symptoms using the therapy word as a hint.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Especially for women, there are many cases where it is difficult for them to confide in their health concerns, even to close people, and they do not understand well. Depending on the group you play this game with, such as family, friends, and partners, different discoveries and new understandings may be born. We hope that by having people enjoy &amp;quot;being gentle&amp;quot;, many people will deepen their understanding of each other, and that it will be an opportunity for a &amp;quot;diversity society&amp;quot; where everyone can live in their own way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;People who are unwell&amp;quot; draw one from 45 types of &amp;quot;symptom cards&amp;quot; with various symptoms and hit it on the forehead so that it can be seen by all players other than yourself. Let the &amp;quot;people around you&amp;quot; look at the &amp;quot;symptom card&amp;quot; of the &amp;quot;unwell person&amp;quot; and apply the [therapy word] according to the method written on the &amp;quot;approach card&amp;quot; to have them notice the symptoms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Let's say kind words according to the approach card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;People around you&amp;quot; apply [therapy words] to &amp;quot;people who are unwell&amp;quot; in a method based on 9 types of approach cards. In addition to &amp;ldquo;experience/empathy,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;onomatopoeia,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;concern,&amp;rdquo; the approach cards also include &amp;ldquo;Narikiri&amp;rdquo; cards that let you pretend to be your boss, child, or lover. Let's look at. However, when using [Therapy Words], please be aware that words that include the name of the symptom cannot be used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's good to cooperate with everyone, it's good to compete, let's find your own way to play!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;People who are not feeling well&amp;quot; use the &amp;quot;therapy words&amp;quot; given by &amp;quot;people around&amp;quot; as hints, and while looking at the symptom list, answer what the &amp;quot;symptom card&amp;quot; they have is. You can only answer once. It is a success if the &amp;quot;person with poor physical condition&amp;quot; can guess their own &amp;quot;symptom card&amp;quot;. Regardless of success or failure, &amp;quot;a person who is unwell&amp;quot; will give a therapy chip to a person who thinks, &amp;quot;This person's words were kind&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;He made me notice my symptoms well.&amp;quot; increase. Repeat this while alternating the role of &amp;quot;the unwell person&amp;quot;. The game has a pattern where everyone cooperates and a pattern where you win or lose, so play with your favorite rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
