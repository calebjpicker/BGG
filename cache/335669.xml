						               													<description>The legendary people of Invicta created a Seal over the rift between the mortal realm and Demon realm, but now the Seal is breaking. In Reclaiming the Seal, you play as a descendant of Invicta and will return to the forgotten land to prevent the next Demon invasion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has up to five units to move across the hex grid map to explore the island in search of crystals, magical energy in physical form. These crystals repair the rift on the Seal in the center of the island. Players must also reactivate the Pylon towers around the island to help stabilize the magic around the Seal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the exploration, players will discover some Demons have already slipped through the rift in the Seal, and players will battle these monsters using dice combat. As players are all trying to accomplish the same goal, combat is player versus environment. Defeating Demons gives points and crystals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Invicta was once a great nation, and needs to be rebuilt. Players will spend coins building Developments around the island. Additionally, these Developments produce coins each turn, allowing players to gain more assets in their quest to prevent a Demon invasion. While repairing the Seal and slaying Demons to gain points, players will also vie for activating the Pylons. Pylons give points for each adjacent Development at the end of game, creating a dynamic decision between players trying to end the game by repairing the Seal and activating the Pylon Network for immediate points, and players building a growing community on the island for scaling points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, players move each of their Artificers and Paladins across the map and perform an action. Artificers build Developments to produce coins and Arcane Focuses that produce crystals. Paladins use crystals to repair the Seal. Both units can battle Demons, Artificers fight with a d6 while a Paladin fights with a d8. At the end of each turn, players produce coins and crystals based on the number of structures a player has built. Any time during a player's turn, they may take several other free actions including playing cards to gain new assets in their quest, enlisting more units if they have not reached their max number of units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The end of the game is triggered when a certain number of Repair actions and Activate Pylons occur. The player who scored the most points represents the descendant most fit to lead the reclaimed country.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
