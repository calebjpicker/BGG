						               													<description>Rando au pic des neiges is a team racing game with a question-and-answer session on the theme of mountain hiking.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rando au Pic des Neiges is a team-based mountain hike (except for the 2-person version) set on a game board. Players must first acquire suitable equipment and favorable weather conditions, then set off from the hamlet to reach the summit of Pic des Neiges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They advance with the help of dice, and along the way must answer numerous questions on the themes of nature, respect for the environment, knowledge of the mountain environment and, of course, safety (in the medium and high mountains). Correct answers will enable them to gain ground, but they will also have to choose their route strategically and use their yeti map skilfully.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, they'll need to respect the mountains and show team spirit if they're to win by being the first team back to the hamlet after reaching the Pic des Neiges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
