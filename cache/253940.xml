						               													<description>Pegboard Baseball is a two-player themed game based on chance and probability. It is a game of luck and skill. Background knowledge of batter statistics is advantageous. &amp;#10;The game is handmade by the designer and consists of a 6 inch round piece of wood depicting a baseball diamond with cribbage peg holes around the baselines. Players are represented by team-colored cribbage pegs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pegboard Baseball can only be played when watching a baseball game on TV or at the stadium. The main reason you need to be watching a game is because fouls count for one peg movement. The best way to tally foul balls is by watching (or listening to) a game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The score of the actual baseball game you are watching is not related to the score in Pegboard Baseball.&amp;#10; The movement of your peg depends entirely on what the batter does at the plate. Any contact between the bat and the ball is awarded by movement of your peg.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to start:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Choose two pegs that represents your team and the opposing team. Place the two pegs on home plate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The visiting team will start on the top of home plate (top of the innings) and continue around the bases on that line. The home team will start on the bottom on home plate (bottom of the innings).&amp;#10; What it looks like&amp;#10;when you are playing:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The person representing the batting team holds the pegboard.&amp;#10; Choose a goal for your game.  &amp;#10;Possibilities include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;--Follow an entire game and the player with the most points, plus furthest distance, wins.&amp;#10;--Play for an equal number of innings and see whose peg traveled furthest (points plus distance). For example, prior to starting announce, &amp;ldquo;We are going to play for three innings.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Peg movement depend on&amp;#10;what each batter does at the plate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Foul Ball = 1 peg movement&amp;#10;When the batter hits the ball foul, out of play, that equals 1 peg movement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inplay Out = 2 peg movements&amp;#10;When a batter hits the ball in fair territory, but the batter is out. This includes pop flies and ground outs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Single = 3 peg movements&amp;#10;When a batter hits the ball and is safe at 1st base.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Double = 4 peg movements&amp;#10;When the batter hits the ball and is safe at 2nd base. Also, ground rule doubles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Triple = 5 peg movements&amp;#10;When the batter hits the ball and is safe at 3rd base.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Home run = 6&amp;#10;Two run homer = 12&amp;#10;Three run homer = 18&amp;#10;Grand Slam = 24&amp;#10; Bunt foul = 2&amp;#10;Bunt infield but out = 4&amp;#10;Bunt single = 6&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Optional Scoring&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Optional scoring prior to play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For more peg movement: see directions&amp;#10;For less peg movements: see directions&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Optional scoring during play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prior to any at-bat (or inning), a player can wager for more or less peg movements based on a hopeful outcome. Experienced fans may know when good players are coming up to bat and decide to risk their peg's movement.&amp;#10;Players are encouraged to be creative in their wagers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
