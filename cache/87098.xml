						               													<description>Paraphrased from the game's instruction sheet:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A word game for two to four players, utilizing a deck of 112 cards with individual letters on them (4 of each constanant other than Z (of which there are 2) and 6 each of A,E,I,O and U).  Players are dealt a hand of 9 cards. Game play consists of laying cards to form complete words, which are scored against a table. &amp;#10;A player's turn begins by drawing a card from either the draw pile or the top of the discard pile, then continues with the laying of whatever words the player can make with the cards in his or her hand, then finishes with the laying of an additional card to the discard pile.  Players may also capture words made by other players by adding letters to the played word to form a new word.&amp;#10;A round ends when someone fully discards his hand by playing a word or words.  The player does not need to be able to discard a card if playing all cards into words.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A later version of this game was published together with the dice game Farkel; that game has a deck half the size.</description>
