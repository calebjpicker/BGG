						               													<description>The object of the game is to either accumulate $1 million in winnings or match all six &amp;quot;Big Deal Lotto&amp;quot; numbers on their card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes one score card that has three lottery games on it: Triple Play, 4-Play and Big Deal Lotto. They are then given $40,000 to start play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Through rolling a die and moving around the board, players can play various lottery games in an effort to accumulate the $1 million goal, or earn or lose money on event spaces (i.e. - Auto Accident, Pay College Tuition, Inheritance, etc.). On each of those spaces, the amount won or lost is determined by the number they roll after landing on the space. If a player cannot afford to pay a penalty, they can either pay what they have or pay nothing and miss their next turn, but no player is ever eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Triple Play, a player pays $400 to the bank and chooses one of the Triple Play number sets on their card and roll three dice up to three times trying to match those numbers. If successful, their winnings are based on how many turns it took out of the three to match the numbers. If they are unsuccessful, they win nothing and their turn is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4-Play is the same as Triple Play, but with higher payouts, and the player rolls four dice up to four times. They also pay $500 to play it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Big Deal Lotto requires a $1,000 payment, and the player rolls one die. If the roll matches a number on their card, they cover it with a chip and and are on step closer to winning.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players may also join in on another player's lottery by being the first to shout &amp;quot;Big Money&amp;quot;, but risk paying that player if they are unsuccessful in the lottery being played. There is also an &amp;quot;Investment&amp;quot; space where players can put up between $1,000 and $10,000 in an effort to multiply their winnings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a longer game, winning requires a player to both acquire at least $1 million, as well as match all six of their Big Deal Lotto numbers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
