						               													<description>You are the leader of a band of mercenaries funded by an employer to take control of a location and rid it of your employer's enemies.Your home is dud of a safe haven planet to which your ancestors fled from an unwinnable war. Turns out the planet's wildlife is more of a threat than the war was. Now most people are doing what they can to survive, while those few that thrive aim to mold this new world as they see fit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players spend currency called Clips, which is provided by controlled bases, to hire differing levels of troopers, based on the amount spent to hire, and summon them to Base Spaces they control on a hexagon girded map consisting of various different terrain types.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players selectively draw cards from a personal deck into their hand. Players spend Clips to purchase Tier Cards and summon them from their hand of cards to a base they control. There are three tire types, Blue Tier, Green Tier, and Red Tier, each with different types of corresponding weapons and armor cards. Tire color types and sub-types determine the effectiveness of different types of weapons vs. different types of armor and vice versa. The more Tier cards of a color the player has attached to bases they control the better the items, of the matching color, they can equip from their hand to troopers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once players have troopers on the map they then spend movement points to maneuver their troopers around the map in an effort to defeat their opponents by utilizing terrain spaces which conceal troopers to keep their tier investments a secret, eliminating enemy troopers in combat, capturing neutral/enemy bases, stealing enemy tech, exploring dangerous ruins for lost technology that could aid their efforts, and visiting settlements which will challenge their wits and offer beneficial trading options.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is initiated when a trooper attacks a target that is within range of their equipped weapon at which point an eight sided die is rolled. If the number rolled plus the level of the attacking trooper is greater than the level of the target plus any modifiers, then the attack hits and damage is calculated based on weapon and armor types and sub-types.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
