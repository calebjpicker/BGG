						               													<description>For its age, some quite clever ideas. Here are the important rules;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is intended for two players, one taking the 'planes' and the other the 'shells', both represented by discs.&amp;#10;The aim of the game is to get as many planes as possible through to the Objective. Each player moves in turn commencing with a Plane.&amp;#10;The Moves;&amp;#10;The discs move according to the number obtained by spinning the arrow. The exact number of places must be moved each time and only one disc for each move. Planes must be moved forward (never backward).&amp;#10;The red-circle shells move horizontal (sic) left or right only. The black-circle shell may move horizontal (left or right) or vertically (backwards or forwards) but not outside the green half of the board.&amp;#10;Shells can move only if the number of spaces to be moved brings the shell to a circle of the same colour as a plane in play.&amp;#10;Rules;&amp;#10;The planes' player moves any plane he chooses. He may try to reach his objective with one at a time or more if he so desires, but he must not forego a move if it is possible to move a plane the required space.&amp;#10;Shells may pass over planes but not over another shell.&amp;#10;Planes may pass over another plane or shell.&amp;#10;Losses;&amp;#10;A plane is hit (and thus out of the game) if it comes to a circle occupied by a shell or if a shell hits the plane. That is, if a shell is able to move to a circle occupied by a plane. A hit is also registered if a plane comes to one of the red circles in the yellow half of the board, provided the red line is connected with a circle of the same colour as the plane and this circle has a shell on it or a shell hits it before the plane moves on.&amp;#10;Now place the discs on the circles as marked taking care to put the black-circle shell on its appropriate circle.&amp;#10;If the arrow should stop dead on a dividing line, spin it again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These rules make a little more sense when you look at the images. Note that it is never properly explained who wins. Does the planes' player win if he gets just one plane to the objective? Or more? I guess you need to make some 'house rules' before playing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
