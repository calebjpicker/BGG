						               													<description>Short Description:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battles for the crown will last for at least 10 rounds of non-stop action! With each round comprising a varying number of cards, the game is kept dynamic and engaging. Players must strategically place their bets on the number of tricks they believe they can win in each round. However, beware of bidding incorrectly as you risk losing valuable points. The game adds an exciting twist as players have the option to bid on two different numbers, and if they successfully achieve at least one, they earn half of the points they were supposed to earn if they bided one. The ultimate victor is the player who accumulates the highest number of points throughout the game. &amp;#10;Are you ready to claim the crown?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Long Description:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rounds:&amp;#10;In each round, the number of cards dealt to each player changes. &amp;#10;The first round begins with one card per player, the second round has two cards per player, and so on, until the final round where each player receives a number of cards equal to the round number.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To prepare for the game, you need to choose the cards you want to use in the deck. The number of cards you need for the game will vary based on the number of players involved.&amp;#10;You can experience unique gameplay by only changing the Special Cards or altering the rounds structure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set up:&amp;#10;To begin, randomly pick a dealer for the first round. On each subsequent round, the dealer should change in a clockwise direction. The dealer will always have the spinner specifying the number of cards dealt in that round.&amp;#10;The dealer shuffles the deck and deals a hand of cards to each player. In each round, the number of cards dealt is different.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trump suit &amp;amp; alliance card:&amp;#10;On each round, the dealer shuffles the deck of Trump suits and reveals one card. This card determines the trump suit/color for the current round. If the card revealed is an X, no Trump suit will be used for that round. If the card revealed is the flag with 4 colors, the dealer chooses which suit/color will serve as the trump suit for that round.&amp;#10;If the card revealed is an alliance card, you need to form teams of two. The dealer will decide the direction of team formations; to either his/her left or right. But, if there is an odd number of players, some players will be left without a partner. In this case, the dealer will choose who will be left without a partner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bidding phase: &amp;#10;Each player declares how many tricks they think they can win in the current round. Bidding starts with the player on the left of the dealer and continues in a clockwise direction. The bid can be any number between 0 and the total number of cards dealt in that round. Ensure that every player gets the corresponding bidding token reflecting their bid amount.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play:&amp;#10;The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick of the round by playing a card from their hand. The other players then have to play a card of the same suit/color, if possible. If they don't have any cards of the same suit, they can play a card from another suit. If a trump suit card is played, it's stronger than the leading suit, otherwise, all other suits are weaker.&amp;#10;The Player who won the trick leads the suit/color of the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game End:&amp;#10;After all the tricks have been played, the players count up the number of tricks they have won and compare it to their bid. Points are awarded for each trick won and players who do not meet their bid lose points.&amp;#10;At the end of each round, the player with the highest score gets the crown to indicate the current leader. In case of a tie between players, place the crown at the center between them.&amp;#10;The player with the highest score at the end of the final round will be crowned the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, stop reading and go claim that crown!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
