						               													<description>Site of Soldiers is a collectible card game where two players with 30 card decks play against each other until one player fully encroaches on the other. A player can encroach by attacking when the opponent does not have a Warrior card in their main row or by defeating an opponents Warrior or Monarch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The mechanics of this game rhyme the mechanics of chess. Each character type is a play on a chess piece (except the king). Monarchs, a play on the Queen, can Strike any face up character, causing direct damage to their health. Scouts, the Pawns of this game, can Stab any adjacent face up card on the opponents field causing direct damage to their health. Bastions, Clerics, and Huntsman Warriors can attack and exchange blows with other Warriors. These characters get attack advantages when attacking in their respective advantage positions. A Warriors damage to another warrior is the difference between their attack stat and the opponents warriors defense stat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Encroaching is maintained by tokens. Each player has four token slots. Each slot can be filled with a Move Token or Death Token, where Death Tokens are always ordered first. The first to Four Death Tokens wins. These tokens are utilized to increase the number of attacks a players Warrior can do per Exchanging of Blows and to pay for character skills.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What makes this game stand out from the rest is each card will have randomized stats, a player can only play stronger cards after their opponent has encroached far enough, Warriors have attack advantages that can disrupt the field, the player can move cards around the board to get into better positions, and the speed of a warrior can be utilized to evade attacks causing the opponent to encroach, allowing the opponent to do more damage, but allowing the evading player to play stronger cards. All of these combined make for a strategic but simple game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
