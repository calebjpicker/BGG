						               													<description>The description for Boggle reads: &amp;quot;Can you find words no one else can see in the letter grid?&amp;quot;  As in Boggle, players race to build words using dice imprinted with letters, but unlike Boggle, it's okay if everyone finds the same words!  Instead of knocking out your opponents finds with your own, in Letter Scrambler, players individually score the words they find, based on the printed scoring table in the rules, which awards points according to the length of the words they have written down.  Over the course of several rounds, players build up their scores (to a predetermined number), and best of all: there is no timer ticking away at you while you try to think!  Letter Scrambler is also unique from Boggle in that it uses a clever mechanism (the namesake scrambler) to both house &amp;amp; roll the 7 letter dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roll the mixer on your hand and place on a table.&amp;#10;Race against others to form words using the letters showing.&amp;#10;The longer the words, the more points you score.&amp;#10;You never lose the dice with the handy Magic Mixer,&amp;#10;which fits in your pocket for on-the-go fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
