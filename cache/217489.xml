Incredible safety deployment, protection systems have been carefully designed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Among all the pieces featured are five valuable jewels coveted by the world's most famous thieves, who will meet there in an attempt to prove who is the best of them all. They will all try to steal them without being trapped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No one can enter without jumping the system. No one? ... Nothing can be removed from the museum without being detected. Nothing?...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Penetrate into the Palace of the Alhambra, getting as many jewels as possible and escaping without being discovered is the challenge of the game. Each player becomes a thief for the duration of the game, and must use all his ingenuity to avoid escape the strict security measures that have been put in place to protect the jewels. All the tools and weapons necessary to carry out the stole have been buried in the Palace Gardens: the Arrayanes's Garden and the Lion's Garden, months before the Opening of the Exhibition, and so during the first tour for these two gardens, simulated to be innocent visitors, the players are collecting the necessary equipment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The only escape route is through the Mosque located in the northwest corner of the Palace, as the Alhambra is surrounded by walls around its perimeter. There are a powerful off-road vehicle that will take the triumphant thief down the mountain with the precious booty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you get it, you will have won and the first pages of the international press will open their editions with &amp;quot;Scandal!
