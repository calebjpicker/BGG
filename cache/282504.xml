						               													<description>Dugout Steps Baseball is a full simulation of the game of Baseball that features a highly detailed interaction between Pitchers and Batters, giving flavor to the age-old battle between Hurler and Slugger. Dugout Steps Baseball provides for a wide variety in Pitcher Performance which, in turn, makes each game unique and detailed. Once a ball is put into play, the action really heats up in Dugout Steps Baseball. Ballparks and Fielders are easily incorporated into game play and you will certainly know the difference between playing at Wrigley Field and Dodger Stadium. Great Fielders who flash the leather really make a difference in Dugout Steps Baseball as they bail out Pitchers with great defensive plays. Big Bat and No Leather players will provide pop at the plate, but fizzle in the field. Drama surrounds Big Flys that can either get out or fall short of the wall. Fielders can pick 'em off the top of the fence and wind can blow a Big Fly foul. When men are on base, Strategy becomes involved and adds fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dugout Steps Baseball features a highly sophisticated system for knowing the location of a batted ball without having to do anything more than simply look at a number. This one number, however, opens up a world of possibility in Fielding and Baserunning. Baserunner Advancement features Collisions and Close Plays where the Baserunner attempts to avoid a tag or the Fielder tries to slap the tag on the Baserunner. Blown Calls add drama and fun and trigger Manager Arguments. Plays involving the Pivot are handled easily, but with great detail, as Middle Infielders try to Turn Two or a Baserunner attempts to break up a Twin Killing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dugout Steps Baseball includes the option to be played at a Basic Level and even contains an optional Add-On for determining Pitch Counts easily and seamlessly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
