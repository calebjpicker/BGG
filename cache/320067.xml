						               													<description>Trepidation is a cooperative horror survival game, where players are trying trying to make it to the end of the forest. All players are given a role card at the beginning of the game, which is broken down by the townspeople and the possessed role. Townspeople are trying to make it to the end of the forest, while the possessed player is trying to have everyone killed before they reach the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are monsters and events standing in between you and your escape. Your survival will depend upon collecting and trading items, strategizing, and figuring out whom to trust in your party. Can you make it out of the forest alive?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every player is dealt a limited number of location and item cards. The location cards are used throughout the game to progress through the forest. Each location card will indicate whether you will draw an item, event, or monster card for that turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are unique location cards found within the deck called landmarks. The landmarks are what you will be searching for and must complete as a group to continue your progress through the forest. Depending on the difficulty you select at the beginning of the game, you will have to complete either 3, 5 or 7 landmarks to make it out of the forest. Planning ahead is a necessity, as the landmarks will force the entire party to combat monsters the moment they are played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every monster has a unique way that it must be warded off. Some monsters are more problematic, and even more perilous to come across than others. Use your items and plan ahead in order to overcome that which awaits you and your team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Be careful, though, as the possessed player may try to deceive you. They can use the event, item and landmark cards to their advantage, and will try blending in as a normal towns person throughout the game... waiting until your guard is down before sabotaging you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
