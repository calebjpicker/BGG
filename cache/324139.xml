						               													<description>Description from Washington Post, January 21, 1982:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;My mother's sister is my aunt--20 points; my autn's neice is me--30 points; but then again, she could be my sister or my cousin, and my grandmother's cousin is my . . . what?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Weaving through the genealogy of who begat whom on the family tree has become a new card game called &amp;quot;Family Treedition,&amp;quot; created by Mildred Davidson Austin Smith, an active community volunteer and former opera singer from Northwest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Smith said she designed the game as a &amp;quot;way to get back in touch with the family,&amp;quot; and as an inexpensive form of family entertainment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the genealogy game is to earn points by placing on a board three cards from your hand that represent a correct relationship between blood relatives. For example, &amp;quot;my father's first cousin is my second cousin.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck's 64 cards represent everyone from great-grandmother to third cousin. Of course, there are a few wild cards, to get you out of tight spots. The figures on the cards have what Smith calls Egyptian-like, angular features. These, she said, are universal faces.&amp;#10;Smith said she started working on the game in 1975, &amp;quot;even before Roots came on television.&amp;quot; It seemed simple, she said, until she realized there are hundreds of possible combinations of relatives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Smith obtained a patent on &amp;quot;Family Treedition&amp;quot; two years ago. She paid a printer to produce 100 copies of the game last October and has sold them all, many as Christmas gifts. Another 500 copies are on the way for $14.95 each. The game can be purchased from Smith, or through Stanley 5 &amp;amp; 10 Cent Stores in Brookland.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
