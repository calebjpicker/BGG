						               													<description>The designer writes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Dilemma is a two player strategy game that is easy to learn and its fast-paced action creates extreme adrenaline pumping excitement. Dilemma has been designed to be played at a swift pace which calls for instant decision making, when players are faced with the Dilemma of attacking their opponents advancement or running for Home Base.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dilemma is unique, a completely new concept unlike any other board game. From strategies taken from the worlds leading board games, chess and backgammon, comes 13 years of development to create the fast-paced, quick thinking, adrenaline pumping board game Dilemma.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In reality this is a dice rolling game seemingly targeted at children (Ages 7 and up). Two players have three kinds of pieces on an abstract board: Attackers, Beacons and Guardians. The Attackers are numbered 1 to 5 and each turn a die is rolled - the Attacker with that number may move. The Attackers take two steps each to surround a Beacon, which, when surrounded by three Attackers is destroyed and one of the Attackers teleports to another board to attack the opponents Guardian. You win by either surrounding the opponents Guardian by three Attackers in this manner of moving your Guardian to Home Base. The Guardian can move whenever you roll a 6. Alternately on a roll of 6 you may remove one your opponents Attackers from around one of your Beacons. On 6 you can advance or defend - this is apparently the dilemma.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this manner you roll dice, move, roll, dice, move until someone wins. The strategy content is literally zero and there seems a reasonable chance the game won't end at all (as it is less likely to roll the numbers needed to advance than to hinder your opponent).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pieces are elegantly cast out of soft plastic and the board is attractive in a spacey abstract kind of way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was published on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, and was probably never widely circulated in spite of the designers claim:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Social Championships and World Championships are to be played using the same rules. The rules are: You must declare you are playing for the championship title. The best player over three games only is the champion. If you lose to the champion you cannot challenge again for twelve months, The only way you can challenge before that time is if the champ loses the title to another challenger, you may then challenge that champion. It is advisable not to play for the championship title until you are confident that you have played enough games to learn all strategies involved in winning the game. The longest title held by a champion (as at December 1994) is 23 challenges over 1 year.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
