						               													<description>Prepare for an intense war in this epic area control game! In the Grime survival is everything, four distinct factions are vying for control of the Grime - and you'll need to be cunning, strategic, and merciless to outmaneuver your opponents and eliminate the vicious Claw organization, who are determined to destroy every last instinct well in the land or gain enough victory points to shut down the AI driven claw by finding the main computer system and shutting them down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With the help of an array of powerful Goon characters, you'll perform special actions that give you a crucial edge over your rivals. But the real key to victory lies in balancing your resources and generating the five different types of instincts that fuel your war machine. Take over districts, construct mighty war engines like tanks, airships, zeppelins, and cannons, and defend your territory against relentless Claw invasions. Choose special orders to gain an edge, and gather instincts as you conquer the corresponding districts that generate them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But make no mistake - the Claw is not to be trifled with! With their formidable tank defenses, airship assaults, and cunning invasions that grow ever more challenging over time, they'll stop at nothing to achieve their nefarious goals. And if they run out of tokens or penetrate another player's stronghold, the game is over for everyone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
