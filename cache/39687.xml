						               													<description>Fans of Chess and Arimaa will want to pay close attention to The Travelers, a game which has not been commercially produced, but probably should be.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game, played on a 9&amp;times;9 board, is explained as &amp;quot;an unorthodox game, very different from Western Chess. It is a strange game, but it is very nice, and regardless the apparent simplicity of some pieces and rules, it is a very complex and deep game. The object of the game is to move TWO pieces, called TRAVELERS, to the last rank,&amp;quot; according to information found on www.chessvariants.org.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pieces include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Travelers (T): Can move in the eight directions, up-to three positions. A Traveler can't capture pieces, neither being captured. A Traveler can't  move into Check, but if in Check, it is not obligatory that you move your Traveler. When a Traveler reaches the last rank, it can't move, neither being displaced. You win the game if your two Travelers reach the last rank.&amp;#10;     Displacer (D): Can move as Queens. If a Displacer lands on a square orthogonally adjacent to an enemy piece, you can DISPLACE the enemy piece (except a Block) and send it to ANY EMPTY square in the vertical line or the horizontal line defined by the Displacer's landing square. A Displacer can't displace a Traveler that has reached the last rank.&amp;#10;     Block (B): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Block can't capture, neither being captured. Block can't be displaced. A Block can't never move to the first or to the last rank.&amp;#10;     Ace (1): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. An Ace can capture a piece at distance 1 in the eight directions, except a Traveler or a Block.&amp;#10;     Deuce (2): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Deuce can capture a piece at distance exactly 2 in the eight directions, regardless there is or not an intermediate piece in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks.&amp;#10;     Trey (3): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Trey can capture a piece at distance exactly 3 in the eight directions, regardless there are or not intermediate pieces in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You start the games with two Travelers, one Displacer, one Block, four Aces, two Deuces and two treys.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
