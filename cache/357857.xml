						               													<description>For many centuries there was peace in the four great kingdoms and life in the lands was simple and carefree. One day, however, unfriendly and warlike tribes appeared from the lands beyond the horizon and brought danger to the four kingdoms. The four rulers decided together to protect the people from the evil invaders and bring them into the cities. However, because the cities were too small and unsafe, they were first to be enlarged and expanded. Defensive towers, churches and a city wall were to be built around the stately palace, which was also to be newly erected. And so the great builders of the world were commissioned to plan and implement the buildings for the kingdom of the mountain lands in the north, the kingdom of the sun in the east, the desert kingdom in the south and the kingdom of the forest peoples in the west. In order to get all this done in time before a possible attack by the enemy tribes, the builders gather people from all walks of life - from peasants to princes - to help and cooperate from the lands. Each person is given his or her task, which must be completed exactly according to plan and order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You and your fellow players slip into the role of these master builders. Everyone tries to place all their cards with the helping citizens on the building sites before all the other players. Act wisely and strategically as a master builder and you may become the greatest master builder of the four kingdoms...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
