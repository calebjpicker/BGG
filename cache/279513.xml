						               													<description>IT TAKES A MONSTER TO CREATE ONE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Monster Mutation is a very simple game to learn and can be played by 2 to 4 players. The age mark is 5 years of age, but even more feeble minded creatures will be able to simply have a lot of fun creating their own unique &amp;#10;and gross mutations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GOAL &amp;#10;The goal of Monster Mutation is to earn points by assembling &amp;#10;disgusting monsters. When the game ends, you will be awarded points for monsters with most eyeballs, most fins, longest monster, largets monster ect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CARDS &amp;#10;There are three types of cards:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Missions: There is a total of 10 mission cards that each layer are fighting over during the game. The mission cards decribe what type of monster combinations might give you points at the end of the game. Each mission card has its specific requirements on how to obtain its one point value. There is a total of 10 different missions. See details on the back of each mission card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MONSTER PARTS&amp;#10;There are various monster part cards:&amp;#10;A. Red/weapons Allows a mutation to eat meat.&amp;#10;B. Green/mouths allow a mutation to eat plants.&amp;#10;C. Blue/Finns allow a mutations to swim.&amp;#10;D. Purple/Legs allow a mutation to run.&amp;#10;E. Yellow/Eyes allow a creature to see better.&amp;#10;F. Connecters have multible open endings and allow you to build        larger creatures.(Size matters).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Hourglass: This card can be used to define when the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SET UP THE GAME&amp;#10;All monster part cards are placed in a single pile in the middle of the table, it is referred to as the monster part pile. The mission cards are all placed face up, next to each other so the possible missions can be seen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;START THE GAME&amp;#10;Place the hourglass card face down some where in the lower half of the monster part pile. The more players you play the further down in the pile you should place it. You can also choose to exclude the hourglass card, and simply play until the monster card pile is empty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;EACH TURN&amp;#10;1. Draw 2 cards from the monster card pile.&amp;#10;2. Place the monster cards face up on the table in front of you.&amp;#10;3. You may connect monster parts that fits together (as shown below).&amp;#10;Note that you may only have a maximum of three unfinished monsters at the same time. Once a card has been put together with another, they are locked in place and may not be separated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FITS TOGETHER In order for two monster parts to fit together, their open endings must have the same size. Thin part endings cannot be connected to thick part endings, vice versa.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;UNFINISHED MONSTER A unfinished monster is one who has one or more open endings. A single part also counts as a unfinished monster.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME ENDS The game ends when the hourglass card has been drawn. &amp;#10;All unfinished creatures instantly dies, and are put away. &amp;#10;As they may not be included in the final score.&amp;#10;WINNER The winner of the game is the one who earns the most mission cards. If two or more players has reached the same amount of a spescific mission card requirements the point goes to no one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Are YOU a MONSTER?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
