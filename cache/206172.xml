						               													<description> description from designer:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It was a fine evening as I was sitting comfortably in my chair sipping Mrs. Hudson's remarkable tea. Holmes was walking heavily around the room, complaining quite arrogantly about the lack of crime in this world. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;Have you thought of my Christmas gift yet?' I asked him politely, interrupting his rather disturbing topic. 'No' he said as he looked down the window. 'But it looks like i'm getting mine early this year.' Few moments later we heard a knock on our door. 'If i don't open, will turn back and come later?' he asked. 'Certainly not, considering the situation i am in.' said a voice from outside. 'Good' said Holmes, 'Then do come in, it's open.&amp;#10;&amp;#10; Lestrade walked in with a look of quite serious anxiety on his face.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;221B is a paragraph card game, where you control the duo of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson to solve interesting cases in Victorian London. In this game, you may travel to different locations and deduce information from different suspects, the way they talk, the way they dress. Conduct experiments on important pieces of evidences, research crucial information and solve the case before time runs out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inspired from games like Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective and T.I.M.E Stories, the game consists of a base game deck of basic locations. I will upload with that several case decks where each case will have story cards and other cards to mix with the base deck. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson will have different actions like travelling, interrogating, examining they can do each turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Within a few turns the game will end. You can check your theory and accuse suspects. If you are right you win. But if wrong, you can chose to play the case again. Each game plays in roughly around 40 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
