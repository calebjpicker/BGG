						               													<description>VludKin ClaNz is a card game for two players about the struggle of the VludKin for control over the Vlud, the energy upon which their world is built. Each player starts with two VludKin cards from different ClaNz, and their goal is to not have the lowest influence VludKin when the game ends, and therefore be the player controlling the Vlud.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is an original &amp;quot;stack-building&amp;quot; card game for two players, with a set of rules that are quick and simple to learn, but offering numerous strategic options and dirty tricks on the path to victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player receives two random VludKin cards from different ClaNz, and during the game they draw a card from the central deck which they then try to win with one of their VludKin, rolling over that VludKin's Influence modified by the card. If this card is an Influence card, they can then place it under one of the VludKin, altering their Influence value based on the Clan type shown on the card. If it's a Power card, then they can carry out the special action on that card before it is discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Failing to win a card will earn the VludKin a -1 Influence token to their total, and they can get rid of these only through trading an Influence card matching their Clan or the use of certain power cards, which might actually move all the tokens to an enemy instead. If an Influence card is failed, then the other player gets a chance to win it. If a Power card is failed, then the power is automatically played by the enemy VludKin opposite; sometimes it's in your advantage to fail a Power card...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, the stacks of cards under each VludKin are built, changing their Influence up and down over turns until the game ends and the player with the lowest VludKin loses. With the ability to play Influence cards on the other player's VludKin and with the use of Power cards to move Influence cards around the stacks, a level of strategy is added to the simple core rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when either a VludKin reaches ten Influence or the central deck is empty, so through the use of Influence and Power cards a tense game builds in which the balance of Influence can change right up to the end on the asymmetrical board game playfield. There is little down time for the players and no hidden hands of cards, so this provides an exciting head-to-head experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;VludKin ClaNz comes with eight VludKin from four ClaNz, two copies of each of the twelve different power cards, and forty Influence cards. Adding extra sets of the Power and Influence cards gives you the option to customize the central deck to how you want to play, and also gives the option for a longer game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you gain influence over the VludKin in this original card game?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
