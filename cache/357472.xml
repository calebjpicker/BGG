						               													<description>The game is called Iwok&amp;aacute;: La Tierra sin Mal (The land without evil). It is played on the space of a board, between two players: one will be the Tupi-Guarani aboriginal people, and the other the viceroy with his army. But, while the game is played, the competitors -due to the characteristics of entertainment- will be invited to walk the path of historical knowledge; they will be able to know the circumstances of the time; the rituals, legends and cosmogonies of the aborigines; They will be able to delve into the war iconography of the time, the weapons and ships of the conquerors, their war tactics, etc. And, also, some continental geography.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two players or teams can play the Iwok&amp;aacute; from the age of 9. One will be the Tupi-Guarani people, and the other will be the viceroy and his army. It is played with green and brown chips, in circular movements. On the board the most important place is the center called Arete (the promised land of the aboriginal people). The viceroy is occupying this sacred place: his objective will be to leave through four paths or exit points, from the center to the outside of the board, and flee by ship with the stolen riches. In the escape, he will be protected by his army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Tupi-Guarani, who are around the Arete, have the mission of preventing the viceroy and his army from escaping with his riches. How do they prevent the flight of the conquerors? Enclosing them with tokens. The army can be &amp;quot;eaten&amp;quot; with the tokens and eliminated, but the viceroy must be locked up with the tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The invaders win if the viceroy reaches any of the four starting squares, and flee with the riches. The natives win if the viceroy is trapped between tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
