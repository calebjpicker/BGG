						               													<description>A game in which everyone is jockeying for the top spot in the competitive world of book publishing!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Book Jockeys, the goal is to present the most appealing book proposal to the publisher (aka, judge), in hopes that he or she will select your book proposal as the book &amp;ldquo;Most likely to...(fill in the blank).&amp;rdquo; In some cases, you&amp;rsquo;ll be aiming high (i.e., for the most appealing book), and in others, you&amp;rsquo;ll be aiming low (i.e., for the least appealing). Each author (aka, jockey) will use a combination of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and numbers to create their book proposal before taking turns pitching their proposed title (&amp;amp; accompanying plot). The author/jockey who earns the most successful pitches wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
