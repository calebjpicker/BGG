						               													<description>A fun collection of strategy games in a practical format, for many one-on-one challenges, wherever you want and with whoever you want.  Are you ready? Choose the game, take the marker and think about the right move!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pack contains 7 boards on which the boards of the following classic abstract games are shown: GOMOKU - NIM - DOTS &amp;amp; BOXES - SNAKES - MAMMA VS PAPPA - CHINESE WALL.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GOMOKU It is an ancient strategy game also called &amp;quot;five in a row&amp;quot;. The players take turns marking a square with their symbol (eg &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;). The first player to get five of their own symbols aligned, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;NIM It is an ancient game of unknown origins. The players take turns erasing one or more cans from a single row.  They must remove at least one jar and can remove any number of cans from the same row.  The last player able to move wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DOTS &amp;amp; BOXES It is a &amp;quot;pencil and paper&amp;quot; game with countless variations. How to play The two players take turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines between two adjacent points.  If a player completes the fourth side of a square, he marks that square with the initial of his name (or a letter of recognition) and must immediately draw another line (as if it were an extra turn).  When all squares have been filled, the player who has captured the most squares is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SNAKES It is the &amp;quot;pen and paper&amp;quot; version of an old video game.  How to play It is played on a 7 x 7 point matrix.  The first player starts from the green &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; point in the upper left, while the other starts with the red &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; point in the lower right, as shown in the image.  Players take turns growing their snake, extending it one segment at a time by drawing a horizontal or vertical line from the previous point to an adjacent one.  The first player unable to move loses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MOM VS PAPPA It is a &amp;quot;pen and paper&amp;quot; strategy game: the aim is to recreate the word MOM for one player and the word PAPPA on the grid for the other. At the beginning of the game, the players decide who plays for PAPPA (inserting the letters P and A) and who for MOMMA (inserting the letters Me A).  On his turn, the player inserts one of the two letters of his word in any box, without having to use the same letter every turn.  The player who is the first to spell his word horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CHINESE WALL is a simple and fun game.  The aim is to be the last player to create a wall that spans three territories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
