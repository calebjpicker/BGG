						               													<description>King Henry VIII&amp;rsquo;s trip to India cannot successfully conclude until he gets a taste of the best Indian food the King of India has to offer. The Indian King has commissioned some of the finest chefs to compete for a chance to cook at Henry&amp;rsquo;s Feast. He has asked his Head Chef to arrange the competition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Henry's Feast is a competitive, family friendly, appetizing, cooking board game for the hungry. A balanced but deep strategy game where players are constantly challenged to think ahead and work with limited resources to cook King Henry's favorite dishes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of a personal kitchen in the form of player board that each player will use to cook their dishes. The kitchen also has a pantry with a limited space and can only store so many ingredients. Players are forced to choose between using their stations to start cooking, and therefore, revealing the dishes they want to cook or store them in the pantry for future use. However, the empty space in the pantry will determine how many ingredients you can take in the next round. In the middle of all the players, lies the Stockroom that is quicker to get to, but has a lower probability of finding the ingredients you need. The Market has all the ingredients but is farther and requires more time (an extra round) to utilize.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Recipes (50 of them) tell you all the ingredients you need to cook various types of dishes. They can be Easy, Medium or Hard to cook, and also lets you know the course of the dish. The recipes for the Feast create a race to the finish line and determines who ends the game first. But the Chef's Corner will provide you with those extra recipes that will let you get ahead of the competition and win it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Not that fast! Winning doesn't come easy and the multitude of strategies come from the Chef's Bonus. Stations, Satchels, Hand Limit and Pantry all give you an extra edge throughout out the game. At higher bonus levels that edge becomes larger but getting the bonuses isn't an easy feat. You will have to choose between when to go for the victory points or when to get the bonuses. They all use the same resources, and maintaining that balance while controlling your heartbeat as someone visits Chef's Corner to steal the recipe you have been working so hard to cook is where Henry's Feast will test your limits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a players turn they will perform one action to take the available ingredients or steal recipes. Using these the player will Cook dishes which will earn them victory points or bonuses. Victory points may also be earned from making combos of dishes or making the most number of dishes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player cooks all the feast recipes and announces Last Call. This sets up the last round. After the last round is done victory points are counted and the player with the most victory points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
