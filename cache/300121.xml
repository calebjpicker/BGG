						               													<description>FIRETEAM: Tactics (FTT for short) is a tactical tabletop war game designed for small-scale battles with plastic brick models and figures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action takes place in the near future where aliens are invading Planet Earth - or, as a matter of fact, anywhere you want it to, as long as there are battles involved. &amp;#10;Gameplay is mission-based and allows advancement for any surviving characters, adding RPG-elements into the mix. &amp;#10;There is no requirement for measuring tapes or rulers. Most dice rolls in FTT are made with twelve-sided dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Except for the hexagon-patterned surface of the battlefield itself, which you can have printed on vinyl, canvas, or any other suitable material at your local printer, everything on the table is represented through plastic bricks and compatible figures. Units as well as obstacles and terrain pieces will look amazing, given you are a skilled enough builder and have some Lego or other brick building toys at your disposal. As one might easily figure out, there's a significant advantage over using traditional glued and painted miniatures in a game like this: When something falls and breaks (you know it WILL), there's no reason to suffer a nervous breakdown over the amount of elaborate work that went into it. Instead, putting things back together will take just a couple of seconds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just like the building brick toys that inspired me, FTT is a modular system designed with expandability in mind. This means the core document will provide you with mostly basic rules, but other content, such as units, weapons, and missions, is kept separate, making it easier to customize the game and add more content. While you will quickly realize how accessible the creation of your own material is, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t be able to resist providing you with extra content in the long run, as well. Expect more settings, scenarios, game modes, units, weapons, powers, and rule expansions from me in the future, as my building brick collection grows and evolves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Download your core rules PDF for free. I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to make any money off this project, and I will do my best to keep fine-tuning and updating the rules and other downloadable files according to any feedback I receive.&amp;#10;In addition to the core rules, you will need the following to play the game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     DIY printables: battle mat, stickers, unit cards, and weapon cards &amp;ndash; included with your download&amp;#10;     Unit spreadsheet: Required for creating custom units by yourself &amp;ndash; included with your download&amp;#10;     Dice: 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, 20-sided, at least one of each&amp;#10;     And last but not least, fitting plastic brick building toys to make the game pieces and matching figures. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For the standard flavour the core rules where designed in mind with, I recommend using contemporary or futuristic-looking soldiers, aliens and robots &amp;ndash; figures best found in various Lego sci-fi themes, such as &amp;ldquo;Alpha Team&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Exo Force&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Space Police&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Alien Conquest&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Galaxy Squad&amp;rdquo;. Weapons and gear from third-party manufacturers such as Brickarms or Brickforge work like a charm on these.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For best results, customizing figures by mixing and matching their components is key. Obstacles and other terrain pieces are simply built from bricks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer / publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
