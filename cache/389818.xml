						               													<description>Cayley HamiDElton is a competitive game about accounting shenanigans, as you try to report a lower income in order to pay less taxes, but could get caught.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of a deck of cards which show your profits on one side and the potential fine on the other. In a round, each player puts out one card, profit side down, and the players have an auction of decreasing bids, to declare how low of a profit you're willing to claim.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once there is only one person left, they take on the title of accountant, and slowly reveal the cards everyone played.  If the sum is less than the declared amount, everyone takes their own card as points and the accountant also takes a bonus card. If the sum is more, the accountant takes all excess cards as penalties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The person with the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
