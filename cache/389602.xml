						               													<description>INTRODUCTION: Word-Go-Round is a game of strategy and skill that can be enjoyed by anyone old enough to spell. All players stay involved throughout the game since each player is competing not only with other players to accumulate the largest sum of money, but also with himself in striving to make the best possible words from his available letter tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECT: The object of Word-Go-Round is to accumulate the greatest amount of money possible by filling one&amp;rsquo;s individual word card with as many well paying words as possible. Words are formed from letter tiles which are bought when a player&amp;rsquo;s marker lands on the letters on the playing board. Players earn money with each word successfully spelled out on their individual word cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
