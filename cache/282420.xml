						               													<description>Retro Hero is the first of many games for the Retro Gamer Device. Players start by randomly selecting 5 level cards (this is your cartridge) and inserting them into their Retro Gamer Device. Each level has a predetermined number of turns so players must try and make the best with the options they're presented.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal is to collect points while navigating across levels, moving with the help of shapes chosen from the options rolled on your adventure dice. Points are mainly collected by covering as many empty spaces as possible (venture points); defeating creatures scattered across the levels; and using a key to open the lock. There are also several other ways of accumulating points such as Treasure Cards and Side Quests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Items found in a level are collected when covered, adding to your player board or wallet. When covering creatures, players attack by drawing cubes from a bag. Successful attacks earn you points while taking hits will cost you health. Players can press their luck to earn maximum points but risk dying in the process.  If a player does run out of health during an attack, they lose a point as consequence but are revived on their next turn, continuing from where they left off.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Treasure Cards that are collected are added to the limited slots on your player board to help you along the way. Their content ranges between Spells, Companions, and Special Items.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bombs are a vital part of the game as they enable players to take shortcuts and sometimes access items that are otherwise unavailble. If a player wishes to cover a brick with their chosen shape, they will need to spend a bomb. Bombs (like all items) are either collected or purchased.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Retro Hero is a truly unique dungeon crawling experience with up to 40 levels to choose from and 11 different shapes to dictate your every move. The player with the most points becomes the Ultimate Retro Hero!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
