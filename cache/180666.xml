						               													<description>&amp;quot;Bruno is out of the game, after this stunning blow from Alexia, leaving only two fighters standing!&amp;quot;, the speaker shouted with excitement. Under the blazing sunlight, there was Alexia, mocking, taunting Marow as he was standing wounded and silent. This was the grand finale everyone was waiting for. You could feel how fired up the crowd was, shouting for more. Marow`s artifact burst into scarlet energy as we cheered for him, breaking his silence into a violent battle cry rushing towards Alexia. A clash we will never forget unfolded before our very eyes! All these moments, carved into our minds for an eternity to come. This is the battle of eternal moments!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In FIRED UP! Eternal Moments you take on the role of a spectator in an arena where combatants from all over the lands gather, with the sole purpose of creating unforgettable moments for all to see. As the spectator, you can influence Fighters with your energy and excitement, in order to alter the outcome of the battle to your liking.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to leave the event as fired up as possible. Therefore the winner of the game will be the player who will manage to gather the most Fired up Points. &amp;#10;The game is played over several Rounds. Each Round consists of the following 3 Main Phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;a) Planning Phase:  All players may simultaneously place face down in front of them 1 or 2 Moment Cards. These Cards represent specific situations that the player, as a spectator, anticipates and wishes to experience in this Round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;b) Influence Phase: Players roll the dice and choose which Fighter and in which way they want to influence. The goal of each player is to increase the odds of what he/she has bet during the Planning Phase. The players can influence the target opponent of each Fighter, the Speed of a Fighter, his/her Defend or Attack Power and his/her Morale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;c) Battle Phase: During this phase, battles between Fighters take place, rolling the respective attack and defence dice. In the duration of this phase, players may reveal their successful Moment Cards and receive the corresponding Fired Up Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when there is one or none Fighter left in the arena!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;FIRED UP! Eternal Moments&amp;quot; took the 1st place in the 6th annual Greek Board Game Designing Contest (2015) under the name &amp;quot;Nauthriva&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The publisher of this game, &amp;quot;Purple Games&amp;quot;, closed due to personal reasons and all the rights of Fired Up returned to the designers.&amp;#10;If you are a publisher and interested in this game contact &amp;quot;Theofilos Koutroubis&amp;quot; in bgg or in the following e-mail: theofiloskoutroubis@yahoo.gr &amp;#10;A lot of love and effort was put in this game and we hope that it finds another warm home. Thank you for your understanding :)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
