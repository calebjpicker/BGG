						               													<description>A competitive skirmish nano card game by Charles Ward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SUMMARY&amp;#10;Players play on a card size board with 9 spaces. The spaces are not connected equally and some spaces have an advantage when doing a ranged attack. Players move tokens on the board trying to eliminate the opponent's pieces and be as close as possible to their opponent's picnic spot at the end of the game. Players take actions by playing their hand of 8 cards, or both sides of the four cards. The game ends at the end of round 8, or after all cards have been played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAMEPLAY&amp;#10;Players choose 1 card from their hand (either the top or bottom half of that card) and simultaneously reveal them. The player with the highest initiative number (in the coin) goes first, and each player either takes 1 of the 2 actions on their card's chosen half or passes. Cards that have been played once are flipped from the silver coin side to the gold coin side and return to the players hand; cards played twice are discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn a player may move 1 or more of their tokens, attack in the same location or a target location, block, hide, taunt, or add 1 reinforcement. Although the actions are resolved in order (highest number card), a block or hide can cancel a certain type of attack as a reaction or preemptively.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after 8 rounds, when all cards have been discarded. Equidistant tokens are removed after which the player nearest to the opponent's star wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
