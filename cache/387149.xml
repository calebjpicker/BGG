						               													<description>A competitive strategy game of sword, sorcery &amp;amp; mutations for 2 to 6 players. Each player controls a Knight, only 1 will survive and win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players will move on the map and collect items and abilities that will help them improve their knight and defeat the other players. Not only items such as weapons will be available but also traps, body mutations and &amp;quot;mystical powers&amp;quot; will improve the character to give them an advantage against their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The turns will take place in an always different fashion so that the order of the moves will be very important in determining who can attack (and kill) first. The players will wage war against each other on a no quarter battle, collecting loot for every kill.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The last man standing is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
