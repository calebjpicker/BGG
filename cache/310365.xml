						               													<description>It is now 2026 post corona and mutants roam freely and you are the last of humanity&amp;rsquo;s remnants. You and your followers fight to escape the planet by any means necessary. Compete against other&amp;#10;factions in a race for resources, weapons and to be the only one to escape in a colonization ship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    DNA Deck- These cards come in 4 values and 2 different colors(back). 2,3,4 and 5. The 2 and 5 pieces have red backs, while the 3 and 4 pieces have greenbacks.  Collecting these cards will help solve the molecular DNA crisis and create a cure for the COVID-Z21 virus. When any player accumulates a sum of 10 or more DNA, then the game can be won!&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Schematics Cards (52 card Deck) - Rare cards that will allow a faction to create a spaceship to escape the planet. Collect 15 schematics in order to win the game by leaving the rest of humanity behind in order to colonize the stars. Only 7 of these cards exist in the entire game!&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Survivor Deck - A deck of cards that have survivors in them. Each survivor has a unique ability which will improve your chances at surviving the epidemic. When all survivors are gone, game over! &amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Tools Deck - This deck holds items and tools that can be used to survive the Zombie Plague. This includes weapons, defense tools , resources , med kits and more.&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Threat Deck - Cards which feature various zombie threats and humanoid threats courtesy of the Illuminati. Defeat zombies to harvest valuable DNA, while you must contend with illuminati threats to survive!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set Up&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Determine turn order amongst yourselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Each deck should be shuffled well before the game begins. &amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Deal 5 cards from the Survivor deck to each player. In turn, each player should place their Survivor cards face up in front of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Add the Schematics cards to the Tools Deck as well as the remainder of the Survivor Deck. Shuffle the new Tool Deck well.&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Each player should also now be dealt 3 cards from the Tools Deck. Place the remaining Tool Deck cards face down in the center of the play area.&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    Place all of the remaining decks (Tool and Threat Decks) face down in the center of the playing area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With this the game is ready to begin!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The purpose of the game is to collect a sum of 10 schematic cards, the first to do this wins. Players can choose to help or hinder each other during this process.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alternatively, if any player manages to collect 20, DNA cards and to sacrifice 5 cards, the game will end!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You lose if:&amp;#10;1.    Another player collects a sum of 20 or greater DNA material.&amp;#10;2.    A player collects 10 schematics cards to complete the process of building an escape ship.&amp;#10;3.    You lose all survivors in your faction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Collecting DNA Cards&amp;#10;Perhaps the easiest way to win is to collect DNA cards. Each has a value listed on it which denotes the value of the DNA within. Collect a sum of 20 or more to win. This can be done in four ways:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    You can defeat a zombie to collect 1 DNA card.&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    You can obtain them through bartering with other factions (players).&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143;    You can steal or syphon them from other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turns and Turn Actions&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has several actions they can take during a turn. These determine how the game progresses and are listed below:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.    Place a card in play. This varies based on type of card, but generally there are no limits to the amount of cards you can have / place in play throughout the duration of a game or in a single turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The exception to this is Survivor cards, of which you can only have a maximum of 10.&amp;#10;2.    Draw a Threat card. This must be done every turn. You will either need to resolve your battle or you will have the freedom to take one or more other actions. [See Battle Resolution]&amp;#10;3.    Sacrifice 2 cards to draw from the DNA Deck.&amp;#10;4.    Sacrifice 2 cards to draw from the Tools Deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of these four potential actions, #1 and #4 have no limitation on the number of times they can be performed during a turn. #2 and #3 can only be performed once per turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, the player must make sure they have no more than 6 cards of any type in their hand at the end of the round. If you have more than six cards in hand you must make a decision as to which you&amp;rsquo;d like to discard, or offer them to other players in order to make a deal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player has performed all four of, or the actions they desire to perform for that turn, turn order moves to the next person in gameplay. When it isn&amp;rsquo;t your turn there are a few things you can do as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.    Barter with other players. This includes assisting them, or bribing them so that you don&amp;rsquo;t hinder them.&amp;#10;2.    Play cards against other players. This can come from your hand only, not previously active cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues in this way until winning conditions are fulfilled by one faction player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
