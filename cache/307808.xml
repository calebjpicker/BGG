						               													<description>&amp;quot;Grandpa, can you tell again the story of when all the toilet paper in the world disappeared?&amp;quot; The old man's face closed, stripped of his usual smile. And, as he pulled the children into his lap, all those memories kept within him, closed by the invisible key of the passage of time, began to flow. His voice sounded calm and painful. &amp;ldquo;In that strange period of our lives, there were a number of people who, without reason, decided to use up all the toilet paper in the world. These people were part of a radical terrorist movement called P.O.O.H., which basically meant the Party of the Organized and Obsessive Hoarders.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PAPER ROLL &amp;amp; Write is a roll &amp;amp; write game, for 2 players. One of the players takes command of the Party of the Organized and Obsessive Hoarders (hereinafter referred to as P.O.O.H.), whose aim is to try to deplete the toilet paper stock in the stores, leading the population to total panic. The other player assumes the role of Coordinator of a group of specialists called by the government to resolve this crisis, ensuring the production and supply of paper to the city.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each round, the P.O.O.H rolls a certain number of dice. Then, the Coordinator chooses how many dice will be used during that round by BOTH players. For each dice that he decides not to use during that round, panic increases by 1.  The more dice the Coordinator choses, the more dice he and the P.O.O.H. will use. The more dice he choses not to use, the more the panic increases.&amp;#10;The Coordinator will use dice to produce and distribute paper across stores, while P.O.O.H will use the same dice to accumulate bonuses in his headquarters and to visit stores on the map, buying all the paper and spread the panic, while avoiding being slowed down by the police.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Coordinator wins the game if at least 5 stores are supplied with paper. &amp;#10;The P.O.O.H. wins the game if the panic reaches the end of the panic track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end of each round, players exchange the game sheets they have in their possession. This creates a constant back and forth between players, because the sheet that one player is currently using, will be used by the other player in the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also, the Coordinator and the POOH play two completely different types of games, which highly increases replayability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;PAPER ROLL &amp;amp; write is a free Print &amp;amp; Play Roll &amp;amp; Write board game for two players. But for us it is more than a game, it is a cheerful and positive manifesto in times of uncertainty, and a joint effort from 3 designers in Lockdown due to Covid-19.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
