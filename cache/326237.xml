						               													<description>During the premiere, Juliet thrusts a stage dagger into herself on stage in front of a full house. As Juliet dies, it becomes clear &amp;ndash; Somebody must have switched the prop with a real dagger.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to the exciting world of Minebury City Theater! You have all been working towards this premiere for a long time: &amp;ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&amp;rdquo; by William Shakespeare.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But the production seems ill-fated. Patrick was rejected a few weeks ago when he asked Juliet&amp;rsquo;s hand in marriage. As a result, everyone was anxious to see how it would turn out when the two lead actors appeared on stage together. At first the premiere seemed to run smoothly. At 8:00 pm, the curtain rose in front of a full house. The play lasted three hours including the intermission.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the play, at 11:00 pm, the tragedy occurred: Juliet had picked up the stage dagger behind the stage from among the other props. She dramatically thrust the blade into her body. At first the audience was enthralled by her impressive performance. But when Patrick saw Juliet&amp;rsquo;s blood and called out for a doctor, the audience realized what they had just witnessed was in fact a real tragedy: Somebody had switched the stage dagger with a real knife.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Arriving shortly after, the emergency services could do nothing but pronounce Juliet dead at the scene. The question is: which of the people present is responsible for Juliet&amp;rsquo;s gruesome death?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What is a murder mystery game?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &amp;ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&amp;rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME CONTENT:&amp;#10;1 Game Manual, 8 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 8 name badges, 1 support code&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash; description from the publisher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
