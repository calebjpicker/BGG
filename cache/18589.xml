						               													<description>Sextett is a collection of 6 abstract strategy games packaged in one box.  According to the rules none of these games had been published before, although in fact at least a few are traditional games. Ravensburger catalog #12.026&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game box includes several sets of multi colored pawns used in all games and 3 double sided hard playing boards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The games included are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Quicki - a dice rolling race game where players move around an abstract grid of points trying to reach their colored places in the board center, players can be sent back to their starting places by other players choosing to land on their current position.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ponte - from the translated rulebook: The object of the game is to reach the island by crossing streets and bridges with one figure as fast as possible and then build a tower and reach it by jumps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Magic Star - The object of the game is to try to move clockwise around the star on the outer or inner path beginning from the starting point.  The player who manages to get all of his game figures into his own star corner first wins the game.  A blockade figure constantly changes the aspect of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Piggy Back - The object of the game is to get all the figures across the board first, whereby the players are forced at times to carry the opponent's figures &amp;quot;piggy-back&amp;quot; across the board or even to be carried in the same way themselves in order to reach their destination.  The point of the game is to try to take advantage of the piggy back rule whenever possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fox Jumping - A gathering of foxes (2 or 4 fox families make 40 foxes) is disturbed by a hunting party.  Hastily each fox tried to hide in one of the 39 neighboring dens.  But since there is room for one fox in each den, the slowest fox loses the race.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Surakarta - This game originated in Indonesia.   It bears the name of the old time-honored city of Surakarta on the island of Middle Java.  The game is played on a grid of points with all points on the outer edge connected by a curved line that leads back to another board edge.  The idea is to move your pawns around the grid trying to get to a curved line that can be used to move to another side of the board and more importantly eliminate your opponents pawn.  The game is played actively in Indonesia by drawing lines in the ground and playing with pebbles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
