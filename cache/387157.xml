						               													<description>The deck consists of 7 animal cards, 7 food cards, and 7 location cards. Each card displays 5 clues about its subject. The picture on each card is repeated on one of 7 &amp;quot;endemic set&amp;quot; tiles. Each such tile displays a picture of each type and can be claimed by the first player to collect all three cards of the set during the game. One card of each type is secretly placed in an envelope, as in Clue. The rest of the cards are dealt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A die determines which hemisphere a player may visit on his turn. A second die determines whether a player (i) asks another player to read aloud a clue about a specified card type in that other player's hand, (ii) asks another player to give him a specific card, or (iii) names one card of each type and asks another player to give him one of those cards. A location in a request must be the location that the player is visiting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player correctly guesses the contents of the envelope. Points are scored for ending the game, for collecting the cards that constitute endemic sets, and for optionally reading aloud some clues displayed on cards that one receives during the game. Most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
