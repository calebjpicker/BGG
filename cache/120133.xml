						               													<description>Fist Fight Club &amp;ndash; The Dice Game (FFC) is a custom dice game for some fast and furious fist fight action with your mates.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed to be a fast play game, FFC is perfect for filling those times when other games are just too long (you know, like when your at your games club and have ten minutes to kill with your mates, or when you're waiting for a train).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How does it play? Well, here is the abridged version for two player games:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have 6 custom dice each, these dice have attack and defence icons on. They roll the dice to build up a 'fighting hand' with which to fight each other. Of the 6 dice, 3 are on show to all, three are kept secret.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The attacking players attack by playing one of their dice that shows an attack value. The defending player must play a die that shows the correct defense value to counter the attack value played on them. The attacker then plays a die with an attack value that counters the defense die just played by the defender.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This continues until one player is unable to play a die. If the defender can't play a die, they take a point of damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For games of more than 2 players, the actions gets even more intense as players attack who they want with the winner being the player with the least amount of damage taken when the first player to take all their damage is knocked out. So, attacking the player with the most damage isn't always the best tactic!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Capable of filling just as little as 5 minutes for two players but capable of being a big as you want. The more players you add, the more fun it is.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Being compact, it's easy to always having FFC with you. This means you and your mates never end up sitting around with nothing to do at your local club/store as you wait for your opponents to turn up. Just get out your dice and throw down with some mates for some real &amp;lsquo;underground fight club&amp;rsquo; action as a warm up for your main event!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
