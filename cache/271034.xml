						               													<description>There are 3 cards in the middle of the table that make up the ocean and that have 3 separate actions you can take. Each player has a boat that they move to the selected action they want to do on their turn. If both players take the same action whomever arrived at that spot second gets a weaker action they can take. Also, you may not take the same action twice in a row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions you can take:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trade - You may trade with the available cards that are in the market or draw one card from the deck. The amount of cards you may trade are equal to the number on the card, (which moves up and down during the game like a mini stock market) If you are the second boat to arrive on this spot you can trade one less card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fish - You may draw cards equal to the number on your fisherman card that you have leveled up to. If you are the second boat to arrive you draw one less card from the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sell - If you move your boat to this space the seagull switches to the player it is currently not with. (Seagull forces you to pay one extra when selling) &amp;#10;On this space you may sell to the fancy man. On his card is a row of numbers that slowly grows each time he's sold to and is also the amount you must sell to him. There is a small 5 card deck next to him with the top card revealed that shows what sardine can the fancy man is wanting to be sold. When a fancy man sale is made you raise the trade market number up one, your fisherman up one, and the fancy man up one on their respective trackers. After selling to the fancy man you flip over the sardine can to show it has been sold to you and you gain points based on how many you acquire by the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game you are collecting sets of cans or a variety pack which is all 5 brands of cans. These cans can be sold, and count as points. Once the fancy man has been sold 5 cans the game ends and the player who did not trigger the end game gets one last turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Player with the most points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
