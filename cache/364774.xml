						               													<description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to make our Community Garden thrive! Players will use Gardeners to gather resources like water and compost and then will play cards ranging from dill to strawberries to butternut squash. The player who has scored the most points through growing their garden and collecting Harvest cards wins the game. But this is a community garden, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be helping your fellow players acquire the resources they need to make their plots prosper as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Community Garden is played over 7 rounds, in which players are aiming to collect resources - water, compost, trowels, and seedlings - in order to play Garden cards, such as oregano, collard greens, and shishito pepper. On their turn, players will place one Gardener on the board to gain resources, gain Garden cards, or to use Tool cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will also be collecting Green Thumbs, which are then spent in order to join other players in busy garden spaces. Green Thumbs also have another benefit: they often allow you to activate Tool cards. Each Tool card has a unique effect, and when you place a Gardener on a tool, you use the effect listed on the card. This might help you gain a number of resources at once, take an extra turn, or create other combinations of effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players also use their Gardeners to draw cards from the Garden beds, strategically adding new Garden Cards to their hand that will give them points and helpful bonuses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each player's turn, after they've placed a gardener, they'll be able to spend resources they've collected to plant (play) Garden cards from their hand. They'll then place the Garden card they've just played in collections in front of them into plots of the same color. And any time a player completes a pair of the same color of Garden cards (such as two brown Garden cards) or a row of all the colors (brown, pink, silver, and red), they will draw bonus Harvest cards. Each Harvest card is randomly worth anywhere from 1 to 3 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After 7 rounds, the player who has scored the most points through planting Garden cards and collecting Harvest cards, wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
