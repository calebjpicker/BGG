						               													<description>These rules are designed for a player to control many capital ships in a major fleet action. They are designed to allow players to refight the huge space battles of the Exterminator War.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are a couple of other sets of Universe-based rules already in existence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    HELLFIRE, which allows players to control a single ship in considerable detail.&amp;#10;    Big Burn is for small fleet actions with a degree of detail as to what damage is done.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This set of rules are another step in the abstraction process, designed to make a battle playable in an hour or less, and several battles in a campaign context practical in an evening.&amp;#10;The basic rules concept is a direct steal from the excellent WRG game 'Seastrike' published in, I think 1974.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inevitably, that original system has mutated somewhat in its conversion to the Universe, and this system is an attempt to reflect the doctrine and practice of 300+ years of space combat in the Universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space battles in the Universe generally take place in the orbital space around a colony world. Combat is generally not 'to the death', and fleets will usually withdraw if overmatched.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is also very greatly influenced by political constraints and the consequent rules of engagement. Similarly, the loss of a capital ship is a major economic loss as it takes a year and a half to build a replacement, and it has significant credit value. (See the Macro Rules for the Humanity Will Prevail Campaign). Captains and admirals are schooled with the prevailing ethos &amp;ndash; which is that if an enemy ship breaks off combat you let it go (after all, it might be you next time).&amp;#10;Much of this was challenged during the Exterminator War &amp;ndash; where the enemy was an implacable machine intelligence &amp;ndash; so when fighting Exterminators the loss of ships is expected. However, that specific threat has now receded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
