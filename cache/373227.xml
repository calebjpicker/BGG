						               													<description>The name 3KSES is a combination of words &amp;quot;Three games&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tricks&amp;quot; into one word TRIKSES. &amp;#10;Three easy-to-learn games in one box. &amp;#10;66 triangular play chips(tokens) in this game are made from wood and both side printed, from one side is a thematic colourful painting of one of famous world architectural jewels. From other side is printed an ornament. Each chip has on the sides 3 different symbols, made as shaped cutouts, it is a triangle, a square and a circle. 6 play chips from 66 are rare POWERCHIPS, they are described with cut-through marks. Game rules are based on using the pictures or using the cutouts. No gameboard is needed, only small piece of flat place is enough to play 3KSES. &amp;#10;Two players compete against each other, 4 and 6 players then builds a team which is cooperating and competing other team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 1 | FIND A MATCH  - 66 play chips are placed on table in 11 groups, 6 pieces of chips i each group. Players are trying to find 2 pictures of the same building to get a MATCH, in the end of the game the winner with more pairs wins the game. IT is good memory fitness training.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 2 | JOINTS - 66 play chips are distributed to players, each player gets same amount of chips and put in a stack in front of them in a column. The shaped cutout symbols on the chips are used here. First player put first play chip from his stack on a desk and other player can lay one of his chips to connect it only with the same symbol to one of the chips laying on the table, it makes a JOINT between two connected chip. For each JOINT made player plays one new chip, so if it makes 2 JOINTs - is playing 2 times in his turn, gives quicklier chips from his stack to the table. The trick is to get a combination of more chips near each other to build 2 or 3 JOINTs in one time. &amp;#10;POWERCHIPS is special, of course, doesn't need to be played out when in top of stack, but can be put near for later use and play normal chip instead. POWERCHIP has the ability to turn chips to get a compatible shape for connection.   &amp;#10;Player or team who first gets rid of all chips of their stack is a Winner. It is great logic fitness training.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 3 | TAMITADY - 66 play chips are mixed and each player gets 1 POWERCHIP and any 6 pieces of normal chips. One player to players, each player gets same amount of chips and put in a stack in front of them. The shaped cutout symbols on the chips are used here. First player put first play chip from his stack on a desk and other player can lay one of his chips to connect it only with the same symbol to one of the chips laying on the table. For each connection made is played one new chip,so player which connect one chip to 2 other chips, is playing 2 times in his turn, gives quicklier chips from his stack to the table. The trick is to get a combination of more chips near each other to connect 2 or 3 in one time.  &amp;#10;Player or team who first gets rid of all chips of their stack is a Winner. It is a great logic fitness training.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
