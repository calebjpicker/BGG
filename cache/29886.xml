						               													<description>From the Rules&amp;#10;This game was devised to enable the therapist to learn about the underlying psychological processes of such children, in a way that is non-threatening. It utilizes the vehicle of the standard game--so universally appealing to children--and the elicitation of responses via token reinforcement. The game has proved helpful in shortening the therapeutic process--not only because it provides the therapist with information earlier than he would have otherwise obtained it, but also because it facilitates the child's freeing himself enough to reveal his previously suppressed and repressed thoughts, feelings, and actions. The game can be useful in both individual and group psychotherapy with children. And even the child who will engage in direct discussion, psychoanalytic inquiry, and fantasy play can find it a pleasurable additional psychotherapeutic experience. It is most useful in treatment of children between the ages of four (children younger than that cannot usually  play board games) and twelve (the adolescent will often consider the game &amp;quot;babyish&amp;quot;).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IMPORTANT NOTICE&amp;#10;Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game was designed to be used only by mental health professionals in their therapeutic work with children. Accordingly , every reasonable attempt is made to limit the sale and distribution of the game to such professionals. Use of the game by parents with their own children is therapeutically contraindicated. Most parents are not trained to provide appropriate therapeutic responses to the cards. And even those who are, are not likely to have the objectivity with their own children that is necessary for optimum utilization of the game. Lastly, such play with parents will compromise the child's use of the game with his or her therapist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
