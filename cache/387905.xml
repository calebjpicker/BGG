						               													<description>Meet Finley, a master of deception. You look left, Finley runs right. You look right, Finley's... well... we don't know.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finley's escaped again, and you're assigned to investigate. Study the intelligence reports and the expansive full-color map to determine which building Finley is hiding in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But here's the catch: you don't have all of the intelligence yet. It's a race between players to strategically swap intelligence cards and get the information needed to find Finley first!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Start the game by selecting a challenge card. Each challenge card has 12 affiliated intelligence cards, which are distributed evenly amongst players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Review your intelligence cards, take notes on your Investigator's Notepad, and roll the die to swap cards with another player. Each card has a different piece of information that you can use to build a picture of Finley's movements -- once you think you have enough data, you can guess Finley's location. The first player to correctly guess Finley's location on the map wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
