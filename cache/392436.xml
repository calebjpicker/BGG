						               													<description>Bernadette Octavia the Witch has been cursed by the twelve Zodiac demons. She now aim to defeat the red dragon Jamil Hendock to acquire his book of curse removal. Hiring adventurer to help her achieve her goal, so did the dragon. A battle of epic proportion ensue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skullbites is a tricktaking game where the loser (lowest card) of the trick get damaged by all the other player's cards. Each player is given two Adventurer cards with an health value on them and a passive skill, one is played face up and the other is hidden face down. The two camp bosses are hidden among those adventurers. Once an adventurer is defeated, a player reveal their hidden adventurer and continue the game with the newly revealed character.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When losing a trick, you can block incoming damage by exhausting one of the three elemental shields chip each player has (wind, water and fire) but each shield has a one time use so be careful when to use it!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some storytellers will help bring balance, but ultimately the war won't end until one of the two camp leader is defeated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
