						               													<description>Dreams, strategy and action ... this is how an Empire is created. Invest in properties and companies, accumulating wealth and doing business around the world, with this strategy game that will make you a millionaire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Imperio (&amp;quot;Empire&amp;quot;) is a board game, in which each player will try to build their own business empire. Inspired by the market economy, Imperio proposes to simulate the economic growth of people in the real world, through the purchase of goods in any of the 34 cities of the planisphere.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will be able to acquire houses, buildings, restaurants and hotels or set up your own factory to sell products all over the planet and manage them by moving with your own plane. You can even have your own casino, while increasing your economic power. These goods can be purchased in any of the 34 cities in which the planisphere is divided, while you move along the path of the board with your avatar. Your profession can also help in this exciting enrichment career. The acquisition of new cities will allow you to increase the number of goods at your disposal, giving you greater chances of winning the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Although the objective is common to all players, the strategy is their own, so taking into account market conditions, at any time during the game, you can change your strategy to win the game. The first player to meet the goal of $ 1,000,000 wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players move along the track and advance to the position indicated by the dice. Once the city is acquired, the player has the right to collect a rent for it and can additionally invest in different goods to increase the rent. Investments can be real estate such as houses, buildings and towers with a different value for each one, both for the purchase and the income obtained. Another type of investment can be in businesses such as hotels and restaurants, which have a variable income or a casino that, being the most expensive, can be acquired when there is already capital, but the profit obtained is quite high when the players fall into that town. And finally another type of investment is the acquisition of factories that allows players to buy inputs and sell products to the rest of the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Market conditions may vary throughout the game and may make it necessary to modify the strategy. Likewise, these changes also allow obtaining high dividends for those who can take advantage of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
