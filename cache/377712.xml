						               													<description>Wildlife is in danger and the animals are calling for help! Little critters with different problems have come into your care and need you to save them. Cure their ailments and get them ready for release. The rescuer with the happiest and healthiest animals at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a family friendly card game where you have to balance trying to get the most points while also curing as many animals as possible before the game is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is dealt 6 animal cards and 6 ailment cards, face up on the table in front of you. These are the animals in your rescue that you will need to care for. Then each player gets a hand of 5 cards from the game deck. The game deck consists of cure cards and ability cards, and are used to progress the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turns are simple; the player draws a card from the game deck, and then plays a card (or discards an unwanted card). The turn is then moved on to the next player, clockwise. Cure cards are played on animal and ailment pairs in your rescue, which turns them into a &amp;quot;success story&amp;quot;. Success stories are what give you points at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are ability and instant ability cards in the game deck. Instant ability cards can be played out of turn, as a reaction (for example to skip a certain player or block an ability card from being played). Normal ability cards are used during your turn and as described on the card. Some abilities will allow you to play cards from the discard pile, take cards from another player's hand, or get extra points for an animal in your care.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends immediately once a player cures their last animal, and then all players count the points gained from their Success Stories. The player with the most points wins! In the case of a tie, the player with the most animals cured wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
