						               													<description>From the game:  Johann Sebastian Bach was a composer who lived in the 18th century.  He is known as one of the greatest composers of classical music.  Bach is also an exciting game of chance and skill that introduces some basic elements of music theory without detracting from the playability of the game.  Bach is a thoughtful and cahallenging game for anyone from the age of 10 to adult, regardless of any previous knowledge of music theory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player takes turns drawing cards and moving notes to form scales.  The first player to form the required scales wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first game may take about 1 1/2 hours.  Once you know how to play, each game will average about an hour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game components are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 board&amp;#10;26 plastic chips with green and blue stickers on opposite sides.&amp;#10;2 information cards&amp;#10;23 key cards&amp;#10;65 interval cards&amp;#10;rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is placed between opponents so that each is facing one of the note rows corresponding to the color on their chips.  All notes are place on the note rows so that each note matches the letters and symbols in each square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards are separated into two decks of interval and key cards and placed face down beside the board.  The green player draws the top key card.  It tells you the scales that you have to form to win the game, and it must stay hidden until the end of the game.  The blue player does the same.  The rest of the key cards are put away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The green player always goes first.  He/she draws an interval card, showing it to their opponent.  The card tells how many squares you can move one &amp;quot;note&amp;quot; as well as the direction that can be moved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play continues until one of the players has formed their scales, and shouts &amp;quot;I win&amp;quot; or something similar.  If this is shouted and the player has not formed their correct scales, play continues and that player loses a turn.  The game is over when one player has completed the scales indicated on their interval card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
