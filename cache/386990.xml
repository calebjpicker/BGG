						               													<description>Fifty-six cards numbered one through ten are all dealt. Players take turns placing one or more cards face down onto a stack and announcing their value, which must be one less than or one greater than the value of the card(s) played by the previous player. The direction of play and the direction of value (rising or falling) can be altered by special cards. Players can challenge the announced value. The loser of the challenge collects the stack of played cards. The first player to rid his hand of cards wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
