						               													<description>Lords of Lore and Loot is a turn based game that allows each player to build their kingdom from within, explore their surroundings, and defeat the other players. Each round consists of accounting for income, building improvements in their kingdom, training combat units, and exploring the countryside with the player's heroes. The heroes can amass an army of various combat units available to each player in their kingdom according to their faction. They can explore the areas surrounding their kingdom, defeat rogue warbands guarding resources, buildings, mines, and artifacts. Experience is gained from defeating rogue warbands and another player's armies. Those guarded treasures can be used to grow the player's kingdom and armies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place over a series of Weeks (turns) and Months (4 consecutive turns). Each week players collect gold for from their kingdom. Each month players collect resources from their mines and controlled buildings. Each player's turn consists of actions they can perform. Collect gold. Move their hero up to their movement speed. Engage with any space along their moved path. Spend gold on an improvement in their kingdom. Spend experience to level their hero up. Learn spells and abilities to aid their fighting armies. Fight rogue warbands or other players to take control of valuable spaces. Dice, from the d4 up to the d20, will be used to fight and perform abilities. Each player controls a faction with a set list of units with various combat characteristics and prompts for which dice to use.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player that conquers all other players or the objectives set out in the chosen scenario wins the game. Conquering a player happens when a player no longer has a kingdom or a hero. They are then removed from the game. Specific scenarios will outline additional game mechanics and win conditions. There is no set number of turns or time limit for the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
