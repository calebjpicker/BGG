						               													<description>Muffin Mythos is a semi-coop all vs. one game of Cthulhu fighting goodness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All of the armies of the world have been defeated by the legendary monster Cthulhu. Civilization has crumbled beneath the chaos and destruction. Mankind is left defeated and without hope of any salvation. An unlikely group of rebels have come together to defeat the monster. They call themselves the Shepherds. Coming together in unity has not been easy for the Shepherds, as some of them only fight for personal glory and gain. However they are united through one common purpose: defeat Cthulhu, and save the future of mankind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With all the world's armies defeated, salvation seems impossible. Until one day, a small peculiar stranger appears covered head to toe by a robe. He speaks in a low grizzly voice, muttering to himself as he limps towards them. What appears to be crumbs fall to the floor with every word he mumbles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;I'm too late, they won't listen.&amp;quot; he grumbles to himself. &amp;quot;Doom. Doom.&amp;quot; The stranger hobbles closer to the Shepherds, more crumbs falling to the ground as he moves. &amp;quot;Hope, there is hope. You must listen. You must find them.&amp;quot; The stranger grabs hold of the collar of a Shepherd pulling himself close.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Find the Muffins.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The stranger collapses to the floor and seems to disappear as crumbs scatter across the room.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Muffin Mythos players will build an army by rolling and re-rolling dice in farkle, or yahtzee style. Players recruit their army by scoring their dice without rolling a Cthulhu symbol on a custom wood engraved die. They may also explore the city and find companions, and items which will help them in their quest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One player will play as Cthulhu and will roll dice in a similar way, but instead of recruiting an army the Cthulhu player will destroy townspeople and the town itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players may optionally choose to brawl with their friends in order to raise their army's power and ultimately be the sole Shepherd responsible for defeating Cthulhu.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player believes their army is strong enough to defeat Cthulhu, they may engage Cthulhu in battle. Once a player is engaged they may not disengage or allow Cthulhu to take a special attack against the players army. If a player's army is defeated they lose all items and companions and start back in the town with nothing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cthulhu wins when he defeats a certain number of townspeople or destroys a certain number of town cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players win by either single handedly defeating Cthulhu, or working together to defeat him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
