						               													<description>Based on the comedy film, A&amp;#197;&amp;#165; &amp;#197;&amp;#190;ij&amp;iacute; ryt&amp;iacute;&amp;#197;&amp;#153;i! (&amp;quot;Long live the knights!&amp;quot;) is a tower defense game with 2 levels of difficulty - one for children age 7-12 and the other, more advance version, for gamers age 12 and up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round has 6 phases that are repeated until the end of the game is triggered.&amp;#10;Phase 1: Taking action card. Every player takes 6 action cards in the first round, in other rounds takes 3.&amp;#10;Phase 2: Evil knights are coming. The number of evil knights depends on the number of players. In the first round number of evil knights is the same as the number of players + two extra more, in other rounds without two extra more.&amp;#10;Phase 3: Playing action cards. Players use their cards to fight the evil knights. On their turn, players can play as many cards as they can. Players place their cards under evil knights, face down, and put a token in their color on top of it.&amp;#10;Phase 4: Action card payment. Action cards are turned face up (tokens must remain on the cards) and players pay the sum of their face up cards. If they can't pay, all of their face up cards are discarded. If they pay more than necessary, they don't get any money back.&amp;#10;Phase 5: Fighting knights. Evaluate every knight separately. If the sum of the action cards under a knight is greater than the power of the knight, a knight is defeated and the player gets a point. If the sum of the action cards is lower, knight survives (card is not discarded), action cards are discarded and tokens are returned to the player.&amp;#10;Phase 6: Knights attacking. Every knight that survived is going to attack the castle. Every knight attack after another. A knight can destroy a castle card only if his crest color matches the color of the castle card. This card is then discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After 7 rounds, if all the castle cards are destroyed, all players lose. If all the knight cards are used and the castle is still standing, you successfully defended the castle. All players are considered heroes, but only the player with the most points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
