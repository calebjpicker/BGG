						               													<description>Once upon a time there was someone who loved telling stories... well if you know that someone, then they'll be a winner at playing The Story Telling Game! Whether they tell tall, short, fairy or scary stories, this fast-paced game will be a best-seller for children aged six upwards who have a vivid imagination, a competitive streak and are quick thinking. The Story Telling Game is a great birthday and Christmas gift and it not only encourages creativity, but it will keep children entertained on rainy days and school holidays. Created for budding Jackanorys, The Story Telling Game sees each player start with five words on their cards and when the clock starts, the first players starts telling a story using one of their words. Then it's the turn of the next player who has to incorporate one of their words into the former player's story... and so it goes on with each player adding to the story with one of their words at a time until the buzzer declares that it's 'The End' for the player who's talking when the buzzer sounds. When this happens, the player has to pick up all the cards used by the other players and begin a new story, this time with the opening 'Twice upon a time'. The story doesn't have to win awards or be a work of literary genius - it can be about anything but has to include one of the words on each of their cards. The Smiley Trump card adds a twist to the game as it can be used as any word and if a player is caught out by the buzzer, the Smiley Trump means they get off scot-free and the next player has to collect all the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
