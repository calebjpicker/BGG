						               													<description>Who will be the fastest to find the odd one that crept into the image? An introductory game of observation and speed for sharp eagle eyes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all players are ready and paying attention, the active player turns over the first card in the pile and places it face up on the table. All players play at the same time and look at the card, searching for the odd one out: a small object or an animal that does not fit the theme of the scene on the card. The first player who thinks they found the odd one out places their index finger on the object and shouts its name. If the player gets it right, he wins the card and a new round begins. If the player gets it wrong, the round continues without them. To start a new round, the next player waits until everyone is ready and turns over a new card from the pile, and so on until all the cards have been turned over. The game ends when there are no more cards in the pile: the winner is whoever won the most cards!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
