						               													<description>A war game of a hypothetical 21st century US civil war, very topical with a dark twist on current events, a great conversation piece whether you are Conservative or Liberal. A mere four pages of rules means it&amp;rsquo;s easy to play. Components also include a playing map, popularity track and three sheets of cardstock playing pieces. Two or three players ages 12 to adult.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the game background:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After recent elections the Ruling Party gained control of the Presidency and a majority in both houses of Congress. They immediately set about to &amp;ldquo;restore the promise of America&amp;rdquo; through wide sweeping reforms. The rich were taxed. The poor received free health care, education, and housing. Big Business was regulated. The environment was saved. The civil rights of pornographers, illegal immigrants and underage children were preserved. The victory of Labor over their capitalist exploiters was assured for the first time since FDR.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But these reforms provoked equally widespread opposition from right-wing extremists. It became obvious that after the next election the minions of rich Wall Street capitalists would overturn many of the reforms and renew their attacks on the environment. The Christian Right stood ready to poison the minds of school children with creationist dogma. Only quick action by right-thinking patriots could save the Republic&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play the crusading Big Government do-gooders or their gun-toting Conservative opposition. Each turn players can choose from various political actions as they attempt to &amp;ldquo;save the Republic&amp;rdquo; in their own way. Eventually martial law will be declared and the game takes on more of a military nature, as bullets instead of ballots determine the destiny of America. The game features overseas garrisons, militia recruitment, terrorist attacks, packing the Supreme Court, the National Guard, defecting government troops, air strikes, UN intervention, mass arrests and more as each side tries to &amp;ldquo;restore the promise of America.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are written from a darkly humorous perspective and the game is fun to play, a real conversation starter. Explore various scenarios. Are freedom and the liberal agenda incompatible? Can we avoid civil war yet preserve our liberty? Find out with The Second American Revolution!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
