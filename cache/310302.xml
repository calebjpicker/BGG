						               													<description>A solo tactical game about the battles and struggles that the 1st Airborne division faced during the first few days of the drops and landings around the Arnhem/Oosterbeek area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You play as the British in this chit pull, paragraph driven game, the enemy may not be placed on the map until you spot them, or they spot you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before the game begins there are decisions to make. Which attached units do you want to add and how much additional ammo do you want to take. These come at a cost of a time/VP deduction. &amp;#10;Flip a chit and obey the instructions, chits allow platoons or groups to be activated, as well as passing of time, mortar actions, minefields and wire activations, random events etc. When one of your platoons is activated you give the platoon one of four orders, Hold, Advance, Assault or Recce. These orders allow your sections to make an action. As well as the usual combat,  movement and morale test other actions include spotting and special commanders actions such as the off map 3&amp;quot; mortar and sending a runner to replenish ammo. Certain orders will make the chosen actions easier to execute and more successful. A Hold order for example will not allow a move action, although a regroup action is possible. A Recce order will allow you to spot easier and not to be spotted by the enemy as easily but will not allow you to enter into combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the action phase has been completed for your platoon, a paragraph check is made. This will allow you to spot enemy units, buildings, bridges, be aware of any terrain modifiers within the hex. The level of awareness is attached to the actions and orders of your platoon. If you go charging around the map with an Assault order, don't be surprised to run into mines and wire and making the enemy aware of your position without spotting them in return as well as having less command over these units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The VPs are directly connected to the number of turns it takes to complete the game. But do not get complacent as you are never sure what lies ahead until you have read that last paragraph.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
