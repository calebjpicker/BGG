						               													<description>5D20 Football is a game built for the solo gamer. Everything runs off the roll of 5 d20 dice. The game is fairly simple yet has depth in how plays turnout. The tabletop version uses charts and dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin with the dice are rolled to get the play type, depth, and the who which is all based off a teams' offensive chart. The plays take into account the down, distance, and the ball location on the field. Later in the game, time left and the score can affect the play calls as well. This roll also on occasion can trigger a fumbled snap or a pre-snap penalty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the play is known we progress to the play itself which require rolling 5d20 dice. To start, the red die gets you the defender for the play (this player comes off the defensive teams chart), and who the player is also depends on the game situation (a passing situation is more likely to get a player from the secondary while a run play is more likely to have a lineman).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a PASS: The white die gives you how the defender affects the play. They can get pressure on a QB, get a chance to break up a pass, allow an open receiver, which will result in the receiver making a catch, a drop, or yards after a catch. The blue die is checked against the QB or the receiver, depending on what the defensive player allowed. The black die gets your yardage and the yellow die is for a possible penalty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For a RUN: The white die gives you how the defender affects the play. They can get penetration and hit a runner in the backfield, hit the runner at the line, or allow a hole for the runner to run through. The blue die gets how the runner reacts to what the defense gave them by spinning away from a loss, to breaking a run through a hole. The black die gets you the yardage gained and the yellow die is used for a possible penalty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special team plays are as simple as rolling the 5d20 and using them to get distance, the returner and yardage, along with chances for penalties and fumbles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are rated so that their impact in the game reflect their real life styles. So while the game may seem simple there is a ton of interaction allowing everything that happens in a football game to happen on the tabletop with 5D20 Football.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
