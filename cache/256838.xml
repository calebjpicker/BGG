						               													<description>In Nessos, you must embody Greek heroes who imprison mythological creatures into sacred amphoras in order to offer them to the gods. If you capture enough, you will reach the rank of gods' chosen One! But beware for Charon the terrible roams and will by all means try to make you take a one way trip to Hell!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, the players must bluff in order to win the Amphora cards which represent the most interesting creatures. When your turn comes, offer an Amphora card to another player. They can accept it, or refuse it by offering it to another player. Collect Amphora cards in order to be the first to reach the number of points required. But be careful, if you get three Charon cards, you lose the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play&amp;#10;Players start each round with 5 cards in their hands.&amp;#10;The game takes place in a undetermined number of rounds, until one of the three game-end conditions is met.&amp;#10;The player who has the first player pawn chooses a card in her hand of cards and offers it by putting it face down in front of another player of her choice.&amp;#10;If the card offered is a Creature card, she must say out loud the number of the card without lying.&amp;#10;If the card offered is a Charon card, she can (and should) lie by saying out loud any number she wishes.&amp;#10;The player who gets the card has 3 choices:&amp;#10;- He accepts the card before looking at it, and then places it face up in front of him.&amp;#10;- He refuses the card without looking at it. It returns to the player who offered it, and she places it face up in front of herself.&amp;#10;- He adds a card from his hand, face down, and offers the two cards to another player. He is only allowed to lie about the Charon cards by announcing the number he chooses.&amp;#10;In this third case, the player who receives the two cards has the same choices. &amp;#10;Cards cannot be offered to a player who has already been offered cards in this round, nor to the player with the First player pawn. The last player must either accept or refuse the cards offered.&amp;#10;Then a new round starts, the first player pawn moves to the left and players draw cards from the deck to refill their hands to 5 cards.&amp;#10;Having a 1 card, a 2 card and a 3 card in front of you gives you 10 bonus points (=16 points).&amp;#10;Players who have three Charon cards in front of them are sent to Hell and are eliminated from the game.&amp;#10;The player whose Creature cards reaches or exceeds the number of points required, wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
