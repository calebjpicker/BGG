						               													<description>Cubilete is an old and very traditional game in Cuba that is second in popularity only to Cuban dominoes. Similar cubilete games are played in other Latin American countries, but the rules vary all over the map, with many cultures playing a version that is very much like the card game Poker/Poker Dice. The Cuban game however is unique!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are five Dice in the traditional Cubilete set. Each dice has six sides, and each side has one of the following characters on it: Ace, King, Queen (also known as &amp;quot;Cundangas&amp;quot;), Jack (Jevas, or Mujeres), 10 (Los Gallegos), 9 (Los Negros).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of the game is to roll five dice of the same kind. A hand with less than five of a kind has absolutely no value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win a round, you need to get the highest hand. The winner of each round (and only the winner) wins points based on the value of their hand. A game is played to a total score of 10 patas (points). Whoever gets 10 points first wins the game, even if all of the players have not had a turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ultimate goal of the game is to score &amp;quot;Carabinas.&amp;quot; If you roll any Carabina during the game you immediately win the round and get to keep rolling for another round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are three types of Carabina, listed in order of value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Carabina de Aces -- is worth ten points and is very difficult to obtain. To get Carabina de Aces, you need to get a complete set of five aces within the three-roll limit. If you get Carabina de Aces, you are awarded 10 points. The game is over. You have eliminated everyone else in the game. You are the winner of the game, even if no one else had a chance to roll! If you get Carabina de Aces, then you are always the first roller in the next game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Carabina de Ks (Kings) Naturales -- you need to have five Kings within your three allotted rolls. If you get this type of Carabina, you get five points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Carabina de Ks (Kings) No Naturales -- the only way to obtain this is by pairing the Aces with the Kings. (The Ace can be paired with any of the other dice because it is wild.) If you obtain this type of carabina, you get two points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If nobody gets a Carabina after everyone has had their turn, one point is awarded to the person with the highest hand:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;middot; Five Queens&amp;#10;&amp;middot; Five Jevas (Jacks)&amp;#10;&amp;middot; Five Gallegos&amp;#10;&amp;middot; Five Negros&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The strategy in Cubilete is knowing what to play for and when, depending on what your opponents score. Obviously, luck is the dominant factor. Cubilete is often played as a drinking game, with several scoring variations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
