						               													<description>Frank Buck was a well-known big game trapper who wrote a 1930 book, Bring 'Em Back Alive. In this game there are twelve books of three cards. Each book represents an animal that Fran Buck has brought back alive from the jungles or a scene illustrating adventures on his expeditions. The books are made by fitting the three cards together in the proper way to form a complete picture. The  center card of each book has the name of the book at the top and a red number. The other two cards of each book have some descriptive or leading phrase that gives a clue to its proper book without revealing the name.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players draw a card to determine the dealer. The higher number deals. Players are dealt three cards face up. The remaining cards are placed face down in the center. The dealer plays first. He looks over all the cards to determine whether or not a book may be made up from the cards showing. If  the dealed can make up a book, he selects the proper cards and places them in front of him. His turn is complete and play passes to the player on his left. If the dealer can not make up a book, he draws one card from the top of the center pile and tries to make up a book. If successful, he places the book in front of him. If unsuccessful in making up a book, the card drawn is discarded face up.  In either case his turn ends and play passes to the left. The player to the left then has the same option as the dealer plus he may use the card which has been discarded. The following general rules apply. A player may get only one book in a turn. After the three original cards a player does not replace any cards which may be drawn from his hand. If a player discards the third card of any book (not realizing that it made a book), any other player may call the name of the animal and pick up the book with out interfering with his turn. When the cards in the pack have all been drawn the discard pile is turned over and used again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
