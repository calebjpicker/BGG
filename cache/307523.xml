						               													<description>Esprit de Corps: A House Divided gives you the authentic challenge and drama of battle in the Civil War between the States.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Fast action games at every level - brigade, division, corps or multi-corps&amp;#10;     Figures based in multiples as elements - no need to re-base your troops&amp;#10;     Summary Starter Rules - get fighting fast&amp;#10;     Full explanation in detailed Main Rules&amp;#10;     Numerous worked examples of how the rules work - abundant explanatory diagrams too&amp;#10;     Complete example battle account - Kernstown 1862 re-fought&amp;#10;     Ready access - cross referenced and indexed throughout&amp;#10;     Essentially simple D6 based rules systems - common with others in the Esprit de Corps Series - play one play them all&amp;#10;     Alternate movement - facilitates play&amp;#10;     Fully functioning chain of command from the C-in-C to unit CO&amp;#10;     Command &amp;amp; control - recreates the difficulties and frustrations of command on the ACW battlefield&amp;#10;     Comprehensive coverage of combat formations and weaponry&amp;#10;     Detailed and carefully calibrated troop classification - accurately recreate the characteristics of the units and soldiers at each stage in the War&amp;#10;     Generic army lists and guidelines on how to create your miniature armies&amp;#10;     Authentic historical accuracy - the unique character of the American Civil War recreated&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Detailed Army Lists and Scenarios to follow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These rules, like those already published (Esprit de Corps for the period 1790 to 1860), have been carefully designed to incorporate a sophisticated series of integrated checks and balances to give a really good game and complete historical authenticity. Command and control and rapid manoeuvre are right at the centre of things. As a result there's quite a lot to get to grips with in this rulebook, but don't worry, the rule systems and mechanisms are basically simple and quick to use.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are all about command and control, the absolute core of the Esprit de Corps system. You have to prompt your troops into action and at times restrain them from recklessly forgetting their orders. It enables the opposing sides to move alternately while retaining the potential for each to outmanoeuvre the other and for tactical surprise on the battlefield. As the action develops you will find more and more demands falling on your generals, drawing on their reserves of command and control. If the latter run out, your army will rapidly disintegrate and suffer defeat. Movement is rapid, each move representing from 10 to 15 minutes of action on the battlefield, and though ranges are significant, there is still plenty of scope for the use of manoeuvre to outplay your opponent, especially if your terrain is thoughtfully designed to accurately recreate that in the real theatre of operations you are depicting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The systems for shooting, monitoring morale and determining the outcomes of attacks, melees and pursuits are simple, internally consistent and robust, so that they quick to resolve yet give an outcome which is appropriate and sensitive to the tactical situation, and, importantly, historically authentic. Normal (D6) dice are used for all transactions involving a random element (a die roll) throughout the rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
