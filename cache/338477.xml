						               													<description>A 2 player game of love and time travel...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You have lived a life of time distorted. The days you live are not in chronological order. One day you might be 5 years old, learning to tie your shoe for the first time. You sleep, and awake the next day as a young adult, at a job you suddenly know (or remember?) how to do.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It&amp;rsquo;s exciting! Never a dull moment, every sensation feels fresh and new. You get to experience firsts again and again. There is no such thing as monotony.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But recently, your days have all had one thing in common. One person is always there. Even though you are living your relationship out of order, it is clear that you will love this person dearly (or perhaps you already do).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For the first time, you feel a desire to change this time-hopping life of yours and live linearly. You want to experience life with this person, to build and share the same memories together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So now begins a conscious choice. You have to stabilize, to break free of the chaotic whirlpool of time you have found yourself tossed about it, and find calmer waters. You&amp;rsquo;re not even sure if it&amp;rsquo;s possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As you drag yourself towards a linear timeline, you can feel it take a toll on your body and mind. You&amp;rsquo;ve never lived time in order before, can you even handle it?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So many questions, so many unknowns. But what you do know is that you have to try, you really, really want to try. And you can sense that they do too.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play this game when you want to feel very soft, share emotional intimacy, and maybe cry a little.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Playing the game&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     On your first turn, flip the card your token is already on face up&amp;#10;     On subsequent turns, move your token to an adjacent (not&amp;#10;     Read the prompt that corresponds to your card, answering the questions it poses&amp;#10;     Note down any affects on your Time Sickness. Some cards will give you Time Sickness, others will heal it. &amp;#10;     The aim of the game is for both players to move their tokens to the Joker card, stabilizing themselves and gaining the ability to live time linearly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
