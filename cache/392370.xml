						               													<description>Liars &amp;amp; Looters is a fun and quick game where you trade resource cards and outsmart your opponents with strategic deceit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you enjoy games like COUP, Chocobo Crystal Hunt and Werewolf this game is definitely for you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3-6 Players embrace their inner trickster while searching for the resource cards their chosen TRIBE is gathering. Only by collecting all of them FIRST you can win and prove your superior skills in bluffing and spotting a liar.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your TRIBE CARD will show you what to hunt for, and what to dismiss as unusable -&amp;#10;but keep in mind, everyone can see your TRIBE CARD and knows exactly with which resources they can bait you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;By drawing from the DECK each turn, more RESOURCE CARDS come into play OR a special EVENT will be triggered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your main focus should lie on the TRADES where 1 Player offers a card FACE DOWN, while everyone else is competing &amp;ndash;also cards faced down- in the trade to get OR NOT get the offered card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The TRADES and their results are your chance to lie your ass off or be honest while acting guilty. You are allowed to claim anything as &amp;bdquo;truth &amp;ldquo;, but NEVER to REVEAL your cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Read the room. &amp;#10;Catch the tiniest grin. &amp;#10;Try to remember what cards you traded with whom-&amp;#10;Then you&amp;acute;ll be unstoppable in this GAME OF WITS and DECEITE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
