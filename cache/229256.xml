						               													<description>A card game based on the Doom Video Games for 2+ players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common deck comprising 6 card types: &amp;#10;Action, Weapon, Equipment, Location, Zombie and Demon.  &amp;#10;Action, Weapon and Equipment cards are collectively called Aid cards.  &amp;#10;Zombie and Demon cards are collectively known as foes. All foes have damage and strength ratings. They may also have traits that will interact with other cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Counters are used to keep track of Life Points, Doom Points and Ammunition. Each player starts with 19 + 1D6 Life Points and  2D6 Doom Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played over a series of turns with each turn comprising 6 phases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.   Doom Phase&amp;#10;-     Lay out 3X cards where X is the number of players.  These are the doom cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.   Leader Phase&amp;#10;-     Determine the leader for this phase. The player with the least life is the leader. If tied for least life, the player with the least Doom Points goes first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3.   Tactics Phase&amp;#10;-     Starting with the Leader, and going clockwise, each player picks 1 of the doom cards laid out in Doom Phase. If it is an Aid card place it in front of yourself. If it is a Foe card place it in front of an opponent. If it is a Location card, place it in front of yourself or an opponent. If a player gets a Location card, he must discard any other location card he may already have in play. &amp;#10;-    Continue going around until all doom cards are assigned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4.   Resolution Phase&amp;#10;-     Start with the leader and go clockwise. &amp;#10;-     Each location has a foe limit. The player discards foes in front of him in excess of the foe limit. &amp;#10;-     Discard 1 or more ammo tokens, equipment, and action cards to defeat a foe with a strength equal to less than the force of the cards discarded. &amp;#10;-    Gain Doom Points equal to the damage rating of defeated foes. Discard defeated foes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5.   Damage Phase&amp;#10;-     Each foe in front of you does damage to you equal to its damage rating (damage received corresponds to an equal loss of life points)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6.   End Phase&amp;#10;-     At end of turn a player may have a max of 6 aid cards in front of him.  Discard excess. &amp;#10;-    If you did not take damage in damage phase, heal 2 life points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to gain 50+ Doom Points and to have killed at least 1 Boss is the winner.  Lose all your life points and you are out of the game. If only one player remains, he wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
