						               													<description>From the box/intro:  The object of the game is to accumulate the most wealth by selecting and acting like one of the six images. You can wheel and deal with other players, invest money, and enter Bonus to reach higher levels of play. Remember, everything in the game is negotiable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We have taken six of the most powerful symbols known to man and made them my principal characters. They represent man&amp;rsquo;s ultimate choices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Eagle &amp;ndash; Strength through individual freedom as we soar to new heights of achievement.&amp;#10;Fire &amp;ndash; Since the beginning of time man has nurtured its eternal flame.&amp;#10;Demon &amp;ndash; A symbol of corrupted power waiting in the darkness to feed on the weak and helpless.&amp;#10;Throne &amp;ndash; Rules of wealth dominate for themselves vast empires of property and people.&amp;#10;Serpent &amp;ndash; In the garden was a serpent coiled and waiting to misguide and misdirect.&amp;#10;Cross &amp;ndash; A universal symbol of good, we can always depend on the kindness of others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is the relationship between people&amp;rsquo;s morals, money, and their different goals that cause conflict and change.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We introduce The Ultimate Game. For the first time you can experience fantasy and reality with the imagination of role playing and the strategy of a board game. You can make the game come to life. The rules should guide, but not limit you. Welcome to our world. A new dimension of game playing awaits you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;--&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Played on a fully painted board, a fantasy-induced image becomes the actual playing board. The game is started as pawns, much like in life. Movement is made by standard two 6d rolls. There are various hazards and events on the board and penalties and bonuses are paid in cash or movement limitations. Along the game path, there are six home bases of the various character images. A pawn can enter any one of his choosing and assume that character for the rest of the game. Character images may not harass pawns in any way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At this point a player assumes his character image role and each player has different powers and functions. Primary functions include: Eagle receives a cash commission for ALL financial transactions in the game, Fire  sweeps  and moves players about the board, Demon harasses players and blocks them from advancing, Throne buys properties and investments that increase each round, Serpent harasses and robs players, and Cross saves players from being robbed, harassed, or burned (moved against their will) by Fire. There are dozens of specific other roles, functions and actions that each character may do, and image characters add a &amp;ldquo;magic red&amp;rdquo; die to their roles that also allows them to perform custom functions and actions, as well as common actions to all characters in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most money/property at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
