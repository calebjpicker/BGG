						               													<description>King Tea has infiltrated the Realm of Time. Help Cup Joe and his Coffee Time friends stop King Tea from making it Tea Time permanently across the 5 Worlds; or sound the trumpets and join the crumpets (King Tea&amp;rsquo;s mindless minions of mayhem). &amp;quot;The fate of the 5 Worlds hangs in the balance as you decide whether to side with Cup Joe and or King.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Choose to play as one of four Coffee Time Heroes: Cup Joe, Thermos, Little Miss Hot Shot, or Donette. Or, join the crumpets and play as one of two villains: King Tea or the zombie crumpet named Roamer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Coffee Time is an introduction to strategy games for 2-6 players and ages 8+. Players take turns following the instructions on their unique player cards. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Heroes, begin by using or trading item cards, then they move forward toward the activation chamber by rolling dice. At the end of each move heroes draw from the Journey Deck where they can be launched into a battle, suffer at the hands of the Duchess or gather valuable items.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roamer tries to knock heroes back to start and prevent them from reaching the Realm of Time, and steals valuable item cards from heroes. King Tea spends his turns changing the World Clocks and sending out his royal guards to thwart the heroes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Heroes make their way to the Realm of Time to try to defeat royal guards and King Tea. If they can successfully defeat all 5 guards and King Tea, then the heroes win the game. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Roamer and King Tea have extremely powerful cards that they can utilize strategically, once per game, to thwart the heroes or turn the World Clocks more quickly. If the tea characters change all 5 World Clocks to Tea Time, then the villains win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Coffee Time is a fast-paced game that takes under an hour to play. Coffee Time is brewed espresso-ly for families and friends with fun infused into every detail.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
