						               													<description>Grexit is a card driven competitive game in which up to 4 creditor countries (USA, Germany, Russia and China) vie for contol over the valuable resources of the debtor country (Greece) through economic pressure and by enforcing policies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Creditor country has it's own special ability that affects it's balance in the game, while the Debtor country draws a &amp;quot;political party&amp;quot; card to determine what kind of government is in power (left, center or right, each with it's own special ability). All the players draw a hidden objective card which will give them their own personal agenda to fullfill. These agendas will most of the time lead to conflict of interest between the players. Objectives can be for example: to control the most of one kind of resource (eg. oil deposits, natural gas), to own public utilities or services of general interest (eg. Power, Water or Telecommunications) or to save the country (preventing the country from either falling apart in revolt or declaring bankruptcy) or ruining the country (to end the game before the 8th turn).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game begins with each player drawing hidden objective cards&amp;#10;Each turn, an event card is drawn, which will give flavor to the game as well as affect the policies and actions taken during that turn. &amp;#10;Then, the players controlling the creditor countries, draw cards from the &amp;quot;Memorandum&amp;quot; deck and choose which policies they'd like to have adopted by the debtor country. In order to entice the Debtor, they offer the policies face down with a bribe card face up. Bribes can be either money or relief measures which give victory points and breathing space respectively to the Debtor player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a general rule, in order for the creditor player to earn victory points, he needs to control properties and to fullfill their hidden objectives to win the game, while any debt owed to him by the debtor player by the end of the game will be lost. On the other hand, the debtor player earns victory points from the bribes accepted, from the properties that remain public, from the happiness of his people (if any) and from the level of the debt (if he hasn't declared bankruptcy).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
