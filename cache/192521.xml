						               													<description>In Devil Tree Station: Skin That Smokewagon! each player takes the role of either a Wanted gang outlaw or justice fueled Posse member in a lead filled shootout in the dirt covered streets of the Wild West town of Devil Tree Station. Out think your adversaries through decisive actions and straight shooting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player selects a character card to portray them, either a Posse Member or Wanted Outlaw and teams emerge The Posse and the Wanted Outlaws. Each team has a four card action deck from which each player on the team selects an action to play each turn. Also of interest is each character has a action card that if played by them allows them to reroll any or all of their action dice once. This is their &amp;quot;tell&amp;quot; as the other side sees this as well. Will you follow you tell and risk the other team playing an opposing card or do you avoid it and surprise them but forfeit the chance to reroll. If the other team plays the correct corresponding action they steal half of your action dice, so the risk and rewards are very real.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player plays an Action Card face down and places some or all of their dice on the action Card becoming their Action Dice...the remainder goes on the Character Card. Play then proceeds from fewest Action Dice to most...there's the fast and the dead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Active Player flips over their Action Card while designating a target on the other team who flips over their card. If the Active Players Action Card counteracts the Targets, the Acting player immediately steals half the Target's Action Dice and places them on their Character card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next the Active player rolls their Action Dice looking for icons that match their Action Card. For example, if they played the Cover Action they look for Cover icons on the dice. Each rolled die that matches the Action card allows the Active Player to move one of the Target's Action Dice to the Active Players Character card. Then the next lowest number of Action Dice goes and so on...Last Team of Player with dice remaining wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The real beauty of this game is that it can be played as either an every player for themselves free-for-all or as a team based battle fighting for dominance of the town. Each version of the game supports up to four players, but feel free to combine two games to have up to eight players fight for supremacy!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
