						               													<description>Valley of Tears is a Battalion Combat Series game depicting the entire 1973 Yom Kippur war from 6 Oct 73 until the ceasefire enforced by the Superpowers and the UN. As the culmination of over 20 years of research in consultation with world-class experts, Valley of Tears shows the Yom Kippur war at a level of detail not yet seen. For the first time ever, for example, the game&amp;rsquo;s maps were precisely drawn using actual tactical Israeli maps used during the war and include the official code names for hilly defensive positions in both battle areas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Valley of Tears takes the BCS into a whole new level: that of post WW2 operations. For example, its dedicated air warfare system allows BCS players to not only pit F-4 Phantoms against MiG-21 Fishbeds in the contest for air superiority, but also assign the Front&amp;rsquo;s air units to execute SEAD and Deep Strike (both RAM and DOMINQUE) missions (to suppress the ever present SAM threat and attack enemy air bases/destroy enemy infrastructure, respectively) as well as the traditional (but more effective) BCS Close Air Support missions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game presents the largest tank battle since WWII, with the Cold War adversaries fighting a proxy war where the latest Centurion and Patton tanks faced off against T-62s following Soviet tactical doctrines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expecting to have to repeat the war&amp;rsquo;s of 1967 and 1956, the Israelis were confronted by the then-new and unexpected masses of Sagger missiles and RPG hand-held weapons. It&amp;rsquo;s your job to win the war, with or against, these new weapons and the much more effective and versatile air war to generate a win without taking excessive casualties making the win Pyrrhic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you master the deadly environment and become the victor?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scenarios:&amp;#10;The Yom Kippur War: Two Front Campaign (All 4 maps)&amp;#10;On the Banks of the Suez: The Sinai Front Campaign (3 maps)&amp;#10;Syrians at the Border: Golan Front Campaign (1 map)&amp;#10;Dual for the Golan (1 map)&amp;#10;Iraqi Intervention (1 map)&amp;#10;Aryeh Dov (1 map)&amp;#10;Operation Stouthearted Men (less than 1 map)&amp;#10;Africa (2 maps)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;BCS rulebook (v2.0, in full color)&amp;#10;Two BCS Charts and Tables (v2.0, in full color)&amp;#10;BCS Support rulebook (v2.0, in full color)&amp;#10;VoT Game Specific rulebook&amp;#10;Israeli Player Booklet&amp;#10;Arab Player Booklet&amp;#10;Turn Record Track Card&amp;#10;Israeli Player Display Card&amp;#10;Arab Player Display Card&amp;#10;Two Frontal Air Display Cards&amp;#10;Four 22&amp;rdquo; x 34&amp;rdquo; Full Color Game Maps (Three Sinai, One Golan)&amp;#10;1,400 Counters (Three unit sheets and Two BCS marker sheets)&amp;#10;8 scenarios total, 4 one-map (or smaller) scenarios of 2 to 5 turns.&amp;#10;Box and Dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
