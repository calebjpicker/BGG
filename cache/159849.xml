						               													<description>Cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are twelve icons, each with a different point value. Each six-sided card has either two different sets of three identical icons (ie: 3 Fire icons and 3 Beaker icons), or has one set of identical icons (ie: 6 Beaker icons), known as a hextuple. (Hextuple? We made up this word. Think of a &amp;quot;double&amp;quot; in dominoes.) The value of each card is the sum of the values of each icon and is displayed in the center of each card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hextuples&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A hextuple is a card where all the icons are the same. There is a hextuple for every icon. Every round of the game is started by placing a hextuple in the center of the playing surface. You can play just one round, or you can play multiple rounds, starting with a different hextuple each time. Choose it before distributing cards to the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you play a hextuple during your turn, you can play another card during your turn to match it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During your turn, you play one card from your inventory by matching icons with one or more cards already played. Your score is the value of your card plus the value of the cards you matched.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Replenish&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You must always have ten cards in your inventory. You can keep your inventory in your hand or just place them in front of you on the playing surface. After you play a card, you replenish your inventory by drawing a card from the pile. If you play a hextuple and are able to match it with another card from your inventory, you draw two cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jokers&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jokers are wild. They can match any icon and each of the three Joker hextuples can be used to match six cards at once. They have no point value when played, but make sure you play them, because their value switches to 100 points and count against your score if left in your inventory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending Rounds&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Keep playing until all the cards in the pile are drawn. Then play until someone has played all their cards or until no other play can be made. Each player then adds up the card values left in their inventory and subtracts the sum from their score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ending Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you play multiple rounds, you can add the scores from each round to determine the winner. Or, you can treat each round separately and award a point to the player with the highest score for each round, and the winner is the player who won the most rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
