						               													<description>You have a full day ahead of you. It's going to be just you, the lake, and a bunch of fish-like creatures waiting to join you on your journey for the most relaxing day ever. Day on the Lake is a light dexterity game that has you throwing a die in a lake print-and-play arena, catching fish, earning money, and upgrading your equipment. Will you be an angler champion this day on the lake?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Roll a die and check the fish you caught. If you passed the criteria for success then you gain money. Try and collect the most money from different shaped fish in ten turns. If you have extra money you can upgrade your die, giving you much better odds at fishing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
