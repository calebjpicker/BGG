						               													<description>In AARU players take on the role of one of the great and powerful Egyptian deities trying to draw worthy souls to their particular celestial palace in the Field of Reeds. To gather souls the gods play a game called AARU. Souls are won by winning tricks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The souls of the Pharaohs are the most sought after by the gods. To win a Pharaohs soul you must deduce the value of one hidden card you own! Every time a player plays a card that could have been the Pharaoh card the opponents shout AARU!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;AARU is a trick-taking deduction game for 2 to 4 players aged 8+. Each game takes 15 to 30 minutes to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME OVERVIEW&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A game of AARU is played over 3 rounds and points are scored by winning tricks and by deducing and playing your Pharaoh card at the right time! Points can be lost if a Pharaoh is played incorrectly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each round the players are dealt a hand of cards. All players pick a Pharaoh for the opponent to their left and add it to the opponents hand facing away from them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In turn, players play a card from their hands with the highest value of the leading type played winning unless a Power card has beaten it. The twist is that in AARU whenever a player could have played their Pharaoh card (the one that faces away from them) the other Players say AARU to them to indicate they missed the chance of playing their Pharaoh. This way they can eventually deduce when is the best time to play their Pharaoh card for bonus points!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are totaled for each of the three rounds with the winner being declared by having the most points at the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
