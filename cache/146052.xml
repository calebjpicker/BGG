There's even a Novel Length Storyline planned!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;About the Game Structure&amp;#10;There are 121 different game cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players design and build a single deck made up of a certain number of cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Card Types&amp;#10;Nightmare doesn't have &amp;quot;spells&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;creatures&amp;quot;, it features Phobias, Entities, Delusions, Doubts, Uncertainties, Guilts, Synaptic Misfires, Paranoia's, and Entropies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Overview&amp;#10;At the beginning of a game, players shuffle their decks (called &amp;ldquo;Mind&amp;rdquo;) thoroughly and draw cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players decide who goes first, by random selection.Each player may place one Delusion per turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play progresses through turns and stages until one player loses their all of their Lucidity, thus losing the game or achieves 100 Lucidity. If there are more than 2 players, the last player still holding on to some Lucidity is the winner and buys their sanity with the souls of their opponents or achieves 100 Lucidity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is just the surface. Players will have to contend with Madness, Repression, and Regression in their struggle to escape their Nightmare.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
