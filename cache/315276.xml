						               													<description>Lucha Wars is a two to eight-player dice game, based on the popular world of professional Mexican wrestling, or &amp;quot;Lucha Libre&amp;quot; (a.k.a. free fighting). The game is a new variation with new content to Luchador! Mexican Wrestling dice. &amp;#10;Each player selects a Luchador wrestling character to play and rolls their Grapple Dice to try to either reduce their opponent/s life points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a &amp;quot;count of three&amp;quot; to win by a pin.&amp;#10;Each wrestler has individual Life levels, Pinnable level, and Combo Attack zones. Also, they each have their own Special Attacks that can be used during a match by rolling their Special Attack Die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players begin by each rolling their own set of five 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. The results of HITs, DODGES, and MISS rolled are played off against each other with DODGES being re-rolled once which can also be used to target their opponent/s dice. The player with the highest Hits is the winner for that round and the loser takes the difference in damage off their Life track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, the winner records the victory by moving their counter up one tile on their Special Attack Track. &amp;#10;The Special Attack track allows a player to do their Special Attack, attempt to PIN an opponent, attack using the Combo Die and attack with a Weapon (Weapons Match).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player has reached the PIN tile on their Special Attack Track, the 'three count' begins against their opponent. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using four of their five wrestling dice or lose the match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In a tag-team match, players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them... if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Weapons match, four Weapons Tokens are placed face-down in each of the four corners of the wrestling ring. Once a player moves their token to the tile on their Special Attack Track that shows a Weapon, it allows them to take a random Weapon Token and use that Weapon against an opponent at the beginning of any new round. This will often involve dexterity rolls with dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Ladder match is a two-player game about which player gets their wrestler standee to the top of the ladder first to win the match. The game also includes a Changing Alliances match and Cage Match rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
