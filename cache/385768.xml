						               													<description>The SAS rugby team the Tigers play against their arch-rival: the Pitbulls! It is the last match of the season, the final that will determine the winner. But the Pitbulls are playing dirty. To make sure they will win, they have Vince and his friends locked in the school. Choose your favourite #LikeMe character to play. Help get Vince to the match in time for the Tigers to win the final! But beware, the Pitbulls have left traps and their mascot is lurking to slow you down. A race against time! Will you manage to escape in time?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a cooperative party game. So you work together to win. Thanks to the different combinations of game cards and the game board which is different every game, this Escape Game is infinitely replayable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
