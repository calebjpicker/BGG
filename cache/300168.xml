						               													<description>The Rising Storm&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The representatives of a local preservation society from a world within the sector, called Heaven's Gate, have been working with the governments of Earth for the last two decades. These representatives have helped scientists from around the globe in understanding the very advanced technologies of the Synod of Worlds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a result, the overall level of technology for the planet has jumped far ahead of what was predicted and the Earth is on the cusp of a new era of exploration and war. Planetary and orbital defenses have been manufactured non stop since the Prometheus Revelation. Planetary Defense Forts are littered around the globe on volcanic islands and barren mountain ranges in order to minimized collateral damage. Armies of powered armor, tanks and mecha fighting vehicles have been rolling off of the production lines and the men and women who will pilot them trained relentlessly in thier use. New tactics and weapons have been developed and the beginnings of a space navy are taking shape.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The preservation societies cannot provide warships to the Terrans but only old and frail cargo haulers of various sizes. Many of these have been put to use building a naval shipyard in the asteroid belt. The first of many warships are not due to for completion for many months and even more months for shakedown and training of its crews. The rest of the second hand frieghters are being hastily converted, with some advisor's assistance, into heavily armed Q-ships and commerce raiders. A half dozen bulk frieghters are being converted into military transport ships and one enormous bulk goods ship into a fleet carrier capable fo carrying squadrons of drone fighters. The first Operation of this new fleet would be to establish a base in the nearby system of Alpha Centauri.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Alpha Centauri system lies on the main trade route and shipping lane through the sector. It is one of the many links in the jump chain between the Jump Gate worlds of Heavan's Gate and Lion's Gate. Jump sensors will be placed around the main jumps points and a ground base will be placed on the only habitable world in the system, Alpha Centauri 3a, nicknamed Plymouth Rock by the predominately American ground forces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Alpha Centauri Campaign uses a Logistics Point and Intelligence Point system to represent the Tail of the military force you are commanding on the table-top and to give you a real sense of growing or depleting resources with each victory or loss. Intelligence Points earned represent the ebb and flow of information on the battlefield. In order to play another scenario you must spend Logistics and/or Intelligence points as you attempt to find, fix and destroy your enemy.  It is fairly simple and uncomplicated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The campaign is compatible with the Full Thrust, Stargrunt II and Dirtside II rules systems available for free from Ground Zero Games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
