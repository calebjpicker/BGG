						               													<description>Subtitled &amp;quot;The Chameleon of Games&amp;quot;, this is a game system for playing any of the 11 different games for which rules are supplied. Introduction text:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The Games of GODZ is a unique and highly versatile game tool rather than a game in itself... the board is interpreted or subdivided in four different ways to allow the employment of different mathematical systems. Virtually all strategy game sin existence employ some method of mathematical logic thereby making it apparent &amp;quot;the Games of GODZ&amp;quot; is capable of utilizing many systems as the basis for a vast number of games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The blocks are generally considered to be people and are therefore colored according to the four major races of the world. A block has an opening in one of its faces. This is used to indicate masculinity or femininity, depending on how it is placed on the board.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;General rules explain different moves (where units move a number of squares equal to their value), &amp;quot;trick moves&amp;quot; (where units combine, merge, split, switch or piggyback), takes (capturing or converting the enemy), etc.. Specific rules tell which areas of the board are in play and what moves or takes are allowed. A deck of cards is used with some of the games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some games are mainly &amp;quot;movement&amp;quot; games, where the players have to move pieces into enemy or objective spaces, while others are &amp;quot;capture&amp;quot; games, where player have to kill all or specific enemy pieces. An interesting game in the set is &amp;quot;Cry&amp;quot;, specifically for three players. One player plays with two other players, who are playing a different game, to score points by thwarting captures by either player - in effect, becoming a peacekeeper.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game components:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- one board of 144 squares, divided into many colors and associations.&amp;#10;- 124 plastic blocks: 4 sets of 31 blocks each in red, white, yellow and black. Each set is made up of 16 &amp;quot;ones&amp;quot; (blocks are 1 cubic unit or 1x1x1), 8 &amp;quot;twos&amp;quot; (1x1x2), 4 &amp;quot;fours&amp;quot; (2x2x1), 2 &amp;quot;eights&amp;quot; (2x2x2) and 1 &amp;quot;sixteen&amp;quot; (2x2x4).&amp;#10;144 playing cards: 4 sets of 36 cards each marked in the same colors as the blocks (but not actually so colored) and with an associated letter (G for Brown, O for Red, D for White, and Z for Yellow). Cards are present in the same numbers as with the blocks, with five spares added to make 36 in a set.&amp;#10;- one booklet of 14 pages of general rules and specific rules, as well as rules on how to play Chess and Checkers with the game set.&amp;#10;- one sheet of directions on how to set up the first of the 11 games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
