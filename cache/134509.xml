						               													<description>This four-player post apocalyptic board game leads gamers on the journey with Kai, making decisions that could impact the survival of the human race. In the aftermath of the apocalypse, survivors were forced to make decisions about how to rebuild our society.  After Time: Survival follows the adventures of Kai, one of the lucky few who escaped from the crumbling civilization.  But Kai's journey was not without its struggles, as he finds himself without a family, caring for a little girl who had lost hers as well, and is expected to lead a group of survivors in the rebuilding process.  Faced with widespread hunger, dangerous weather conditions, and the dark temptations of personal greed, Kai's wits will be tested as he leads his group to a better life.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board has a simple roll and move mechanic but when the players land on a &amp;quot;running Kai&amp;quot; space they draw a &amp;quot;Survival&amp;quot; card. On the card is a piece of the story that has an encounter that has two choices. The Player reads the card and then must choose an option and then turn the card over to see if they have earned community points or resource points. As they move around the board they might be hit by storms. The storms will set them back if they have no shelter token. Shelter tokens are earned when the player builds a community house.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players compete as they race to amass resource points to build their own houses; but then the game takes a turn when they have to cooperate and negotiate with each other to spend and/or pool their community points to build community houses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner of the game is the person who has been helpful enough to get all of the community houses built but has also balanced their own needs and has completed building their own five individual houses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
