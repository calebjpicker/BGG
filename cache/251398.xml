						               													<description>Introduction:&amp;#10;Quest for Esmeralda is a strategy-based, Simultaneous Action Selection battle game with medieval theme. Players each take a role as an adventurer on a quest to retrieve the treasure called Esmeralda. It&amp;rsquo;s every man for himself, and players must defeat everyone else before reaching Esmeralda. However, Esmeralda is heavily guarded by the Dragon... How will you defeat all opponents, slain the Dragon and retrieve Esmeralda?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;Each player is dealt a hand from a small deck of 12 cards. The deck is designed to be exhaustive, and players can deduce what other players have, based on what's been played.&amp;#10;Players battle each other in multiple Battles, each consisting of Turns. &amp;#10;At the beginning of every Turn, each player secretly chooses an action and their target. All cards are revealed at once, and the actions are resolved accordingly. If you accumulate enough damage, you are out for that Battle and cannot join until the next Battle. Don't worry, Battles typically only last 3 Turns.&amp;#10;After every turn, surviving players get to move their pawn down the world map towards Esmeralda. Each point on the map, however, has a location card which may be beneficial or detrimental to the players. The last point on the world map is Esmeralda, defended by the Dragon. When fighting the Dragon, his health never heals. This means that sneaky players can swoop in and deal the last hit to win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Frequently Asked Questions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Is this a player elimination game?&amp;#10;Yes, however the elimination is temporary. Players always come back to life after every Battle. It's no fun when players get eliminated and they have to sit around for the rest of the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Will it be hard for losing players to win the game?&amp;#10;Nope! The game is designed for quick battles with balancing mechanisms everywhere.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What will I need to play the PnP version?&amp;#10;You will need 4 pairs of matching pawns, and 1 unique pawn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
