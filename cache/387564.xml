						               													<description>Your goal in Klink is to have the lowest score possible to win the round. Win enough rounds, and you win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck consists of cards ranging from -5 to 10. On a turn, take two cards from the deck, look at one of them, then decide whether to keep the cards or offer them to another player; if you offer them, that player can look at one card of their choice, then keep the cards, or offer them to someone else. If the final player is being offered the card, they must keep them. Whoever ends up with the cards takes the next turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player has ten cards in front of them, the round ends, and everyone reveals their cards. If you have two cards of the same value, they cancel one another. Whoever has the lowest score wins the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Klink includes special event cards that change the rules of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
