						               													<description>An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The sibling rivalry between you and your brother is legendary. Some ascribe the antagonism to the circumstances of your birth: When the Queen bore identical twins sons many years ago, a careless midwife placed both infants in the same bassinet without identifying the elder, and the rightful heir to the throne has been in doubt ever since. Others believe that your fierce competitiveness is simply a distillation of the belligerence that runs throughout your bloodline. For whatever reason, you have spent your entire life trying to prove your superiority to your brother.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unfortunately, that life is about to end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Four days ago Barbarians attacked from the west. Both you and your brother marshaled your individual forces and followed your father to meet the enemy. At first it seemed the battle would be easily won: for each of your soldiers who fell in battle a score of Marauders were dispatched. But by the third day it became apparent that, while your own forces rapidly dwindled, there would be no end to the Barbarian horde. And this morning your losing battle quickly became a rout: The King was slain, you found yourself surrounded, and the forces controlled by you and your brother were reduced to a mere handful a piece.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, as the Marauders press in, you know that you will soon be sent to your reward. But you don't fear death. In fact, only one thing weighs on your mind: this is your absolute last chance to outdo your brother. And you are certain he is thinking the same thing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object: Each player will attempt to amass more Kills than his opponent before both Princes die in battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Reference cards are also provided but not required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
