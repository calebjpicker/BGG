						               													<description>FAST ATTACK CRAFT RULES FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1950&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A SET OF QUICK REFERENCE SHEETS IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PUBLISHER'S WEBSITE&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are for the recreation of small naval engagements with Fast Attack Craft such as missile boats and smaller warships, mainly in coastal waters. The period covered runs from the late 1950&amp;rsquo;s onwards and allows for the use of aircraft and helicopters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The new 2nd edition of the rules has been updated to incorporate our standard A&amp;amp;AGE initiative system, where play alternates between both sides, with the winner of initiative deciding who will move the first unit each turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To represent the uncertainty of modern warfare units on both sides may start the battle as unidentified &amp;ldquo;blips&amp;rdquo; or Contact Markers. Forces with inferior technology may be forced to deploy their units on table, rather than being &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo;, while superior forces may have more &amp;ldquo;blips&amp;rdquo; than units, making it more difficult for the enemy to detect where the real units are. A Contact Marker may be detected and become a radar contact, though that must be visually identified before it can be attacked. You can only attack (or be attacked) if your unit has been placed on the table as a model.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Movement is regulated by means of a system of speed settings, which reflect the maximum and minimum speeds at which the vessel may move in the current turn. The settings may be changed at the end of the turn to plan next turn&amp;rsquo;s movement, and they may also be altered due to damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Combat system allows for guns and missiles of various types, and resolution is split into a Launch Phase, typically when missiles are fired against enemy targets, and a Combat Phase, where hits by all are resolved and damage inflicted. The subtlety here is that each Phase operates separately, with the order of actions alternating between the players. In the Combat Phase, the active ship does all its direct shooting, but at the end of its actions all incoming missile attacks are resolved against it. Damage it now suffers may mean that any missiles it has launched, and which have not yet been resolved, may become ineffective.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Damage is recorded in a graded system with 5 states from intact to sunk. It is also possible for vessels to suffer Special Damage, which further degrades their ability to function. There are simple rules for operating helicopters from ships, as well as rules for anti-aircraft fire with guns and missiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We have updated the game set up and introduced a simple points value system for players who want a relatively balanced game. There is also now a system of determining victory or defeat, based on the level of damage each force has suffered. This system represents the effect of damage to valuable assets forcing one or even both sides to retire rather than lose ships.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are also additional rules for unconventional craft, mine warfare and operations against coastal targets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They are rounded off with extensive data tables for missiles, torpedoes, guns, rockets, SAM systems, Air to Air missiles, ships, helicopters and aircraft. (There are 140 sets of ship data from over 40 countries).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
