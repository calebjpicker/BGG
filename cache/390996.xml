						               													<description>'Children of the Sun' is a two-player strategy game in which players take on the role of Mesoamerican-inspired deities crafting a fantastical world. Each player is one of the Sun god's two children sent to Earth to create a beautiful landscape as an ode of love from the Sun god to the Moon goddess.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played in turns, with each turn being split into two phases. During the Summoning Phase, players will draw an Elemental Token from a bag. Tokens come in five different Elements: Earth, Water, Life, Void, and Spirit. The token is placed on the main game board and must &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot; a row of opponent pieces, similar to games like Go or Reversi. Tokens are flipped to the player's corresponding side, black or white. Each token that was jumped, along with the token placed, awards the player with Elemental Resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After flipping tokens and gaining resources, the player begins their Creation Phase. During the Creation Phase, the player may use their Elemental Resources to craft Creation Cards, which award the player with various scoring criteria based upon the creation type.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the Creation Phase, the player's turn is over, and the opposing player begins. Gameplay continues until there are only two spaces left on the board, at which point players calculate their scores. The winner of this game is the player that scores the most points and most pleases the moon with their fantastic creations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
