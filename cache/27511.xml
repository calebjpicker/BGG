						               													<description>Second Ediiton Notes&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With the end of the 2nd. world war, the world enters a new political configuration headed by two great blocs: the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite the climate of hope in the division of defeated Germany, a series of suspicions begin to emerge among the old allies. The Russians with control of so-called Eastern Europe awoke among Western allies suspected of a possible breakthrough in 1946.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Americans along with the British began to reposition the bulk of their troops on German frontiers and began a program to ship supplies and ammunition to their units. In 1947 the Russians also began to move in this chess, with the increase of their military personnel in occupied Germany. In 1948 the first course occurs when Stalin&amp;rsquo;s armies block Berlin, barring access to supplies and new troops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The American response comes in two nuclear attacks, one on Moscow with a new American bomb called BlueToddler and another attack on the Soviet heavy industries in the Urals with 3 small tactical bombs known as Nuke Candy. The Russians advance their conventional forces on the allies and a new conflict begins. The allies are now mortal enemies, on the one hand, the Americans, the English, and the French, and on the other hand the Russians and the Chinese, who proclaim themselves communists in 1947, joining the so-called Soviet Federation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 1949 is invented by the Russians the engines of macro combustion enabling the introduction of so-called combat mechs. These armaments recover the ground lost by the Soviets, pushing the allies to the borders of Poland. In 1950 the first Russian nuclear bomb explodes over New York, taking the world war to the American soil! In 1951 the Allies entered with their mechs of combat in Europe, bringing the conflict to unimaginable levels.&amp;#10;In this scenario, a powerful organization arises, formed by old Nazis who dream of having a great Germany again: the Werwolf Korps. Hidden in the Bavarian Alps in deep Nazi fortresses, they emerge as a fighting force with fantastic weapons and black magic. These represent one more weight in the pendulum of history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Luftwaffe 46 is a jet fighter game set in the world of Hotwar, where the war doesn&amp;rsquo;t end in 1945 but continues as Germany launches its other jet plane projects and fights the allies in dogfights. The rules were made for you to play with miniatures in 1/300 scale, in the absence of them, we supply markers to replace them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What you will need to play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 measuring tape&amp;#10;2 six-sided dice (known as d6)&amp;#10;1 smooth surface (a dining room table for example)&amp;#10;Rulebook (you are reading it now)&amp;#10;Paper and pen&amp;#10;Miniatures for 3D printing (STL FILES) - Available for download, links in the end of the rule book&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
