						               													<description>You are priests of Zarot tasked with building Temples. Play your cards to build temples or be a heretic by hoarding them. Keep an eye on the calendar as each discard shortens the time you&amp;rsquo;ll have to score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Zarot players are trying to score the most points by using their cards to form patterns called Temples. Each round a different suit is used to start a Temple. The players with the highest score after 5 rounds wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Discarding is optional, but all discards are placed around a Calendar card in the center of the playing area. Once the calendar is full the round is over so discard carefully.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can also choose to score by being a Heretic. This means you are forsaking your duty to build Temples and simply hoard cards. At the end of the round, If you have no Temple card in their hand or in play, then you may add up the number values from all of your cards and that total is your score for this hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
