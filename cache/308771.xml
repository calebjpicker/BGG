						               													<description>In Dawn of Legends, 2 - 4 players will be recruiting Allies, adding Items and learning Tactics to prove their prowess on the battle field. By winning control of each field, promoting your proven assets and gaining more, players score Victory Points. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of 4 rounds wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, players take turns, taking a single action each turn, until all players have passed or played their whole hand. Then, players resolve each of the 3 Battle Fields, scoring them and gaining their unique win rewards. The game proceeds in this manner for 4 rounds, after which, players will count the Victory Points they have collected from Tokens, cards they have Promoted as well as cards they own (in their Deck, Hand, Plan and Discard).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, take one of these Action:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Prepare Action. Players may discard any card from their hand to put a card from the Market in their Preparation Area (to draw next round).&amp;#10;     Recruit Action. Players may discard 2 cards from their hand to play a card from the Study into their Active Card Slot of their Plan. The Icon(s) on the Recruited card MUST be represented at least once on the 2 cards discarded.&amp;#10;     Play Action. Players may play a single card from their hand into their Active Card Slot.&amp;#10;     Musou Action. Players may (if they still have cards in hand) spend Musou to activate their Legend's unique Musou Ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What makes Dawn of Legends unique is the Plan (Player Board) players play cards to. As Cards are played to it or exit it, they have varying effects. Some cards may have effects while they remain in your Plan, while others may protect your Plan or affect your opponents Plan.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
