						               													<description>Friedland 1807, is a simulation of The Battle of Friedland (June 14, 1807), a major engagement of the Napoleonic Wars between the armies of the French Empire commanded by Napoleon I and the armies of the Russian Empire led by Count von Bennigsen. Napoleon and the French obtained a decisive victory that routed much of the Russian army, which retreated chaotically over the Alle River by the end of the fighting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The engagement at Friedland was a strategic necessity after the Battle of Eylau earlier in 1807 had failed to yield a decisive verdict for either side. The battle began when Bennigsen noticed the seemingly isolated corps of Marshal Lannes at the town of Friedland. Bennigsen, who planned only to secure his march northward to Wehlau and never intended to risk an engagement against Napoleon's numerically-superior forces, thought he had a good chance of destroying these isolated French units and ordered his entire army over the Alle River. Lannes held his ground against determined Russian attacks until Napoleon could bring additional forces onto the field. Bennigsen could have recalled the Russian forces, numbering about 50,000&amp;ndash;60,000 men, and retreated across the river before the arrival of Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s entire army but, being in poor health, decided to stay at Friedland and took no measures to protect his exposed and exhausted army. By late afternoon, the French had amassed a force of 80,000 troops on the battlefield. Relying on superior numbers, Napoleon concluded that the moment had come and ordered a massive assault against the Russian left flank. The sustained French attack pushed back the Russian army and pressed them against the river behind. Unable to withstand the pressure, the Russians broke and started escaping across the Alle, where an unknown number of them died from drowning. The Russian army suffered horrific casualties at Friedland&amp;ndash;losing over 40% of its soldiers on the battlefield&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #151, along with Vittoria.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A page of errata was published in S&amp;amp;T #153.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Turn: approximately 1 hour&amp;#10;Hex: approximately .6km&amp;#10;Units: Brigade&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;One 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color mapsheet&amp;#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&amp;quot; counters, approximately 100 per game)&amp;#10;One 28-page combined Vittoria/Friedland/Napoleonic Battles System rules booklet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Complexity: Medium&amp;#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&amp;#10;Players: 1 or more&amp;#10;Playing Time: 1-2 Hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will have to provide one 6-sided die&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
