						               													<description>Dominus is a tile-laying game where players compete to build the most prestigious medieval monastery. The game features very simple rules, lots of interaction between players (in the form of a shared resource market) and clever tile-laying where players try to match the sides of the tile they are building with the sides of previously built tiles (dominoes style) in order to maximize their score and get access to extra resources. DOMINVS is a fast-paced tile-laying game where a clever placement of your workers on the market will not only grant you access to more resources but may occasionally help you win coins when other players harvest, thus saving you from spending one of your turns harvesting. The market manipulation provides a lot of interaction between players, but not the destructive type of interaction because, even when somebody messes with your plans, new possibilities open in the market for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn, the player places one resource tile together with one of their workers into the market (formed by a 3x3 grid of resource tiles). The tile is either placed on the leftmost space of a row or in the topmost space of a column, thus pushing out one other resource tile from the market that the player then collects. If there is a worker on the expelled tile, it's owner recovers it and gains a Prestige Point. Then the player activates the row or the column of the market where the tile and the worker were placed (each resource tile specifies if activates a column or a row).&amp;#10;When activating a row or a column, the player performs one of two possible actions: harvest or build:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The end game is triggered when a player reaches 50 Prestige points. Then, a final round is played and the player with most Prestige Points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During playtest, 4 player games would take no longer than 30 minutes, making DOMINVS a fast playing game, with an interesting engine building mechanism integrated, with simple rules but with lots of interesting decisions each turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DOMINVS was also designed from the beginning with an integrated and fully functional solo variant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
