						               													<description>The Worriers is a psychological cooperative game in which 1 to 4 players become characters with unique skills.&amp;#10;In this game you have to try on the role of an anxious person, look at the world through their eyes and realize how many challenges stand in their way every day!&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game each player has 3 life tokens (the total amount of points is 12), 3 challenge cards and 3 bonus cards. Superclass cards are postponed until the final stage.&amp;#10;Class cards remain implicated in the challenge deck and drop out to players randomly during the game itself. Also in the game there are goal cards that are in the challenge deck (they come to players during the game). After receiving the goal, you put it in front of you next to the class card.&amp;#10;Each turn, one challenge card should be played with a dice roll. If the number that falls out is greater than the number indicated on the challenge card, then the card is played and can be put away in a discard or folded into a set of goal cards.&amp;#10;On each card, there are symbols in the upper left (bonus cards) or right (challenge cards) corner. On the bonus card - a positive or negative bonus. On the challenge card - the number of bonus cards that must be used to draw the card. If there are still not enough points, then life points are taken away from you according to the number of uncovered points (the total number of bonuses and challenges on the table is 8, 5 fell on the cube, 3 life points would be taken away from you).&amp;#10;Players need to collect the complete set indicated on the goal card. After reaching the specified condition, the player receives a random superclass card, loses health points and continues the game. The game ends when all players have fulfilled the conditions indicated on the goal cards (or by agreement).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
