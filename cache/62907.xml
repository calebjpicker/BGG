						               													<description>Valu, pronounced &amp;lsquo;Var-lu&amp;rsquo; is a Fijian saying &amp;lsquo;to make war&amp;rsquo;. Valu - The Game of Survival is a abstract 2 to 4 player Game of Strategy based on Traditional Pacific island warrior culture.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of Valu is to take all of your opponent&amp;rsquo;s pieces or to create situation where your opponent/s pieces are unable to move and are forced to surrender.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is made up of 96 light green and dark squares (= four islands), 36 light and dark blue squares (= ocean) and 28 light yellow and orange squares (= beach). Opposing pieces (= Clan), red, green, blue and/or yellow are initially lined up on the sides.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has similarities to checkers. All pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture or develop their positions. Capturing occurs when a piece is able to jump over of an opposing piece into an empty space. Capturing is mandatory and jumping/capturing more than one piece on turn is possible. Time between moves is limited and has to be mutually agreed before start of play (1 - 5 minutes). Player must decide the move before touching any of the piece and complete the move immediately. If piece is touched but not moved, it is then sacrificed and removed from the board. Each player has four Chiefs and eight Warrior/Elder pieces. Each type of piece has a slight variation on its form of movement:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Chiefs are the most powerful pieces. They can move both backward and forward and move to any area on the board that is in play. Chiefs are allowed to jump over their own pieces, but only if the square adjacent to it is vacant. When jumping over your own piece the piece remains in play, however if playing in teams the team member&amp;rsquo;s piece being jumped over is sacrificed and removed from board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Warriors can only capture and move in a forward direction. They cannot move onto another island apart from the island it started on or the island directly opposite. Warrior reaching the opposite island is immediately made an Elder (by being turned upside down).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Elders can move forward or backwards and can move to all board areas that are in play. They cannot jump their own pieces or, if playing in a team, they cannot jump their team mate&amp;rsquo;s piece&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Valu can be played as two, three of four with only a minor variation of the rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
