						               													<description>TRIAMAND. Somewhere in a remote desert, an ancient tomb has been disturbed. An evil spirit has woken and is threatening to the whole world with an act of revenge. &amp;#10;  You as a player need to save the world. The world counts on you! You must put bricks back on a tomb. Do it first, and you are the winner!!! &amp;#10;  Game is played by 2 &amp;ndash; 6 people, ages 7+. At the start, each player is given 5 playing cards, for which can be acquired bricks from the Brickbank. The bricks have different shapes and correspond to the color of the card. Amount paid for each brick can be the same as the price or higher. If brick is bought for its stated nominal value, a player can make an additional move. If paid by the nominal, it can be bought as many bricks as laying on the Brickbank (not from the treasury storage). After the player&amp;rsquo;s turn is over, every time empty brick spots on the Brickbank must be covered by new bricks.&amp;#10;  First move on the game is given to the player with highest value card. If several players have similar highest cards, they are comparing their next highest cards until someone has an upper hand.  &amp;#10;  On players turn, can be made one of the following:&amp;#10;-    Card drawn from the stock&amp;#10;-    Brick bought from the Brickbank&amp;#10;-    Brick removed /replaced. * if a row is completed, no brick can be removed or replaced.  &amp;#10;  Seems too easy? Not so fast, my friend. Competition is quite hard, and players need to come up with some strategy in order to succeed. Here are some hurdles: &amp;#10;-    Although some bricks stretch up to the next rows, which is acceptable, player cannot build next row without completely bricklaying preceding one.&amp;#10;-    You have laid almost all bricks and now have stuck for some particular piece: don&amp;rsquo;t have necessary currency to buy this exact brick? Think strategy again: maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t need to cover up row too fast before you acquire necessary resources from the Brickbank. You need to be good at reading patterns. &amp;#10;-    First move always starts from the left bottom corner marked with red. Next moves can be done freely, but within the same row until it is filled and ready to move to the upper one.  &amp;#10; Good luck!!!&amp;#10;  Notice: Game is claimed strategic, and it truly is. In order to win, players must plan their movements in advance. The higher up the pyramid player climbs, the fewer choices one has and has to be very careful. Game is well suitable for school children to develop strategic thinking, to learn better geometrical shapes, and learn to count. Game is fun for adults also and is not burdening with the time required- just about 30 minutes to play one round. Quite addictive: lost players want a replay to get the satisfaction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
