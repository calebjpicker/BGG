						               													<description>From the rules:&amp;#10;Investo is a game of High Finance for three or more players. Play consists of investing In various companies, and receiving from the &amp;quot;INVESTO&amp;quot; Bank, Dividends and Bonuses in accordance with Instructions on a number of cards drawn by the players in rotation. Companies become bankrupt by the drawing of one of the Bankrupt cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TO BEGIN. One of the players is selected as Banker, and issues each of the players with &amp;pound;1,000 with which to make his or her investments; retaining the balance of the money as the &amp;quot;INVESTO&amp;quot; Bank. (The Banker is entitled to join in the game, and should also receive the initial &amp;pound;1,000.) The cards are then shuffled and placed face downwards in the centre of the table. The cards representing the ten companies are shuffled separately and placed face downwards beside the Banker, who is at all times in charge of the game. A number of company cards are then turned face upwards, in front of the Banker; the number so faced being one less than the number of players. (e.g. If five people are playing, then four company cards are turned up.) Players now invest in one or more of the companies as desired. All investments must be in multiples of &amp;pound;100. The Banker keeps a record of all investments.&amp;#10; THE PLAY. The first player (determined by any method desired) then draws the top card and places it face up in front of him. Each card has a number of the top representing one of the companies. If the player drawing the card has invested in that company, he announces the dividend (e.g. No. 4 &amp;mdash;30% or 6/- in the &amp;pound;). The Banker thereupon pays ALL players who have invested in No. 4 company, 30% of their investment, from the money in the Bank. Should the player not have invested in the company whose card is drawn, the play passes to the person next on his left, and so on round the table; each player announcing the dividend or bonus to be paid. ONLY If he has money invested in the company.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BANKRUPTCY. On a player drawing a &amp;quot;BANKRUPT&amp;quot; card for the company in which he has invested, he announces &amp;quot;No. 7 &amp;mdash;Bankrupt&amp;quot;, and then reads the directions as to payment to or from the Bank (e.g. &amp;quot;Shareholders must pay in 10/- for every &amp;pound; invested, to meet the liabilities of the Company.&amp;quot;) or &amp;quot;Shareholders receive 5/- for every &amp;pound; invested in the Company, from the sale of assets,&amp;quot; as the case may be. The Banker then collects the money from, or pays the money to, the shareholders in accordance with the instructions. After all the players have paid or received their money, the Banker removes the bankrupt company from play and exposes the next company card. Any player who had invested in the company that was just bankrupt now has the opportunity to invest in the new company. There is no compulsion, and a player who has money invested in another company may elect not to invest in the new company. On oil investments being completed and recorded by the Banker, play continues with the next player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CHANGE OF INVESTMENT. Changes in investments can only be made when all the cards have been drown. All changes must be recorded by the banker who makes a charge of 10% on the total investment for the issue of the new &amp;quot;Script&amp;quot;. (e.g. a player increases his investment as one of the companies from &amp;pound;200 to &amp;pound;500. The Banker charges &amp;pound;50.). &amp;#10;GENERAL. After all the cards have been drawn, they are re-shuffled, placed face down, and commeacing with the player on the left of the person who drew the last card, play re-commences. When a company is bankrupt and there are no more companies to be exposed, the players who had invested in the last company to go bankrupt may choose any ONE of the remaining companies in which to invest. The game is cancluded when the last company is bankrupt. The winner is the player who finishes the game with the most money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
