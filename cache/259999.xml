						               													<description>Pen and Paper games played with 3 dice, pen and paper. You are the founder of kingdom you can write your kingdoms name to top of paper. you should play at least A4 paper. You are rolling dice for resources each turn 1=Cow 2=People 3=Culture 4=Iron 5=Stone 6=Food you and your opponent keeping paper in front of them without showing to someone. you should write top of the paper side by side soldier, food, farm, people, cow, milk, iron, mine, stone, wall, culture, then roll dice for who will be first, then roll 3 dice.&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;For example you roll 1,3,6 then you should write under of cow 1 under of culture 3 under of food 6, you are starting with 20 food if you run your food because peoples and soldiers eats 1 food per turn your peoples starts to die, you roll a single dice and that much people die. you are gaining resources same as dice number, but if you roll same number at all dices like 111,333...  then you get double of it 333=18 resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are trying to destroy your opponent by soliders, you can create solider with 1 iron and 1 people,you can declare war if you have more than 20 solider , if you decide to attack     then you can see your opponent paper if he has wall your 5 solider dies for per wall then walls demolish, then rest of the your soliders and your opponent solider starts to clash and who has most of the soliders win, if you win and playing more than 2 people you can take all of his resources to your kingdom.&amp;#10;You can build or buy something for improve your kingdom in your turn&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Wall = 25 stone killing 5 soldiers if they attacking&amp;#10;     Soldier = iron+people&amp;#10;     Farm = 15 stone+people producing 1 food per turn&amp;#10;     Mine =20 stone+people producing 1 iron per turn&amp;#10;     You can buy people with 5 food&amp;#10;     You can kill cows for 10 food&amp;#10;     People can drink milk instead of eating food but you cant produce new peoples with milk&amp;#10;     If you have more than 30 culture you can spend 30 culture and roll 3 dice and steal that much solider from your opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;My advice if you are not trusting your opponent you can play open kingdom paper in front of you so no-one can cheat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
