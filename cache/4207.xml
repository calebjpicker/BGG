						               													<description>&amp;quot;Kharkov: The Soviet Spring Offensive 12 May to 21 May 1942&amp;quot;, is a brigade/Division level simulation of the Spring 1942 Soviet strategic offensive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Second Battle of Kharkov or Operation Fredericus was an Axis counter-offensive in the region around Kharkov against the Red Army Izium bridgehead offensive conducted 12&amp;ndash;28 May 1942, on the Eastern Front during World War II. Its objective was to eliminate the Izium bridgehead over Seversky Donets or the &amp;quot;Barvenkovo bulge&amp;quot; which was one of the Soviet offensive's staging areas. After a winter counter-offensive that drove German troops away from Moscow but depleted the Red Army's reserves, the Kharkov offensive was a new Soviet attempt to expand upon their strategic initiative, although it failed to secure a significant element of surprise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On 12 May 1942, both the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts under the command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko launched an offensive against the German 6th Army from a salient established during the winter counter-offensive. After a promising start, the offensive was stopped on 15 May by massive airstrikes. Critical Soviet errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly raised forces, facilitated a German pincer attack on 17 May which cut off three Soviet field armies from the rest of the front by 22 May. Hemmed into a narrow area, the 250,000-strong Soviet force inside the pocket was exterminated from all sides by German armored, artillery and machine gun firepower as well as 7,700 tonnes of air-dropped bombs. After six days of encirclement, Soviet resistance ended as their troops were killed or taken prisoner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle was an overwhelming German victory, with 280,000 Soviet casualties compared to just 20,000 for the Germans and their allies. The German Army Group South pressed its advantage, encircling the Soviet 28th Army on 13 June in Operation Wilhelm and pushing back the 38th and 9th Armies on 22 June in Operation Fridericus II as preliminary operations to Case Blue, which was launched on 28 June as the main German offensive on the Eastern Front in 1942.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kharkov uses the Panzergruppe Guderian system. Situation on the Soviet counter-offensive in Summer 1942. Makes use of untried Soviet units - neither player knows their strength until they enter combat for the first time. Unlike PGG, there are no '0' strength units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Originally published in Strategy &amp;amp; Tactics magazine #68, May/June 1978.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Game Turn: 1 day&amp;#10;Hex: 4.2 miles / 6.9 Kilometers&amp;#10;Units: Regiment to Division&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;One 22 x 32&amp;quot; four color mapsheet&amp;#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&amp;quot; counters)&amp;#10;One 8-page rulebook&amp;#10;One 6-sided dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&amp;#10;Complexity Level: Medium&amp;#10;Players: 2 or more&amp;#10;Playing Time: 4-15&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
