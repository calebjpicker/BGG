						               													<description>The expansion adds 3 new characters to play as for the Mayhem player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scheherazade is one of MAYHEM's most deadly assassins. Others know very little of her past. She is of middle eastern origins and like the story teller of the same name in the Arabian book 'One Thousand and One Nights', she has a story for every person she has killed. &amp;#10;Sheherazade is very quick and lethal. She specializes in taking actions out of turn. At close quarters she attacks with her sword and can keep combo attacking even when it is not her turn. She can also support other agents during their turns by throwing her deadly knives to debuff enemies. But her greatest powers are that she can teleport close to her victim or become invisible with a smokescreen to finish her work.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Oni, a.k.a. Masamune Senichi, is the son of a Japanese businessman who shamed his family by entering the world of organized crime. Apalled that is boss was taking orders from the LEGION's Ministry of Greed, Senichi donned a demon's mask (Oni-Mask) and began a silent hunt to eradicate Greed's organization. The Oni-Mask stem from Japanese folklore and are worn to protection against evil spirits and yokai (ogres).&amp;#10;Oni carries a silenced pistol and through stealth is a lethal killing machine. His attacks panick surrounding enemies and his fear aura lowers their attack and defense abilities. The more he attacks, the more his fear aura grows. This makes him a great support member, since his aura makes it easier for his team members to attack and survive damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kingpin, aka Pierce Washington, is the current leader of the Vice Kings. Pierce had successfully unified all of the gangs of Stilwater under one Vice King flag, which gave him and his lieutenants a united front to defend themselves against LEGION'S Ministry of Gluttony. He then was recruited into MAYHEM as an integral member of the Fire Squad.&amp;#10;Kingpin carries an SMG that spews out damage, a flare gun that has an explosive area of effect, or a plasma thrower that he can charge-up and debuff enemies with. For defense, he not only relies on his speed, but also on the chest armor that he always wears. But Kingpin is not all about violence. He is a chess aficionado, loves people, and is friendly with just about everybody - kind of like a... social butterfly. (Just don't call him this to his face!) Well known for his party dance mixes, he can lay down a mean beat  during battle that will stun enemies that are in range!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
