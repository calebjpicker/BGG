						               													<description>Come to appreciate the classic Chinese poetry!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Poetry Express contains 75 classic poems that are required to be learned in Chinese primary school. Children can read and appreciate these classic works of &amp;quot;painting in poetry, poetry in painting&amp;quot; through the form of games. In the game, children enjoy the learning experience of poetry with their endless imagination by describing the picture expressed by the poem, knowing the poem, expressing the poem, and imagining the artistic conception of the poem.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game setup: Shuffle the cards into a deck, use the top card of the deck to form a 5*5 square matrix with the cards face up. Shuffle the question stick, put them into the container and set it at a convenient place, put the hourglass aside&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start the game: Shake the question stick container, randomly draw 2 sticks, show the 4 keywords on both sides of the display to all players. After all of the players have confirmed the keywords, the first play reverse the hourglass, all players find and take the poem cards that meet the requirements from the square mix. Players check each other's poem cards after taking the cards that meet the requirements or after the hourglass's time is over. If a player picks up a poem card that doesn't match any keywords, the player should put all the poem cards taken from this round in front of them with the frontside of the cards facing up. If the poetry cards you take meet more than 1 requirement, for each additional keyword meet the requirement, you can take an additional poetry card from the deck (with the backside facing up, without checking the frontside of the card) as a reward, put all the poems cards and reward cards in front of you with the backside of the card facing up&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To end the game: The game ends when there is no more question stick to draw or cannot complete the 5*5 square matrix with the poem cards. Each backside-up poem card counts 1 point, and each two frontside-up poem cards counts -1 point. Less than two frontside-up cards will not count the score. The player with the highest total score is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
