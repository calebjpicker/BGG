						               													<description>WXRDS is a fast-paced, crossword-style word game where players collect letters that match words from specific categories. After collecting a set of letters, players form crossed words on their individual game boards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COMPONENTS:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     99 letter tiles with point values 1-5&amp;#10;     6 gameboards with built-in scoring tracks&amp;#10;     web app.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SET UP:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flip all tiles face up between players.&amp;#10;Give each player a game board and set the scores to 0.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Start the web app to reveal a category.&amp;#10;Players call out words that match the category and grab the first letter of their word. For example, if the category is &amp;quot;In the Kitchen&amp;quot;, someone could grab the letter &amp;quot;K&amp;quot; for knife.&amp;#10;The app sets a 30 second timer to encourage rapid collection of letters. In case an identical word is called out, the first player grabs the respective letter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ten category rounds are played in order to collect ten letters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After ten categories, players then have three minutes to use their letters to form crossed words on their game boards (Scrabble-style).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SCORING:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After three minutes, players score their words. Letters placed on bonus positions get 2x and 3x points. All words must be found in the dictionary to be valid. Invalid words are removed. Any letters not on the board have their points deducted from the score. Each player marks their score on their scoring tracks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After validation and scoring, return the letters to the common draw pile and start the app again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WINNING:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After several main rounds, the first player to exceed 99 points causes the game to end. The player with the highest score is the winner. In case of a tie, play another round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
