						               													<description>Hangulnal (&amp;quot;Hangeul Day&amp;quot;) is a game where you look at picture cards and make words associated with them. 'Hangeul' means Korean characters.&amp;#10;If you create associated words, you can get additional points and tiles.&amp;#10;Look at picture cards and combine consonant and vowel tiles to create associated words to get a lot of points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set Up&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Place the board in the center of the table.&amp;#10;     Each person selects the color of the meeples and get the same number of meeples as the number of participants. Then place one at each load start point on the board.&amp;#10;     Make a deck of picture cards as many as the number of people participating in the game, and place them next to each load with the back side facing up so that the front side is not visible. (4 decks for 4 people, 3 decks for 3 people, 2 decks for 2 people)&amp;#10;     The tiles are divided into consonant and vowel pockets, &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;mixed well, and then each gets 10 consonant tiles and 8 vowel tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Players all shout &amp;ldquo;one, two, three,&amp;rdquo; and flip the top card from the card deck in front of you so that the front of the card is visible.&amp;#10;     All players select one of the open picture cards to create a word associated with that card. The word must be at least &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2 characters long. (The words on the picture card or the English pronunciation of those words cannot be created.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     You can create words until the last person to create the words comes up, and the person who created associated words should shout &amp;ldquo;Hangeul Day!&amp;rdquo;.&amp;#10;     From the first player who shouted 'Hangeul Day', each player one by one reveals the associated words that they created, and moves the meeples one block from the load with corresponding picture card. (If other player think the associated words don't fit at all, they can nullify with a majority vote.)&amp;#10;     After moving meeples, take the same number of tiles from the pocket as the number of icons displayed in the stopped &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;column and finish your turn. Taking additional tiles makes the game easier because there are more possible characters to create as the game progresses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;         You can replace the 3 tiles you have until the end of the game (consonants, vowels, or consonants+vowels) with 1 tile of your choice.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;     When first person's turn ends, the second person to shout &amp;ldquo;Hangeul Day&amp;rdquo; takes the turn, and the next person to shout take the next turn.&amp;#10;     If you created the another word on the same load as the previous player in your turn, move it to the nearest blank space from that location. (Multiple meeples cannot be in the same column.) &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you select load and create words that are same as the previous player, only the person who originally created the word will be recognized and you will not be able to move your meeples.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of the Game&amp;#10;The game ends when three meeples arrive at the final destination point of 10 points, and the person with the most points win by adding up the points written in the space where each meeple is placed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;         Contact Publisher&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MAGICBEANGAMES(Republic of Korea)&amp;#10;e-mail : magicbean@magicbeangame.com&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
