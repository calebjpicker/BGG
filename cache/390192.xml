						               													<description>Felduz (from Proto&amp;ndash;Germanic: Fel&amp;thorn;uz, meaning &amp;quot;field&amp;quot;) is a card game for two to four players that is played using a standard deck of playing cards and betting chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Objective:&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to form the best possible combination of cards to win the most chips through betting or to cause the other players to fold in each round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; A French deck of 40 cards (without 8, 9, or 10).&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Betting chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Card values:&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Ace: 1 point.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Jack: 8 points.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Queen: 9 points.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; King: 10 points.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; The rest of the cards have their own value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Definitions:&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; The open field is a set of cards owned by a player and visible to the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; The closed field is a set of cards owned by a player and hidden from the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; The reserve is a set of cards that a player discards when they complete their combination of cards. It can be a minimum of zero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hierarchy of events:&amp;#10;The game is divided into three events in order of importance:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Point: lowest possible sum of points from the open field with a minimum of 40, along with the lowest value from the reserve (using the reserve as a tiebreaker).&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Length: the least number of cards in the field.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Rank: lowest card in the field, and in case of a tie, the next lowest card and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player wins &amp;quot;Point&amp;quot;, the other events are ignored. If there is a tie in &amp;quot;Point&amp;quot;, the game continues with &amp;quot;Length&amp;quot;, and if there is another tie, it continues with &amp;quot;Rank&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Distribution:&amp;#10;In the first round, a player is randomly selected as the dealer, who deals five cards to each player, which become their field. The rest of the cards are placed face down in the middle of the table to form the deck. In the next round, the player to the left of the current dealer becomes the dealer. At the beginning of each round, players place three of their five cards face up on the table to form the &amp;quot;open field&amp;quot;, and they leave the other two in their hand to form the &amp;quot;closed field&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turns:&amp;#10;The player to the left of the dealer begins the turn and performs these actions in the following order:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Optionally, bet a number of chips.&amp;#10;2. Take a card from the deck and places it in their &amp;quot;closed field,&amp;quot; or decides to stand.&amp;#10;3. Choose one of your cards in the &amp;quot;closed field&amp;quot; and place it in the &amp;quot;open field&amp;quot; or decide to stand by choosing not to take any more cards from the deck and placing a number of cards horizontally from your &amp;quot;closed field&amp;quot;. Reserve cards are not included in the sum because they are part of the discard. Once you stand you can't keep taking cards from the deck.&amp;#10;4. Pass the turn to the player on your left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Betting:&amp;#10;Before dealing the cards, mandatory &amp;quot;blind&amp;quot; bets are placed. Each player bets without seeing their cards. If a player decides to bet, the other players can:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Accept the bet by saying &amp;quot;I want&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Reject the bet by saying &amp;quot;I don't want to&amp;quot; and lose the round.&amp;#10;&amp;ndash; Raise the bet by saying &amp;quot;I raise&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When all players have accepted the bet, the chips are accumulated in the &amp;quot;pot&amp;quot;. The player who wins the round takes all the chips in the pot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of the game:&amp;#10;When a player runs out of chips to bet, they are eliminated from the game. The game ends when only one player who has not been eliminated remains, who is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
