						               													<description>In this game set in the universe of the stage personas of the Finnish Metal Band Lordi, every card is a monster. You, as a player, are trying to make a team of monsters that can help you most effectively slaughter your opponent's monsters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first phase of the game is played by playing single monsters from the players' hands and comparing &amp;quot;Force.&amp;quot; The highest force wins. The winner of that match up (Or &amp;quot;round&amp;quot;) draws a card from the top of the deck and decides to keep either it and one of the played cards, or both played cards, yielding the one remaining card to the loser.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the entire deck is depleted and both players have their teams, they check to see point totals. A whole &amp;quot;Team&amp;quot; Based on its lead characters is worth Ten points, incomplete teams are only worth one point per character(For a maximum of four) if you have no complete teams, you lose automatically. The hands are broken up into their teams and incomplete ones are compiled into another deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the least points starts the team battles by playing one card from one team and may only use this team until it is gone, same with the enemy player. A third card is drawn from the deck to determine weapon values of both cards. The highest total force still wins. The game ends when all teams have been returned to the deck and the player with the most points wins the battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
