						               													<description>Tributo de Sangre (Tribute of Blood) is an operational game for two players, framed in the colonial conflict that confronted the Spanish Army with the hardened local tribes of the Rif (North of the Moroccan Sultanate) which was administered by Spain as a Protectorate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game focuses on the peak phase of the conflict, led by the Campaign before and after the so-called &amp;quot;Annual Disaster&amp;quot; (1921), which caused the death in combat of thousands of Spanish soldiers. A tragic episode that would decisively mark the political and military future of Spain during the two incoming decades.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tribute of Blood is a card driven game, with a map of areas that replicates the domains of the Riffian tribes, and a network of connected spaces that allow a &amp;ldquo;point to point&amp;rdquo; movement through a rugged territory, suitable for ambushes and surprise raids.&amp;#10;The basic mechanics consist of the use of action points to deploy movement, logistics, offensive and diplomatic operations. The events of the cards will serve as drivers of these actions, while providing the necessary &amp;quot;historical flavor&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During each game turn, players will be able to launch raids, incursions, charges, sieges, assaults..., as well as pressure their opponent with various diplomatic actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Tribute of Blood, one player represents the Spanish Army and another the Riffian rebels. The game can be summarized in a pendulum movement, with both sides adopting offensive and defensive postures during different phases of the Campaign: the Rif side enjoys the initiative during the first turns and has the chance to cause a disaster similar to the historical one in Spanish lines. Starting on turns 6 and 7, the Spanish reinforcements will even the scales and provide the opportunity to regain control of the territory and avenge their deaths.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is asymmetrical in many of its mechanics, beginning with the different positional &amp;quot;habitat&amp;quot; of each of the contenders: the Spanish formations move from point to point, through connection lines, while the Riffian rebels (harcas) unfold and move inside and through the areas (Cabilas). This means that there is not a defined combat front, and the Spanish must launch constant incursions to confront Abd-el Krim's warriors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tribute of Blood consists of the following scenarios, each with an increasing level of depth and complexity:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- 1. Historical Scenario: &amp;quot;Annual's Disaster&amp;quot; (5 turns)&amp;#10;- 2. Alternative Scenario: &amp;quot;Avoiding Disaster&amp;quot; (5 turns)&amp;#10;- 3. Advanced Scenario: &amp;ldquo;Recapture of the Kert&amp;rdquo; (11 turns)&amp;#10;- 4. Annual Campaign; 1921: (16 turns)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COMPONENTS.&amp;#10;Tribute of Blood includes the following components:&amp;#10;&amp;bull; One 22&amp;quot; x 34&amp;quot; map&amp;#10;&amp;bull; 316 full-color die cut counters (units, harcas and markers)&amp;#10;&amp;bull; 110 cards (46 event cards and 64 action cards)&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Two Set Up Cards&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#151;&amp;#143; One Columns Holder&amp;#10;&amp;bull; 2 Faction Tracks&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Two sets of two 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; player aid cards&amp;#10;&amp;bull; 8 six-sided dice&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Scenario book&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A simulation of an irregular and asymmetric warfare, with interesting innovations on mechanics and interactions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
