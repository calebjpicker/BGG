						               													<description>Quick-playing but detailed simulations of college baseball. Instant download, print and play game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Features Easy to set up &amp;amp; play: Just shuffle the action cards and play. (If you want to keep score, enter the player and team names onto the provided score sheet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All play derived from 100 &amp;quot;action cards&amp;quot;: Each card is 2-sided.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Statistically accurate: Every college team from the 2005-2006 season, along with the players, are rated in every major statistical category.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All division I college teams represented.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each team and player rated in several categories: Every statistic you would expect to be covered is here. Batting average, singles, doubles, triples, home runs, stolen base attempts, stolen base success percentage, opponent's batting average, strikeout &amp;amp; walk frequency and team error ratings are all here.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Keep score as you play and compile stats&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All players listed by position, with usage chart included. This enable you to replay games where the players appear in realistic fashion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Optional injury system&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Exclusive &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; ratings: One problem I've found with other baseball sims is the lack of realistic batter/pitcher interaction. With the control system, you will see the great hitter outperform the mediocre pitcher (and vice-versa) in a more consistent manner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game engine drives the action. Players will even attempt to steal bases without your input. Of course, you can always call the shots if you prefer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game contents&amp;#10;complete rule book, including a detailed description of a partial sample game, useful as a tutorial.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Set of action cards, ready for printing&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Score sheet&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Out chart &amp;amp; extras chart&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Team cards, divided by division/conference. Each conference is printed on one separate .pdf file, all organized within division.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FAQ&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What do the team cards look like?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Depending on the roster size, anywhere from about half a page (8-1/2X11&amp;quot;) to almost a full page. The tops of the cards are in the team's school colors. All data is organized into color-coded colums for easy reading.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can I edit the team/player data?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sure, if you wish to do so. I may release a semi-automated editor for excel if there is any interest in such.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can I set lineups, call plays, make substitutions, etc?&amp;#10;      You set your lineups and make substitutions. There are a few provisions for calling special plays, such as bunting, hit-and-run, and playing the infield &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;. The game being a self-contained simulation, it needs little user input. Having played other basetball games which feature individual player cards, setting of lineups, keeping track of stamina, etc., I wanted something that would yield even more realistic results with less work on the user's part.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
