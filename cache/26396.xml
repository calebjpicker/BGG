						               													<description>From the publisher's description:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Re-live the excitement of the 2005 Funny Car Season.  The 2005 Season was one of the closest Points races in the history of the sport.  The top 3 drivers were separated by a mere 32 points, and the top 10 in points were separated by an amazing 442 points.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Anything that can happen in a real life drag racing event; can and will happen with the same frequency in Championship Drag Racing. Drivers will red-light, have tremendous reaction times, blow up their engines, and even crash with the same frequency as the year represented. And as with any replay game that is worth its salt there are allowances made within the confines of realistic frequency for ANYTHING to truly happen.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;In general, your results will be very close to the on-the-track action of the season represented. However, keep in mind, that this game simulates hundreds of variables that can occur in any race. As with any sport, sometimes pure luck can be the deciding factor. That&amp;rsquo;s no exception with Championship Drag Racing. On the whole, you&amp;rsquo;ll experience very realistic results. But, within the confines of a single qualifying run or elimination race, anything can truly happen!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Championship Drag Racing: Funny Car Edition gives you every Funny Car Racer that made a qualifying attempt in 2005. You also get all 23 circuits rated by lane making the lane choice strategy just as important as real life. A full schedule, complete points standings, complete final ladders for each event, as well as a list of drivers that attempted to make every field are included.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
