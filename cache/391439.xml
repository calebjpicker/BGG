						               													<description>Spin to Win Words is a simple spelling game. Two to four players make words by spinning letters on an everchanging board. Three-letter words are the primary target, however two- and -four letter words are possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gain points by aligning arrows in lines similar to tic-tac-toe but with letters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SETUP:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Start with one of the random 3x3 game boards and two stacks of single letters and bigram letters cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player maintains two cards of each type (single &amp;amp; bigram). Combining two cards, a player calls out a word and spins the top card to point at the player.&amp;#10;When three cards in a straight line point to a player, that player scores one point. However, if the cards are all of the same type (single or bigram), the player scores two points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues until someone scores 10 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
