						               													<description>Crownfall is a 2-4 player game where players take turns flicking their army of Blinks at their opponent&amp;rsquo;s Blinks to try to knock them out of the battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SETUP&amp;#10;CHOOSE YOUR BATTLEFIELD&amp;#10;First, choose a smooth surface such as a floor or tabletop to be your battlefield, and set the boundaries of your arena (the edges of the table, or lines on the ground). Then create a real or imaginary line to divide the battlefield in half and choose a side. This determines where you can place your army during&amp;#10;the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ASSEMBLE YOUR ARMY&amp;#10;Next, take an even number of Blinks and divide them in half between the players. If playing with more than 2 people, players will need to group up into 2 teams.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each team clusters their Blinks together and then single-clicks any Blink to swap between the two team colors.&amp;#10;To muster an army, triple-click any Blink in the cluster to turn it into a Crown. All other Blinks will become the army. Blinks will assign themselves one of 9 roles depending on how many Blinks they are away from the Crown Blink. As you play, try to find a unique setup formation that creates your &amp;#10;perfect strategic army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, each team distributes their army throughout their side of the battlefield, making sure that no two Blinks are touching. The game then begins with the starting player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAMEPLAY&amp;#10;The goal of Crownfall is to reduce your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Crown to 0 health. Each turn, a player can perform up to 2 actions. A player can use one or both of their actions to flick one of their Blinks, generally with the goal of knocking enemy Blinks off the table, but sometimes to accomplish other strategic ends. Unless otherwise specified, a player cannot flick or activate the ability of the same Blink more than once in the same turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can also choose to activate the power of one of their army Blinks as an action. Many roles have a power that can be activated with an action, but several have passive powers which do not require an action. All powers are detailed at the end of the rules. If, during play, a Blink connects to another Blink, you must separate the two by 1 inch and rotate them so that they are no longer aligned to each other. Some powers may affect this rule.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a Blink falls off the table or out of the bounds of the battlefield as the result of a flick, whether intentional or by accident, that Blink is dead - unless it&amp;rsquo;s a Crown or affected by a special ability. Set your dead Blinks to the side, out of the battlefield&amp;rsquo;s boundary but within reach of the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;WIN CONDITION&amp;#10;The first player to lower their opponent&amp;rsquo;s Crown to 0 health wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To reset your army and start a new game - cluster your Blinks together and triple-click one of them to reset the cluster back to setup.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;VARIANT RULES&amp;#10;Crownfall has multiple rule variations and alternative modes of play. For all variations and a more in-depth explanation of the rules, see the full instructions document online at blinks.games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
