						               													<description>Kartoffelkrieg is a light-weight family-friendly &amp;quot;potato war-game&amp;quot; using real potatoes equipped with plastic miniature parts and weapons. The game can be played virtually anywhere, including non-flat surfaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, players take turns drawing and choosing part boards with which to equip their potatoes, resulting in asymmetric character setup. Parts include treads, legs, shields, power supplies, guns, cannons, and other weapons with various abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After choosing their parts, players then insert the corresponding miniature pieces into physical potatoes, and place them on the table as specified according to the number of players. Players set up their control boards, assign each part board strategically to the control board, and set all parts and potatoes to maximum power and zero damage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a game, players take turns using the power their potatoes produce to perform various actions with their parts. For example, a potato could use power to use their treads and move or ram another player. Alternatively, they could fire off one of their weapons, and attempt to damage another player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each part is different, has different power requirements, ranges, abilities, accuracy, and damage that it can give or take. Some parts require dice rolling to determine the hit location and damage amount. Players can continue using their parts for various actions, until their power reaches zero. At that point, their turn is over. Their power will reset on the subsequent turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a part reaches maximum damage, the attacking player who caused that damage, removes the part from the potato, and keeps it as a victory point. The defending player removes the part board from their control board. That section of the control board is now unprotected, meaning that future damage to that location can now directly hurt the potato/control board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When any one person reaches maximum damage on their player board, the game ends immediately. The winner is the person who destroyed the most parts and has the most victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
