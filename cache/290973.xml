						               													<description>5 Different Treasure Hunt Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Free! Dr. Scratchov Scratcher!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;disposable games to scratch, play &amp;amp; throw away&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECTIVE:  You are risk-seeking archaeologists on a expedition for exotic treasure.  Danger surrounds you and your archrival is out to beat you to the fortune.  The player who collects the most treasure by the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY:  Take turns trying to locate a treasure by drawing straight lines between any 2 dots on the map.  Lines can be drawn vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.  When you draw a line that connects all four sides of a square, the find at that location is yours.  Immediately scratch off that spot to reveal a prize (or perhaps trouble).  If you locate treasure, circle the matching item on your stone scoring tablet to keep a record of your newly found wealth.  There are four different kinds of treasure:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GOLD COINS - Worth 1 point each&amp;#10;BLACK PEARLS - Worth 5 points each&amp;#10;CUT RUBIES - Worth 10 points each&amp;#10;SOLID GOLD ICON - Worth 25 points&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After finding a reassure, you must immediately continue your turn by drawing another line; even if you don't want to.  Archaeology is a dangerous business and sometimes you get more that you bargained for.  Head hunters are about and thief is lurking somewhere in the area.  If you happen to find either, you're in trouble.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HEAD HUNTER - A threatening little person who stops you in your tracks.  You lose your turn immediately (but you're too clever to lose you head).  Nevertheless, your opponent takes a turn while you figure your way out of this predicament.&amp;#10; THIEF- An encounter with the thief is a costly mistake.  He is well trained at slipping through your fingers and takes with him one piece of the most valuable treasure you have discovered so far.  If you have any treasure, mark one piece of the best off your stone tablet.  It's gone for good.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Super Secret Rule of Archaeological Exploration:  Treasure is found in groups.  Find something valuable and the rest of the same treasure is sure to be connected!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
