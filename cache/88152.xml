						               													<description>This is a game from India published for the purpose of educating children in the teachings of the guru Gnani Purush Shri Ambalal Muljibhai Patel, also known as Dada Bhagwan. It consists of two separate boardgames: &amp;quot;Dada's World&amp;quot;, which teaches about how to behave apropriately in given situations and answer questions about the guru's teachings; and &amp;quot;Guess, Who Am I?&amp;quot;, which focuses on identifying role models.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 1 (Dada's World) - Players roll a die and move along a track which represents their journey through Dada's World, collecting rectangular plastic &amp;quot;coins&amp;quot; with a variety of point values. &amp;#10;Landing on marked spaces along the track can either add points (Helped Poor Person: 100), subtract points (Killed a cockroach: -150), provide the opportunity to answer questions about Dada's teachings to earn points (Dadai Dhamaka), lose turns, take extra turns, go back to Home, and other similar effects. At certain points on the track, players have the opportunity to pay points to take a shorter route.&amp;#10;The winner is the first player to make a complete circuit of the track and return to the start space with 1500 points or more. Players who complete the track with fewer than 1500 points must go back to an earlier square and try to accumulate more points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game 2 (Guess, Who Am I?) - Players roll a die and move along a track collecting pieces of three separate puzzles. Most of the spaces on the board are marked with a statement associated with one of the three &amp;quot;role models&amp;quot; - Parents, Dadashri and Humanity. When landing on a space on the board, players must identify which role model is associated with the statement on that space (example: Space #17 &amp;quot;We should bow down to them every day&amp;quot; is associated with Parents). Correctly identifying the role model allows the player to take the puzzle piece associated with that space. &amp;#10;Other spaces give the player a free random puzzle piece, allow the player to take a piece from another player, or cause the player to lose a turn. Players who reach the end of the track without winning the game move back to Start and continue to collect puzzle pieces.&amp;#10;To win, a player must collect all 12 pieces of one of the three puzzles. He may then assemble the puzzle to see a picture representing one of the role models, then flip the pieces over to reveal a message.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the rule booklet:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hello kids!!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Time to enter DADA'S WORLD filled with excitement, fun &amp;amp; learn.....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This 2-in-1 Game Pack offer dual knowledge and fun, Get the tracks right from 'Home' to 'Simandhar City' and back 'Home' in Game 1. If you follow the rule you are IN, if you refrain then you commit a SIN.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also recognize the ROLE MODELS of your life by learning their virtues and identifying them in Game 2. Abount Parents, Dadashri and humanity is what we get to learn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wow! So much to do, so much to learn, so little time we want more fun, then grab on this Game Pack 2-in-1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
