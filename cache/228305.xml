						               													<description>Description from the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Strap yourselves in for the future of racing... Time machine racing! Participants race as fast as they can to reach specific checkpoints in time throughout a day and then race back to the moment they left. The racer with the least amount of time missing on his internal clock wins! Beware of other racers on the time track as they can short you out and make you miss your connection! Pick up tricks, weapons, and boosters when successfully hitting your time checkpoints in your silly little time machine! This is a very easy game with lots of fun stuff going on. Totally safe for kids over 4 who don't put random stuff in their mouths. &amp;#10;1-5 Players pick unusual time machines each with their own weapons or abilities and then race around 6 clocks using a 13 spaced spinner and 2 dice. Players pick up boosters as they lock in checkpoints in time and try not to be lost in the fabric of time and space by shorting out. Depending on the number of players short out limits can be 3-6. If a player completely shorts out all acquired checkpoints and cards are lost and the player must pick a new time machine card to start over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Booster cards are acquired by locking in a checkpoint each player has the chance to collect a total of 5 of these in a game and they can give the user special weapons, advancements, or tricks. After all players have locked in a checkpoint time wraith tokens are placed on the five outer clocks. These devil drivers are trying to catch you. Some are good and some are bad. The spinner is used any time the game starts to find your spot on the central clock or anytime someone either shorts out or locks in a clock and must return to the central clock to continue. There are 6 black holes on the board. One on the 13 in the central clock and 5 on the bands that lead out to the outer clocks. These short you out as well as if any player lands on you. after the spinner is used players roll 2 dice to advance Players must travel up the next band to the next clock that they do not already have acquired. If a player rolls doubles They go again but after 3 sets of doubles the player shorts out. &amp;#10; To win players must lock in all checkpoints on the outer clocks by landing on the set time indicated on the clocks and then return to the center clock and lock it in as well.&amp;#10; This game comes with colored stones to place as markers when clocks are locked in, custom cast pewter game pawns, wraith tokens, and spinner device set in laser cut 1/8th-inch birch, an Eco canvas 18-inch game board and, a few extra black holes for the black hole generators.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
