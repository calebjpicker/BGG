						               													<description>Racing 1 is a racing game for 2-6 players with a high level of strategy and resource management. You will be able to play stand-alone races or the campaign mode that will take you through a World Championship where you will develop your team throughout the 6-race season.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game, each player must choose a team and driver and will receive a team log (paper booklet) where they will record the results of the race and the development of their team throughout the season.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before each race, each player will have a double-sided board (steering wheel) to manage their resources during the race, such as energy, tires and fuel. In addition to a card deck of each type of tire you have chosen for that race (soft, medium or hard).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of each race will be to finish in the first position efficiently using all your resources to earn the most points and profits possible to improve your team for the next race.&amp;#10;While the objective of the career mode will be to get the most points at the end of the season to win the drivers' world championship or the teams' championship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn you must:&amp;#10;Take 5 cards from your tire deck and play a minimum of 2 or up to 5 cards.&amp;#10;Advance your car the spaces corresponding to the total value of your played cards&amp;#10;Advance o move back the corresponding spaces for your chosen car configuration for that race.&amp;#10;Use your resources; energy, fuel or driver skills.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also at the start of each race you can use your earnings to upgrade your car by purchasing new tech part cards that will give you an upgrade in the Curve or Straight sectors in the race. So the mix of tech pieces you choose for your car's race setup is crucial.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the other hand, during the race you will earn experience points that you can use between races to improve your driver's skills or that you can use during the race to develop the skills that your driver currently has.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Race ends when all players have reached the finish line and points and winnings are distributed to each player depending on their finishing position. While the season ends when 6 races are completed and a winning driver and team are defined.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course there will be some other cool racing features like DRS system, Safety Car, weather changes that will affect the performance of your tires, dice mechanics for the Pit stops, and much more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will be able to play a new season with the same races or adding new ones and maintain the development of your team and driver for the new season. So, you will start as a rookie, but how far can you get?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
