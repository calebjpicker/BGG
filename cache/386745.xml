						               													<description>It's a 2-player strategy board game with cartoon rodents on a battlefield using modular tiles. The battle takes place between the Cano (volcano) and Castle players. Each player must navigate the types of terrain; grass, burrow, obstacle &amp;amp; gateway in order to raid the opponents Gateway Tile on the opposite side of the battlefield.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player must use a selection from the 8 raidents that each have a unique signature ability and also a special ability unlocked in burrow terrain. Firstly, the Rabbot is a cyborg rabbit that uses it's portals to raid the opponent's gateways. The Engineaver is a beaver that specialises in destruction rather than construction. The Hamsterrain is a hamster with telekinetic powers to literally control the terrain. The Ratillery is a long-range ballista operated by rats. The Porcupyro is a porcupine that likes to scorch earth and make hot cross bunnies. The Squirrilla is a squirrel that uses it's arboreal talents for guerrilla tactics. The Gophert is a covert gopher that is able to access all areas of the field through it's network of burrows. Lastly, the Chipmonk is a chipmunk that lives a life of ascetic sacrifice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Only the player that is able to adapt to the terrain and sabotage their opponent's plans before they sabotage yours, will be able to win the battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
