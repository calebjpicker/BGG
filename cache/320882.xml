						               													<description>Fight Sequence is the tactical reverse action-programming dueling game about psychics THINKING about fighting! Players build sequences of attacks and responses that resolve in reverse order, representing the ebb and flow of a theoretical fantasy fight scene two psychics are projecting into each other's minds. Planning your own moves isn't the only key to victory; you'll also use your psychic and magical abilities to manipulate when - or IF - actions resolve!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players select one of the four characters in a diverse cast of psychic combatants, using their unique skillsets to emerge victorious. Every character deck has its own strengths and weaknesses, with a depth of tactical play that ensures no two fights are the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Fight Sequence, players take turns playing Actions or passing, building a series of Actions until both players pass consecutively [with passes being forced once the maximum sequence size of 9 Actions is met]. Once that happens, the entire sequence then resolves in reverse order, starting with the last Action played. Timing your Actions for maximum effect is crucial, but every character has some ability to manipulate that timing to work more in their favor. Even the best-laid plans aren't foolproof!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Actions are either attacks or responses - use your attacks to damage your opponent, and your responses to defend yourself from opposing attacks or support your strategy. Every card in the game can be played as either an attack or a response, so you're never out of options. Damage is represented by discarding cards from your deck; no paper, pen, dice, or tracker apps required. Just choose your characters, shuffle your decks, and begin!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to four varied characters with different styles and movesets, The First Chapter also includes the Academy decks, which use a more streamlined subset of cards to help ease players into the reverse-action-programming nature of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-- description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
