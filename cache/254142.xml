						               													<description>Following the annihilation of Earth, human survivors struggle to rebuild their once-great planet, only to be faced with a new threat. The Robotech Masters arrive to complete the mission that their Zentraedi armada began... to secure their empire by reclaiming the Protoculture matrix before it is located by the Invid. In their way stands the Army of the Southern Cross!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The exciting, stand-alone sequel to SolarFlare Games&amp;rsquo; ROBOTECH: Force of Arms lets you take control of the epic conflict known as the Second Robotech War. One player takes the lead as the plotting, scheming, desperate Robotech Masters, while the other player commands the valiant and determined Army of the Southern Cross.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this head-to-head card game, players are engaged in conflict for control of the Earth, each side pitting their varied infantry and mecha-based units against each other in an all-out war with only one victor. In addition to their mecha and weapons, players wield powerful command actions and amazing heroes to turn the tide of conflict and ensure victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ROBOTECH: Crisis Point is a two-player head-to-head card game. Strategy, tactics, area control, bluffing, and hand management all come into play in this dynamic and deep game of Alien vs Human in a battle of wits and courage. Will you save humanity or utterly destroy it?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;+  + + +&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robotech: Crisis Point is a strategic game of unit movement and area control in which you take on the role of either the Army of the Southern Cross (AoSC) or the dreaded Robotech Masters. You and your opponent maneuver your units trying to defeat the enemy's forces. Using heroes and distinctive commands at the right time can turn the tide of the battle in your favor. Are you ready to defend Earth as the courageous Army of the Southern Cross or capture the flower of life as the Robotech Masters?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, players try to destroy their opponent's units while also successfully defending their own forces. Players take turns tactically deploying units, strategically placing their combat and support units to defend their own forces and destroy those of their enemy, while using their hero and command cards to win the day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the players have finished the tactical, token, and command/hero phases, they tally up the victory points for the units and strategic locations successfully defended. They then add the victory points for the enemy units they were able to successfully destroy. The player with the most points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
