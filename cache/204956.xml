						               													<description>In Club Town, all players are town planners helping to build up a town into a thriving metropolis. Players would be competing to gain favorable building contracts, build up the city, making sound financial investments as well as making financial contribution to impress the town council and mayor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Club Town is a unique town building game that uses trick taking as its main action selection mechanic. Heavily inspired by Hearts and Diamonds (designer: Mike Fitzgerald), each suit is will have its associated action and players will need to take stock of what has been dealt to them, plan their strategy and out-think their opponent to be the most prestigious firm in town.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In a trick, each player would play a card following the lead and the suit would determine the action a player may take and the value determines how much money or investment opportunities may be gained or spent during the action: Spades to build buildings, Hearts to gain investor prospects, Clubs to earn income and Diamonds to invest in buildings. Being the leader would allow you control what everyone may do, but watch out as someone might pair their card with Influence (Joker) card to trump yours instead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends in four rounds running the whole poker deck twice and the prestige would be gained from buildings, their own investments in buildings and having the majority in favors in the Town Hall. May you be the one who outsmarts your friends and gain the highest prestige to be declared the prime developer in town!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
