						               													<description>On September 25th 2020, the domestic terrorist group known as &amp;ldquo;The Watchers&amp;rdquo; kidnapped a diplomat&amp;rsquo;s wife and is holding her ransom.  They demand the release of several of their members from prison before they let her go.  An informant has told the authorities where she is located and the FBI&amp;rsquo;s Special Weapons and Tactics team has been ordered to rescue her and bring the terrorists to justice.  Little do they know, but the media has tipped off the terrorists and they have a surprise waiting for the S.W.A.T. Team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, the terrorists setup by placing the hostage in a building with two guards.  They then write down where their hidden sniper and mine will be placed. After this, they roll to see how many terrorist rifleman they will have and place them on the map.  The sniper is a hidden unit and is not placed on the map until he fires or a unit moves adjacent to him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The S.W.A.T. forces initially enter in truck from the West and East end of the map.  During their first turn one of their trucks will run over the hidden mine and the truck will be destroyed and the occupants must roll saves to see if they survive.  The S.W.A.T. forces have one additional unit that can enter on any turn in a helicopter.  If the helicopter lands adjacent to any terrorist unit (including the hidden sniper) it will be shot down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, the S.W.A.T. forces will battle the terrorists and possibly try to arrest some of them.  Arrest attempts are dangerous and the S.W.A.T. unit can be killed in the process.  Once the S.W.A.T. team eliminates any terrorists guards holding the hostage, they can move in and take control of her.  They then need to transport her off map either on foot, in a truck or with the helicopter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when either the hostage is rescued or all the S.W.A.T. team members are killed.  Victory points are then calculated to see which side won and what level of victory they achieved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is designed for 2 players, but plays fairly well solitaire.  Most games last around 25 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
