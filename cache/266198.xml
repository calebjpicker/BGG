						               													<description>A card deck that can be used in many ways. Can even be used as dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;54 cards + 2 rule cards forms a deck of 56 cards. The deck can be used as normal playing cards from 2 to ace + jokers. But also as a Japanese Hanafuda deck (48 cards + 6 jokers). The cards can be used playing Trumps, Dingo, Old Maid and other games also.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can also battle with the characters. Pick five random cards each and do not show your opponent. The rest of the cards is placed in a &amp;ldquo;dice pile&amp;rdquo;. The player who most recently was in a fight (for real!) start. It might be back in preschool? Pick one of your characters and decide if you want to do a physical attack; the sword or a mental attack; the candle. Sword attacks are obviously defended by the shield and candle attacks are defended by the smiley face; humour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The opponent picks out a character he thinks can defend without knowing the attacking value. Now both player draws a card from the dice pile and add the eyes on the card's die to their value, starting with the attacker. Highest total wins and is placed in front of the winner as a used character that won the battle. Also place the die card under it, it's the price for winning; a new recruit. The defeated character is placed in bottom of the dice pile (face up) and the die card (face down).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For example: player one (Kajsa) gets Lonar, Cadran, Minx, Dag and Moog. She chooses Lonar, one of the most powerful characters in the game and attacks with brains/candle (value 8). Player two (Kalle) chooses to defend with his character with highest humour, but that is still only Silver (5). Kajsa takes the first card in the dice pile which is Ulg. Ulg has however only 1 eye on his T6. 8 + 1 = 9 in mental attack. Kalle draws the next card and gets Donolen who has 5 eyes on the T6. 5 + 5 = 10. Silver wins and is placed in front of Kalle along with Donolen. They are now battle weary and not available until everybody have fought. Kajsa's Lonar is discarded under the dice pile along with Ulg. But defeated cards like Lonar can return as an undead and is placed face up! Ulg is placed face down like all other cards. Kalle wins the battle and starts the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the numbers are even the result is a tie, place both characters in front of the players, they are also battle weary and not available. However the dice cards are discarded and not won. Continue battling until all characters have fought. If both players have character cards left after everybody has fought, pick them up again and repeat everything. Shuffle the dice pile again and remember to keep the undead face up. The one with the least cards start the next battle. If even use rock-papers-scissors to decide. If an undead gets into your army keep it upside down on your hand. When played it automatically defeats both the opponent and him/herself. Remove the undead from the game after battle. The loser is the player who lost all of his/her cards. If one player has more characters to play than the other those are rested until next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Try adding rules like that darker cards have +1 against lighter cards or that same silhouettes can&amp;rsquo;t fight each other for example.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
