						               													<description>A card and dice game for 2-5 players.  Each player controls 1 town in Alaska and develops his town in order to score the most points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players share a common deck comprising resource (investment) cards and event cards.  The deck comes in three parts.  All the &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; cards are shuffled to make the top third of the decks. All the &amp;ldquo;late&amp;rdquo; cards are shuffled to make the bottom third of the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 13 resource card types:  Indians, Mines, Fish, Wood, Ships, Ground, Air, Government, Military, Oil, Agriculture, Service, and Tourism.  Resource cards have an associated cost, score and revenue value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with 2 dollars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 2 phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.   Revenue Phase&amp;#10;-    Gain 1 dollar for free. &amp;#10;-    Roll 1D6 or 2D6.  Gain revenue from every one of your resources whose score matches your roll. &amp;#10;-    If your roll did not match any of your cards gain a second dollar for free.  &amp;#10;-    Dollars normally come from the Bank. If, however a resource is marked &amp;ldquo;ticket&amp;rdquo;, then 1 dollar comes from an opponent instead of the Bank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2.   Investment Phase&amp;#10;-    The top 3 cards of the deck are turned face up. &amp;#10;-    You may buy one card for its face value. &amp;#10;-    You may buy a second card for double its cost. &amp;#10;-    You may buy the third card for triple its cost. &amp;#10;-    You may buy a fourth card for quadruple the cost and so on. &amp;#10;-    Cards not bought are set aside and can be bought later by any player on their turn in addition to and/or instead of the top 3 that are always revealed.  &amp;#10;-    If the card is an event card it affects the player who draws them. Event cards, once drawn and played, are removed from the game.  If an event card allows a free buy, it must be of a card set aside or drawn this turn; if there are no candidates, it has no effect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when there are no more cards left to draw.  All players in order may ten spend the last of their dollars. Scoring is undertaken as follows:&amp;#10;-    Score 1 VP for every card you own.&amp;#10;-    Score 2 VP for every Government and Military Card.  &amp;#10;-    Score 3 VP for every Oil and Tourism Card. &amp;#10;-    Score 2 VP if you have the most cards of a type (check all 13 types)&amp;#10;The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
