						               													<description>The game is designed to teach baseball to people of all ages, allowing them to make decisions similar to those made in an actual game.  To quote the introduction, &amp;quot;This is the only game approved by the Little League for Little Leaguers... It can be played with easy rules for beginners, so that dad can have fun teaching his boy the fundamentals of Baseball.  It can also be played using all the science and strategy of Major League Baseball.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of a field with a giant &amp;quot;spinner&amp;quot; embedded under it.  There are nine fielders sitting over small squares on the board, four umpires over additional squares, and a batter.  The knob in the center is spun and aligned to a space in front of the pitcher.  The player at bat then decides to swing, bunt or take the pitch.  If the pitch is taken, the umpire behind the plate will call a ball or strike.  This is done by lifting the umpire off a small square revealing the call.  If a swing is made, the batter is lifted off his square and the result of the swing is shown by a number 1-9 (indicating the player position) and the type of hit (ground ball, line drive or fly ball).  The defensive player then lifts the indicated fielder off his square to reveal whether the ball was fielded or not.  If a throw has to be made to a base, the umpire on that base makes the call.  If a runner gets on base, there are red base runners to indicate which base is occupied.  You can attempt steals, bunts, hit-and-run -- all the regular plays in baseball are available.  In addition, all the symbols are printed on the game board in foul ground so its easy to play without looking things up all the time.  A great, simple game that actually plays somewhat like the real thing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Quotes and description from rules printed inside the box lid.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
