						               													<description>There is a mysterious apple orchard.&amp;#10;And the time for harvesting has once again arrived.&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Protect your orchard from insects and birds while taking care of your trees and harvesting your apples.&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;Let&amp;rsquo;s gather as many apples as we can.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player tends to their own orchard and collects apples by strategically placing trees and apples.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, a player should lay down two cards (face up) from their hand to build their personal orchard. There are two types of cards: apples and trees. An orchard is made up a tree column and an apple column. Tree cards are played into the tree column to form a trunk. When the total value of the trunk is greater than or equal to 100, harvesting begins. If the trunk&amp;rsquo;s value is exactly 100, it is an abundant harvest and therefore the player may harvest all apples that they have placed into their apple column. If the value is greater than 100, the player may only harvest a single apple (the uppermost card aka the most recently placed card).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After harvesting, all tree cards are disposed and the player must work to grow another tree.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, a player may also place down cards horizontally to achieve different effects.&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An apple card of the same number can be placed horizontally to create a &amp;ldquo;cluster&amp;rdquo; of fruit. If, for example, this cluster is at the top of the apple column and a player begins harvesting after going over 100 in value, the player will be able to collect all the apples in the cluster (instead of just a single apple). However, if a player harvests their apples upon fulfilling the exactly 100 value requirement, they will only be able to harvest up till the first cluster and not the whole column.&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A tree card of the same number as another tree card can also be placed horizontally to create a branch. After harvesting, the non-trunk cards of this branch do not need to be disposed and instead can be rearranged to form a new column as the new trunk.&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, branches give the player the option to include or exclude the cards forming the branch in their total tree value count (towards 100).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Branches and clusters can only be continuously built on the uppermost card (aka most recently placed card) for the column.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, you can also chose to help tend your neighbor&amp;rsquo;s orchard. You may play any card into their orchard instead of your own. If by doing this you fulfill the 100 value requirement for harvest, you will receive half of your neighbor&amp;rsquo;s apple cards (you chose which half). If you fulfill the over 100 value requirement instead, you will battle with your neighbor over the single apple/cluster card(s).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;Battling consists of playing a &amp;ldquo;war&amp;rdquo;-esque game where both players simultaneously reveal a card from their hand. The player with the higher value tree card will win the apple Card. (Except for in the case that the highest card is 50, which will then allow for a 5 card to win instead.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;At the end of the game (when the drawing deck is empty), this battling comes back into play to decide who gets the remaining unharvested apples in everyone&amp;rsquo;s orchards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are also some special cards including a pigeon card, a woodpecker card, and a bug card which have different effects. Like apple and tree cards, players can choose to play them into their opponents&amp;rsquo; orchards.&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#168;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
