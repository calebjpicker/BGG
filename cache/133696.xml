						               													<description>ZOMBIES AT THE DOOR&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Zombies at the door&amp;rdquo; is a zombie apocalypse card/table-top game for one to two players.  &amp;#10;ZATD is a CARD ONLY GAME with no dice yet you will use your cards as playing elements on the game table for movement, searching, and attacks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns searching throughout their neighborhood for survivors, supplies, and weapons then try to make it back to their safe house alive; all the while zombies are everywhere trying to eat them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal:  Search [4] houses in the neighborhood and find as many survivors as possible.  Along the way you will fight or flee from zombies at every corner; they will be scattered throughout the neighborhood, inside homes and they&amp;rsquo;re constantly multiplying.  You will search for supplies and weapons to help you along the way and rescue survivors who need your help to stay alive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a house is reached, it must be search room-by-room but watch out a zombie could be lurking behind any door!  After all rooms have been searched gather any survivors and head outside but be careful; zombies could be waiting for you.&amp;#10;Always remember that your opponent is out there ready to sabotage your progress, draw zombies to your location, pick up supplies that you&amp;rsquo;ve dropped, and rescue survivors you&amp;rsquo;ve left behind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning conditions: The first player to search and clear [4] houses and return back to his own Safe House with the most survivors alive wins OR if both players have turned into zombies the one with the most survivors inside his Safe House wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Losing conditions:  Unfortunately there is no hope for anyone who dies in Zombies at the door.  With unknown virus spreading throughout the world everyone has been infected and once you die you turn into the living dead.  So, lose your life points and it&amp;rsquo;s off to the zombie brotherhood for you!  Once you become a zombie, you now control a special zombie player card and try to attack and eat your fellow player!  You are also in control of all the zombie movements and attacks until the other player wins or is turned into a zombie, which ends the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ALL FILES CAN BE FOUND IN THE WEBLINKS SECTION!!!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
