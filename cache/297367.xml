						               													<description>You've finally fulfilled your lifelong dream, to open a bar! But when you go to tell your friends, you discover they have also opened bars, in the same town even! So in the spirit of good natured rivalry, you'll stock your bars with the best beer and attract the town's best customers. May the best bar win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Draft Beer is a pick and pass drafting game for 2-6 players, taking approximately 20 minutes to play. There are three rounds where you draft 8 cards, and at the end of each round you will use those cards to attract customers from the town to your bar to score points. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards are double-sided with the front having beers and food that you draft, while the back has the various customers in the town. Each round, players are dealt 8 cards to draft, and 5/6/7 customers will be dealt into the &amp;quot;town&amp;quot; (depending on round). Beer cards have 3 symbols, representing qualities: color, price and taste. These qualities each have 3 possibilities; light, dark, cheap, malty, etc... Customer cards have a point value, and one or two qualities they are looking for. So they may want cheap, light beers, or maybe dark expensive beers. After all the cards have been drafted, players will reveal their bar's selection, then go through the customers one by one to determine which bar they go to. The player whose bar has the most symbols they want is where they will go, and on a tie they will patronize both bars equally (awarding VP chits to all tied players).  Customers are kept until the end of the game for scoring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, there are two other kinds of cards: salty snacks and bar food. These can attract customers, and are kept between rounds to score you points at the end of the game. The players with the most of each will get points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all three rounds have completed, the player with the most points has the most successful bar and is the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
