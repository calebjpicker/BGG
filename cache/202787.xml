						               													<description>A unique motor racing board game simulation based on the real life rules for the 2016 motor racing season. The first in a series with a new racing circuit planned for release each season. Up to 6 players race around the track using authentic lines of travel rather than a grid system. The racing line is the quickest route around the circuit if you can get on it and stay there. Choose to play over 3 or more laps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Use judgement to know when to overtake, slipstream the car in front, or take an alternative line into a corner. Time your pit-stop carefully. Be prepared for random events like a change in the weather, the safety car or engine management issues. If it happens in the real world, it can happen in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Comes with both Basic and Advanced rules for beginners or racing enthusiasts. Advanced rules allow for 5 weather conditions, full tyre selection and choice of driving styles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;New tracks will be based on the 21 international circuits used through the racing season and you will be able to vote on which track you want to see next. They won't be exactly to scale or the game boards will be huge but we will preserve the authentic racing lines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each new circuit will be a self-contained game with up-to-date rules that incorporate New Season changes (such as a return to mid-race refuelling). If the rules change mid-season (as they did with qualifying in 2016) there will be a corresponding game rules change available for download from our main website. The new playing pieces will be in new team colours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For anyone who wants to just keep the same track there will be an update pack available with the new cars, new rules and any additional cards that are necessary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FWR does not attempt to simulate the cockpit driving experience: we felt that was being done much better with electronic console games. Instead, it gives you the fun of competing against family and friends around a table using tactical judgements about what racing line to take, when to try to overtake, when to come into the pits, what to do when the weather changes, when to take risks and when to play safe. The racing dice that contributes to movement only has the numbers 2,3,3,3,4,4. It adds to the fun and unpredictability but is rarely critical. Luck is a factor, just as in the real world but it doesn't dominate the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Far more significant might be a decision about whether to try to overtake the leader on the last lap when you are on dry tyres and it's started raining...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the advanced rules, such decisions become more important. To simulate conditions across the world's racing circuits, there are 6 different types of weather that include factors like temperature as well as rain. You will have access to the full range of dry weather tyre compounds: ultrasoft, supersoft, soft, medium and hard. Three of these will be available for any particular game. Plus, of course, there will be wet weather tyres.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There will be several ways to determine weather conditions and tyre availability at the start of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, in the advanced rules you can change your driving style to suit the prevailing conditions and circumstances. For example, if you have a good lead or are running low on fuel you might want to reduce risk and drive cautiously. If it's the final lap and you want to go flat out to catch the leader, you might take more risks and push the car to the limit.&amp;#10;All up to you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We hope you will enjoy Fifth Wing Racing, collect the tracks and download the Championship rules in 2017 so that you can compete with each other through a season of races. Have fun!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
