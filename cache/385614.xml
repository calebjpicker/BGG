						               													<description>Inkognito is a cooperative deductive murder mystery game where players must solve puzzles, follow clues and make decisions to solve a case. They do this using the included deck of cards, 12 hidden realistic clue documents, and the Internet. Through a choose-your-own-adventure mechanism, players make decisions that influence the course of the game and lead to solving the case in the end. One by one, they enter different realistically designed locations and encounter the various suspects. Then they choose from 3 different ways to deal with the situation and receive points based on their decisions. Complex puzzles and escape room elements must be solved in order to progress further in the case.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You're the undercover man for the F.B.I. So it comes as no surprise that one morning the bell will ring you out of bed to sneak you incognito into the maximum-security prison in Brooklyn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your task: find out who killed Liam O'Reilly. The member of a notorious New York gang was willing to work with the cops and had to pay for it with his life. But who is behind the murder? To find out, you dig deep into the abyss of the American prison system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is closely intertwined with the real world, and players have to keep using traditional apps like Google Maps or Wikipedia to gather information. Writing emails, detiallated web pages and cell phone calls are also part of the immersive gaming experience.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
