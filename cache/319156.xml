						               													<description>Say What?! The Adult Party Game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The adult party game about conjuring up clues about ridiculously disgusting cards with sneaky deceptions and challenging bids.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: 250 cards, 150 betting chips and a bottle opener to mark the correct card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Go from party zero, to party hero &amp;ndash; and reap the rewards that come along with Party Champ status.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An unsavory, nauseating and unwholesome specimen of a card game. Not to be confused with a savory, uneasy and wholesome legume.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Each player gets 10 of the sick and twisted cards, enough voting cards as there are players, and 10 green chips.&amp;#10;     On your go pick one of your cards and say a clue about the card. The clue can be anything like &amp;ldquo;This is something Dave would do.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;If my wife caught me doing this then she would probably join in.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;This card is like something from Jurassic Park.&amp;rdquo; or if you don&amp;rsquo;t have much imagination then you can just say &amp;ldquo;This is very painful.&amp;rdquo;. The clue shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too obvious or too obscure so finding the perfect balance is crucial.&amp;#10;     Place your card face down on the table. All other players then choose one card from their hand that closely matches the clue. All cards are placed face down on the table and shuffled together.&amp;#10;     All cards are then dealt face up on the place holder cards which are lettered A-F (for up to 6 players).&amp;#10;     Once all ridiculous cards have been read out it is then time for all other players to choose a letter card and bet some chips on which card you think the initial clue was about.&amp;#10;     Once all players have placed their bets with the somewhat strange betting chips the original card is revealed by placing the bottle opener on it.&amp;#10;     All players can now reveal which card they thought it was by turning over their letter card. The players that guessed the correct card win the same amount of chips that they bet.&amp;#10;     The players that guessed incorrectly have to give all of their bet chips to the player who played the card that misdirected them.&amp;#10;     The winner is the player with the most chips!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
