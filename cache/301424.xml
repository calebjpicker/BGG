Gameboard&amp;#10;10x10&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. A) It&amp;rsquo;s like a split between 2 players. So each player can put their fish, cats and dogs only on his/her 5 columns and 2 rows like an original game&amp;#10;https://monosnap.com/file/yuPN3oZoZKcyju6U5goz0RgpzbCU7x however they can reach any column on the other side to make their fish a winner&amp;#10;https://monosnap.com/file/zO7IHZRmegX3T9ob5ZErYguEMuaGM9 &amp;#10;B) Each player has 10 fish, 2 cats, and 1 dog.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Main rules:&amp;#10;-players play in teams so the winning condition is for the players to bring as much fish as possible together to the other river bank. &amp;#10;-rules for moving for every pawn are the same. So they can move across all the big boards.&amp;#10;-players take turns so If players 12 and 34 are teams then player 1 starts his first move then player 3 takes another move then player 2 and then player 4 etc&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
