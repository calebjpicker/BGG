						               													<description>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hoffman is a Master for the Guild.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Appropriately enough, C. Hoffman crews play like a machine full of complex moving parts with Hoffman as the clockwork heart of the whole amalgamation. He both grants power to his constructs and borrows their own, creating powerful synergies between himself and his metal bodyguards. His low speed is offset by his ability to catch a ride (from Drawn to Metal) with a nearby construct. Hoffman does not fight the enemy directly, instead he enhances his Constructs to fight for him even taking temporary control of them with Machine Puppet to make a Strike. But all of this power and synergy with his crew comes at a price, as he is very reliant on his crew for his success and if you are too careless with them you will soon find Hoffman stuck in the middle of the fight without anyone to help him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Naturally, C. Hoffman's synergy with Constructs makes them the best choice for his crew. The Guild offers these in the forms of the Guardian, the Hunter, the Peacekeeper, the Watcher, and Ryle. C. Hoffman's Arcanist Ties ability gives him access to the Steampunk Arachnid, Large Steampunk Arachnid, the Steamborg Executioner, Joss, and the Soulstone Miner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Minion constructs included in Hoffman's starter box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Guardian - With potent spells like Shield Wall and Protect, plus the ability to armor nearby enemies, a healing flip that can be Assimilated, and a way to keep up with the rest of the crew, the Guardian is a stellar addition for any Constructs of Order crew. His weapons include a Sword and Shield, the latter granting a damage flip (with 2 negative twists) even on a miss, guaranteeing a minimum of 2 damage when used in tandem with Machine Puppet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Hunter - With the ability to shadow speedier models, the Hunter offers a much needed independent Construct to guard objectives and chase down models. It's not going to stand up to a lot of punishment, however, so make sure to utilize Ambush when possible, and keep it at range of your foes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Watcher - It not only has an invaluable set of deck maintenance abilities, it also has some great abilities for C. Hoffman to Assimilate, notably Slow to Die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
