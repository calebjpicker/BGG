						               													<description>In Tiki-Taka: a card game, two players take on the role of opposing football managers, using player and action cards to dominate the pitch and outscore their opponent. By carefully devising a strategy around their goalie, captain, tactical style, and players, a savvy manager can outwit and overwhelm the opposition. But every great manager must also monitor the flow of the match. Play too cautiously and you risk ceding goals before your team is at full strength; play too aggressively and you risk losing momentum just as the match reaches its climax.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over four rounds of intense competition, players will go head-to-head, seeking to score more points than their opponent in each third of the pitch. Win a majority of these zones and you score a goal; win a majority and shut out the opposition completely, and you score two goals! The player with more goals at the end of the regulation 90' match (four rounds) is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players win zones via points obtained by player cards and action cards. Player cards are drawn and drafted at match start and halftime, and are placed on the field for the duration of the match. Building a team with similar nationalities and complementary strengths is the foundation to success. Action cards are drawn and drafted at the start of every round and can be played only once for their points or other effects. But crucially, these cards may also be saved between rounds, forcing smart managers to carefully conserve their strength.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Just as in real football, the very best managers must blend the strengths and weaknesses of their squad, the tactical styles of both teams, and a keen sense of momentum to exploit the opposition and lead their side to victory. Are you up to the task?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
