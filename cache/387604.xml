						               													<description>The game can be played competitively or cooperatively. Word cards are laid out in a 4X4 grid in Codenames fashion. Challenge cards come in six types. A player gives clues to his teammates to try to complete a challenge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Examples of challenges are: use a designated word in the grid in a sentence that describes a targeted word on the challenge card; use an internet meme or emoji to describe a word in the grid; use a simile or metaphor to identify a word in the grid; and draw a sketch or act out a scene that will describe a word in the grid. Discard used grid words and replenish the grid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a team has completed 4,5, or 6 challenge types (depending upon how difficult the players want the game to be), that team attempts a Final Word Duel in which one of the discarded grid words is secretly chosen, and three clues, based on a die roll, are given about the word. The clues will be to state a synonym or antonym of the word or to designate the position of a vowel or consonant in the word. The first team to succeed in the Final Word Duel wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
