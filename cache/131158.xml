						               													<description>A &amp;quot;The Little Prince&amp;quot;-themed children's game about matching and remembering shapes and colours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Background story: Antoine, the astronomer, has been talked into stealing the stars of the universe for his planetarium by the evil snake. But the stars are essential for all the inhabitants of the planets. Without their light, plants, animals and people cannot live. Help the Little Prince convince Antoine to set the stars free. Accompany the Prince and his friend, the fox, when they return the stars to their place in the universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup: The board is placed at the middle of the table. Airplane and die are set aside. The 6 snake tiles are placed on the planet at the center of the board. The outline star tiles are shuffled and placed face up all over the room. The star tiles with the filled-in stars are shuffled and distributed evenly among the players, face down. Each player selects a player character on the board and places the stack of face-down star tiles in front of themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay: The start player takes the airplane. He/she then looks at the top tile of their star tiles stack. They try to remember its colour and shape. The active player then says &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; and moves around the room, looking for the matching outline star tile. When they find it, they put it into a slit on the plane and fly back to the Planet of Astronomy. They then put the matching pair of tiles in front of them, turn over the second tile from their stack and try again to find the matching tile.&amp;#10;As soon as the active player has embarked on his/her flight, the player to his/her left rolls the die until the snake symbol appears. He/she then takes a snake tile from the board and passes on the die to the next player. The other players continue rolling the die until the last snake tile has been taken from the board. This means that the active player's flight phase is over and it's the next player's turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player has collected his/her last pair of tiles. The current round is continued until each player has had an equal number of turns. All players that only have complete pairs of tiles after this round win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
