						               													<description>Board game &amp;lsquo;ZooRegatta&amp;rsquo; is a family learning game that acquaints Players with Geography and Animal world of our planet during fascinating sailing regatta. Children will like playing process as well as preparation to the game, during which it will be necessary to assemble 4 ships miniatures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players appear in the role of captains of sailing ships that received task of particular importance: &amp;ldquo;To make a round-the-world voyage and collect animals &amp;ndash; one animal from each continent. All animals must be shipped to the own port in order to organize a zoo.&amp;rdquo; Winner is the Player, who first transports full collection of animals to the port, where his trip started.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay is divided to rounds. During a round all Players move their ships according to the turn order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Distance that can be passed by a ship is determined by each Player with a die roll.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Oceans have plenty of currents and an experienced captain can use favorable ones in order to speed up his trip over the oceans vastness. A ship that moved to a hex with a current passes one hex in a direction of a current and this movement does not decrease remaining movement points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to quickly pass large distances, desperate captain can use whirlpools (their total number is 6). In order to use whirpools, Player rolls a die, passes corresponding number of hexes and if he finishes in a whirlpool, he rolls a die once more. New number will show in which whirlpool the Player will start his new turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Player at the beginning of the game has 2 shots (so 2 fire tokens are put on a ship card). In order to fire, a Player has to finish his movement near an opponent&amp;rsquo;s ship. After that he rolls a die and result indicates a cabin, which was hit. (e.g., cabin 6 is hit in a die roll of 6). If the cabin is empty, a shot is unlucky. If an animal was in cabin, a shoot hits an animal out of the ship, and wind and waves return it to its natural living place (a captain must place an animal token to any of the empty red hexes on the animal&amp;rsquo;s continent).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SECOND GAME.&amp;#10;The board is 2-sided. On the second side of the board there is another game: &amp;lsquo;Dangerous race&amp;rsquo;. It will suit to the smallest Players that only get their first steps in a board game world!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A winner is a Player who first passes a route from a starting fort to a finishing one. Each Player rolls a die and moves at corresponding number of circles along the line. Lines are of red and yellow colors. Red solid line is a main path. Yellow solid line is shorter but more dangerous way.&amp;#10;AWARDS&amp;#10;Winner of the &amp;quot;Baby Expo Ukraine 2018&amp;quot; (best geography game)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
