						               													<description>This expansion includes new Heroes, new Creatures and Minions, and a previously unseen Witch, Skriga, and her Werewolf familiar Accalia. Comes complete with 4 new double sided map tiles that add water barriers to the game as well as 5 new Encounters for this new land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skriga paddled her boat idly. Life at sea suited her fine. Sure, there were no stupid minions to kick, but no Demons to kick her either. And plenty of fish! Leave them in the bottom of the boat for a couple of days and they get really tasty. Sea dragons would fetch the really ugly fishes from the depths, if you shout at them loud enough. Ugly ones tasted best and it felt good to push the sea dragons around. They were so full of themselves! Anything could swim. She could learn if she wanted to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Looking up she saw a storm brewing, small but close. Perfect, everyone likes a little rain in their face, trickling down their backs. She turned the boat to head towards the better weather. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;As she paddled, it became clear this was not a simple storm. Water splashed and circled in the air, the vortex moving towards her faster than she moved towards it. Then it was upon her, and everything changed. She was under the water, not on it, and her precious boat was torn to pieces around her. And it was cold, so cold. As she floated towards the dim and strangely diffuse light above her, the cold dragged her mind to a dark, silent place. And then she cracked her face against the sheet of ice above her.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trapped beneath the ice for decades, Skriga could barely be called alive. Frozen in place, she was too chilled to draw power from Neemoss but the fading tendrils of her magic could feel the dead and drowned around her, together with the rotting flotsam and jetsam that is human decay. Her slowed thoughts could imagine new spells to use her surroundings to her advantage and when the ice began to thaw, she was a new Witch. We might call her a necromancer, although she had no name for what she had become.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
