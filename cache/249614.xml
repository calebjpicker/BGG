						               													<description>Investorboss! was written by Ian McLaren and published in Chimaera (Issue 15 - Apr 1976).  This simple game was designed for postal play (play-by-mail) and cannot be converted to face-to-face play because turns require one week of real time.  At least two players are needed, though the game may facilitate any number of players (8 players is considered optimum).  At the start of the game, one player is selected as the &amp;quot;investment manager&amp;quot; and this player will execute all of the turns and make a report of results (including their own).  The game runs for a number of weeks (turns) determined at the start of play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is run by selecting any newspaper published at least once a week that carries at least some financial news and stock listings (the author suggests the &amp;quot;Financial Times&amp;quot; as appropriate).  All players begin with a &amp;pound;100,000 loan taken at interest.  Players submit one turn per week in writing, containing a buy/sell order or orders.  Players may buy or sell any number of shares they can afford in any stock, bond, or security that is routinely reported in the selected newspaper.  Players may also repay a loan, in whole or in part, if desired.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The &amp;quot;investment manager&amp;quot; player calculates a trade expense using a standard (given) formula depending on the type of security, and then adjusts the player's portfolio as appropriate.  On the weekly mark, the newspaper issue of that day is used to determine the net value of all player holdings (including appreciation, depreciation, and dividends).  The loan rate for outstanding loans is deducted, and players that are &amp;quot;in the hole&amp;quot; are forced to take overdrafts at higher loan rates (loan interest rates are fixed by the rules).  The &amp;quot;investment manager&amp;quot; player then makes a report to all players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the determined number of week (turns) has elapsed, all shares in any security are sold, all costs are calculated and deducted, all loans are repaid (if possible), and a final valuation is made for all players.  The player with the highest monetary value is declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
