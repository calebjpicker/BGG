						               													<description>BraveGuard is a rpg-inspired strategy game that captures the spirit of high-adventure in a fantasy world. Players control a Hero with unique abilities as they explore the open-world map, defeating Encounters and gaining Treasure on their quest for victory. A core set of simple rules that make it quick to get started, but multiple Scenarios to choose from allow players to either work together in a cooperative game, or go head-to-head for victory in a competitive game. This variety of scenarios provides the option of either a lighter game or one with more depth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game starts with the Heroes in central town, from there players choose their own path. The map is divided into several areas with their own types of increasingly difficult Encounters - beginning to the relative ease of the Plains, into the dense Forests further out, then giving way to the dangers of the ancient Ruins. In the furthest reaches, players will find a variety of unique points of interest, like the Great Tree or Eternal Volcano, which will be their goal for many of the unique Quests. There are also the Fallen Palaces, home to the great Fiends - the most challenging Encounter for any Hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Encounter system is the heart of most turns in every Scenario. After moving, players draw an Encounter card matching the type of space they are in. There are two options for how to approach each Encounter, each corresponding to one of the 4 stats - Combat, Agility, Magic, or Intelligence. Players must use try to determine which stat they think each option is and evaluate their various bonuses to determine which option is best for them. After deciding, you'll flip the card over to see the required stat and target number, then roll the die and add your bonuses. Win and you get a Treasure, lose and you're down a Heart. Lose all your Hearts and you must spend the next turn healing up at the nearest Camp. At any point during your turn you can choose to use one of your Hero's unique powers to help you in a number of ways.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BraveGuard was developed with the goal of being a game that offers seasoned gamers a quick &amp;amp; compelling adventure, but also offers enough clarity and lighter options to be welcoming to new gamers...young or old! At it's core the game offers choice every turn, character development, and serves as an introduction to the core concepts to help create the next generation of serious gamers!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
