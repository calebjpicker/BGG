						               													<description>Combat Leader is Minden's game series that simulates tactical level infantry combat during the Second World War.  Counters (5/8th inch) represent individual soldiers that are individually named and rated for marksmanship, morale, melee ability, leadership rank, and weapon.  The map scale is 17 yards per hex, and time scale is between 45 and 60 seconds per turn.  A variety of scenarios enables gamers to conduct firefights between individual squads.  The game was designed for two-players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Like all Minden releases, this game series emphasizes historicity and playability.  Games and modules may be freely combined.  The first two releases cover the titanic struggle on the east front, at the smallest scale possible... individual German and Russian soldiers.  The counters reflect the strengths and weaknesses of each army.  Note that players must supply a six-sided die and deck of standard playing cards to play, and the two-sided counters must be cut apart prior to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tanks?  No tanks!  The Combat Leader system is a two-player game designed to simulate tactical infantry firefights between individual soldiers and leaders in an historically faithful yet highly playable manner.  And yes... more games and nationalities for the Combat Leader system are planned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While the Combat Leader game system was designed for two players, many solitaire enthusiasts would consider it &amp;quot;solo friendly&amp;quot; since it is low complexity, there are not many units on the map at any time, and there is some &amp;quot;chaos&amp;quot; and variability built into the system (similar to other two-player games published by Minden).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat Leader: Core Rules is Minden's rulebook for the entire Combat Leader game system. It includes all standard, advanced, and optional rules to play the game. The book also contains portions of game maps and soldier counters to allow you to play sample scenarios. To fully employ these rules, it is assumed that players have access to at least one Combat Leader game, module, or game component set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COMBAT LEADER: CORE RULES is a 52-page book containing all the standard, advanced, and optional rules for the system, covering German and Russian soldiers (including rules for Green, SS, Assault Engineer, and Volkssturm squads, and commissars)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
