						               													<description>- OBJECT OF THE GAME&amp;#10;Be the first astronaut to collect the five stars of your color and land on the moon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- SETUP&amp;#10;Choose one Sky grid and lay the Picture cards in a 5 x 5 grid in the center of the table, making sure&amp;#10;to put the Moon card in the place indicated on the grid.&amp;#10;Each player chooses an Astronaut player marker and stars in the&amp;#10;matching color.&amp;#10;Copying the pattern on the Sky grid, place the Astronaut player&amp;#10;markers, the Moon marker, and the Stars of the players&amp;rsquo;&amp;#10;colors on the Picture cards. Any unused stars&amp;#10;stay in the box.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- PLAYING THE GAME&amp;#10;The youngest player starts. Play then continues clockwise.&amp;#10;The astronauts&amp;rsquo; aim is to move between the spaces, collecting the five stars of their color.&amp;#10;To move your astronaut, say a word related to the picture it is standing on and then move your&amp;#10;astronaut exactly the same number of spaces as there are syllables in the word. You cannot move&amp;#10;fewer spaces than the number of syllables.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; Astronauts can move horizontally or vertically but not diagonally.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; You can pass through or stop on a space occupied by another player.&amp;#10;&amp;bull; You cannot return to a space already passed through during your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- If your astronaut stops on a space containing a star of your color, pick up the star. If they&amp;#10;stop on an empty space or a space containing a star of another player&amp;rsquo;s color, nothing happens. Once&amp;#10;you have finished moving, play passes to the next player.&amp;#10;When an astronaut has collected their five stars, they then have to get to the Moon space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- END OF THE GAME&amp;#10;The game ends when an astronaut lands on the Moon with their five stars.&amp;#10;Finish the round so that all players have had the same number of turns: All the astronauts who&amp;#10;have landed on the Moon with their five stars during the last turn piece together their dream and&amp;#10;win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
