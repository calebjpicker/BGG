						               													<description>A dynamic game where chips are moving all the time creating fascinating bee hives!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game accurately simulates a real life beehive. The player is given a starter beehive and must plan strategically and manage the hive's resources, bee production, comb space and stores to grow the hive as strong as possible. The players must endure a chaotic and ever changing environment that is uncertain, but somewhat governed by the different seasons, diseases and man-made events.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The purpose of the game is to grow the hive and to accumulate as many SWARMS as possible without letting the hive die of starvation or run out of bees.  Bee biology and seasons knowledge will give the players an edge but luck also helps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
