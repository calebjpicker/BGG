						               													<description>Black Diamonds is a game for two to four players that covers over one hundred years of Northeastern Pennsylvania coal mining. Players take the role of mine owners who are attempting to mine anthracite, or, &amp;quot;black diamonds&amp;quot; from the rich coal fields of this region to become the most profitable mine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, players must hire miners, improve their mine and its safety, extract the coal, then ship it down a unique canal system to the market that simulates the manner in which coal was actually shipped during this era. The coal is then sold at a limited market which creates fierce competition for the most profit as multiple mine owners try to ship and sell their coal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All of this economic and transportation activity is set against a backdrop of historical events which can influence the course of the game. These include the development of the railroad as an alternate means of transportation, the great flood which nearly destroyed the Lehigh Canal, the rise of Bethlehem Iron and Steel as a major national industry that must be supplied with coal, and the rise of labor unions. During the game, mine owners walk the fine line between profit and safety, payroll, graft, and layoffs which can cause worker discontent to rise to the point that a union is formed. If the union comes to their mine, mine owners must negotiate with their workers to continue operations. The player who best manages their mine and their labor force to make the most profit will become the King of Black Diamonds!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is an original design by Geof Gambill with original artwork by Chris Cassidy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
