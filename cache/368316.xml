						               													<description>The kr&amp;auml;nzchen-sisters have decided to pay a joint visit to the kr&amp;auml;nzchen-aunt and, since they live scattered all over the world, to pick each other up in order to arrive together in Stuttgart. Whether this is successful will be determined at the destination. The journey begins at space 1 at home. At the beginning of the game, each player pays 20 tokens to the till; one or two dice are thrown in the usual manner and one advances from number to number.&amp;#10;One of the travelers is elected as chairperson. As soon as she continues her journey, she has to ask each of the people throwing the dice 3 questions about the last route covered: which countries she passed, which mountains or rivers she crossed, what curiosities could be seen, what natural or artistic products the countries contain, etc etc. Whoever answers a question incorrectly must pay a fine of 2 tokens; who misses 2 questions 4 tokens and goes back to the previous station; if you leave all questions unanswered, you have to pay 6 tokens and go back to your home town. If the chairperson is guilty of an oversight by asking a question incorrectly or failing to judge the answer, the same penalty applies.&amp;#10;If you go abroad, you will receive a travel allowance of 5 to kens from the til, but has the obligation to answer the questions in English or French. Anyone who gets close to the border or port has a one-day stay due to customs clearance and is not allowed to play the dice once. In the cities marked with yellow numbers, the passenger missed the connection; this holds the same until she is replaced by another traveler who also stops here. But on the next roll she has as many spaces to go back as the dice show eyes. In the residence cities, whereby only Berlin applies in Germany, travelers receive 10 tokens to buy a travel gift for loved ones at home. Should the till ever go bankrupt, the players are obliged to contribute 5 tokens again. Whoever arrives in Stuttgart first receives the contents of the till.&amp;#10;At the end all the players write a poem from the town where she got stuck, in which she describes the journey and the gift she bought. It happens in such a way that the winner begins with a long piece of paper and, after writing it down, folds it in such a way that only the two final words of the last two lines remain visible, to which the next one has to rhyme and so on. After the last one has finished her verses, the chairperson reads out the entire poem, which, if it is well done, may in fact be sent to the aunt so that she can see whether the dear maids have had a pleasant journey.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
