						               													<description>You have languished for what feels like an eternity in the prison of an unjust king, but today your sentence has been adjusted to fit his fancy. He has demanded your participation in a grueling set of trials against the foulest creatures in the kingdom. The deal is simple: Survive the test and the king will grant your freedom. In order to maximize the king's enjoyment, you will not be alone and you will be allowed time to prepare.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;King's Eye is a cooperative, drafting battle simulator for 2-4 players. Choose a character, draft a deck full of upgrades and equipment, and battle through 7 waves of mobs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;King's Eye is played in 2 major phases. In phase 1, players draft upgrade decks in a traditional pass drafting format using 3 &amp;quot;packs&amp;quot; of 9 cards per player from the 120 included upgrade cards. These cards improve character stats and add new abilities/actions that players will be able to utilize in phase 2. At the end of the draft, players have a 27 card deck full of exciting enhancements with which to power-up their character.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 2 is a cooperative battle through 7 waves of mobs. Each round a number of mobs equal to the number of players joins the battle, players take their turns, and then any remaining mobs take their turns. The 7 waves are split into 3 waves each of basic and intermediate mobs, followed by a boss mob wave at the end. Throughout the wave battle, players are becoming stronger and stronger as they seek to stay alive and dispatch the enemies. Once the boss mobs arrive, players have 3 rounds to clear all enemies. Any player that is still alive after all of the enemies have been defeated shares the victory, earning their freedom and the joy that comes from seeing the shock in the King's Eye.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you draw a card from your upgrade deck and choose a card in your hand to play. Then you can choose 2 actions to perform from you list of available actions.  Everyone has certain action options: draw a card, play a card, perform a basic attack. Each character, and many upgrade cards offer additional action options for players to utilize.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
