						               													<description>Attrition is designed to be played by two people. Players follow directions provided on the game board to form completed boxes and capture the most amount space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is 13x13 one inch squares (totaling 169 spaces)each with its own arrows allowing for movement of a specific direction up, down, left or right, or a combination of those movements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game each player rolls a die to determine who will place their game piece first (lower number places first higher number places second but moves first). As players exit a tile they place a marker turned to their color on the board. Players must follow the directional arrows in the spaces trying to form a completed box (2x2 or greater). Once you have formed a completed box you are allowed to move freely in that space assuming you can get to the box using directional arrows on the board. If a completed box is fully encircled by the opponents color markers the box is turned to that players markers. You may not move through an opponents completed box. If you move through an opponents marker that is not in a completed box turn it to your color (you must follow the directions of the arrows under the marker). If at any time you find that you have no legal moves you move your game piece to another location on the board and your remaining moves are forfeit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round players roll a single die and the combined roll is the movement allotment for the turn.  Players alternate first position each round eliminating the &amp;quot;first-player advantage&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when neither player has a valid move that they can take.&amp;#10;  &amp;#10;The aesthetics of the game are meant to give you that old-timey feel. From the scroll for a game mat to the stained wooden game pieces and markers, Attrition is meant to feel like a game that has been played for hundreds of years.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
