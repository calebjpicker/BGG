						               													<description>Really a card game that happens to be played with a board. A pack of 48 object cards and 48 word cards are used. 16 cards, from the object cards are placed face-down around the rim of the board (the yellow spaces), and 8 cards from the word pack are placed face-up on the central red spaces. &amp;#10;Each player has a hand of 6 cards. In your turn, you can take a card, exposed or not, the only rule being that you must replace the card taken with a like-card (a picture with a picture or a word with a word). Or you can take the top card from the picture deck or the word deck,The object is to win tricks of 2 or 3 cards. The set must contain at least one card from the objects and a like one from the words. There is a table at the back of the rules which players may consult to check their trick is legal. Any time you make a trick, say, with an apple and the word apple card, check to see if any other trick has been collected in that family, for example, another player has played a banana picture with a banana word card. In this eventuality, you may take the banana trick, giving you two tricks in the 'fruit' family. And, of course, if a player makes a trick from one family and the two other tricks of that family have already been won, the player playing the third trick may take both the other tricks. Scoring takes place after one player has the required number of tricks (the number required changes with the number of players).&amp;#10;Another set collecting game is described, called Family Triplets, in which you need to collect tricks of three cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
