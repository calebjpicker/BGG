						               													<description>Player of the Game Basketball is designed to provide a quick method of resolving a basketball game between any two teams. Where this game is truly unique is in its ability to not only provide you with a final score, but it will also give you individual point, rebound and assist totals for each player that participates in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you understand the concepts behind the game, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to play out a full game in 5 minutes for the basic game, and 7-10 minutes for the advanced game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game offers two levels of complexity. For those gamers that wish to use Player of the Game Basketball in conjunction with another basketball title that resolves games in a possession by possession manner, the basic version will more than likely provide you with all of the detail that you require. Since the basic version plays quicker, it should be a great tool for single team replayers that want to get a snapshot of the rest of the league.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The advanced version of the game is designed for gamers that wish to conduct a series, or a complete season using only Player of the Game Basketball. The advanced version will provide you with hot and cold streaks for players, as well as a realistic game pace factor that will provide you with a realistic method of reproducing the high and lower scoring affairs that occur in basketball, all with their real-life frequency. The advanced version is a great method of playing cross-era teams to see who was truly better.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will need 2 D10, not included with the game.  You use the d10 rolls to determine which players on a given team will play in a game and what his potential scoring total is.  Additional rolls are used to calculate adjustments due to defense, home court advantage and other factors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
