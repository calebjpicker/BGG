						               													<description>Split into two teams of two or more players. Shuffle the cards. The team going first has one of their players take the top card from the deck. Then the player performs the charade by miming one of the four titles on the card. Their team has a set time to guess correctly. If correctly guessed the team receives one point. If the team does not guess correctly the play goes to the second team.&amp;#10;The game ends when each teams member has performed three charades. The team with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
