						               													<description>Bring your matching game to life! In this classic game, you try to find two identical animals by uncovering them. Using your smartphone, the animals come to life on your table and move. From roaring lions to pecking chickens, the animals are ready for you to discover!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To play the matching game without the smartphone app, all you need are the playing cards. These are shuffled face down and laid out. The first player turns over two cards of their choice. If they show the same animal, they can take the cards and place them in front of them. In this case, the player gets another turn to flip over two more cards. If the cards show two different animals, they are turned face down again after all players have had a chance to see them. The next player's turn begins and they can turn over two cards of their choice. The game ends when there are no cards left. The winner is the player with the most cards at the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game with the free smartphone app follows the same rules. Instead of turning over cards, animated 3D models of the animals appear.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
