						               													<description>Quatsch! is a German language learning Party Game consisting of different vocabulary cards, Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, and a judgement die. Players shuffle the Noun and Adjective decks together, and keep the verb deck separate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns judging sentence submissions which are often nonsensical or silly. The judging player rolls the judgement die and plays one card from their hand, the other players will then create a sentence, incorporating the card played by the judging player that most closely matches the feeling of the result of the judgement die. The winning player then wins the vocabulary card presented by the judging player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players continue playing until the verb deck runs out of cards, the player with the most cards won from judgement is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
