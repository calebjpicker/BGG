						               													<description>Wortwiesel is a speed word-building game. There are three types of cards: Cards with 2 consonants, cards with 2 vowels, and cards with 1 consonant and one vowel. &amp;#10;Flip the sand timer. Players race to build words out of their cards, using as many letters as possible. Individual letters which are in the way must be covered by other cards, but no card may be covered completely. &amp;#10;Each player has four tiles with which to cover letters at the end or at the beginning of a word, and one wild card tile which can be used for any letter. These tiles can only be used once in the game.&amp;#10;When the sand timer runs out, any player can announce that they are drawing an additional card. All other players must then also draw another card. After a player shouts &amp;ldquo;stop&amp;rdquo;, the sand timer is started one last time. The other players may try to improve their word in that time. The round ends when the timer runs through again. Players mark their words on a score sheet &amp;ndash; the longer a word is, the more points are awarded. &amp;#10;Play three rounds. Deduct points for unused cards, get bonus points for unused tiles. The player with the highest combined score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
