						               													<description>Brain activity up!&amp;#10;As blocks are stacked on top of the game board, three-dimensional thinking and spatial perception are developed.&amp;#10;It develops fine motor, concentration, sense of balance, ability to observe, and problem-solving skills through block stacking.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;About the Game&amp;#10;A new level of three-dimensional Tetromino board game.&amp;#10;Shake Shake is a board game made of tetromino blocks in three dimensions. It's a family game that anyone can easily enjoy by observing block shapes and filling up three-dimensional spaces. It is a board game that helps brain development by developing spatial perception, sense of balance, concentration, and problem-solving skills through three-dimensional thinking and observation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal of the Game&amp;#10;Please remember two things to enjoy Shake Shake.&amp;#10;First, balance on the rocking plate and make sure to keep it balanced so that the block doesn't fall off. Falling blocks become (-) points. &amp;#10;Second, build a cylindrical tower and place your blocks so that  you can see the most of your blocks when viewed from above. Whoever take the most spaces at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The game is played clockwise starting with the youngest person.&amp;#10;     When it's your turn, place 1 tile you have on the board.&amp;#10;     The circular plate will shake when you place your blocks, so be sure to place them in a balanced manner so that they don&amp;rsquo;t fall off.&amp;#10;     Blocks must be placed to fill the bottom row first. If you don't have a block to fill the bottom row in your turn, you can place a block on the top row. The blank space must be filled if the next person has a block that can fill it.&amp;#10;     If no one can fill the blank space, or if the upper row block covers the blank space in the bottom row, leave it as it is.&amp;#10;     If you drop a block in your turn, get all the dropped blocks and set them aside next to you. This block counts as -1 points per piece.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of the Game&amp;#10;End the game immediately if one of the two applies.&amp;#10;First, if one person drops 3 or more blocks while placing his or her blocks : Whoever drops them will be penalized and the game will end immediately.&amp;#10;Second, if everyone placed all of their blocks they have,&amp;#10;end the game immediately and the person with the most points wins.&amp;#10;[ SCORING ]&amp;#10;Count the number of your blocks that can be viewed from above. If there is block that has been set aside after it get dropped, count as (-) for each of the blocks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play in Another Way (Puzzle)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Place the circular rocking plate on the floor.&amp;#10;     Try staking all 32 blocks to build the tower that has a flat top surface. Try making a tower with a flat top from the 2nd to the 8th floor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;         Contact Publisher&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MAGICBEANGAMES(Republic of Korea)&amp;#10;e-mail : magicbean@magicbeangame.com&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
