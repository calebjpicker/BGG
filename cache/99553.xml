						               													<description>The Shade of Zombie is a merger between game of strategy and game of letters where the player must manage eliminate the Zombies against which he is to be able to count. A slightly conventional mechanics drags the player to a combat against enormous hordes Zombies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game this one thought to receive added since they can be new cards with new values and attributes beside introducing concrete areas of game since it can be boards and scenery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It uses several systems of game of exclusive creation since it is CdB's Runic System and the System sequence to establish dynamic not cyclical shifts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of the players is to eliminate Zombies, nevertheless the game this one very modified since all the systems for which it operates have been designed separately, we will see that systems have used and his application in game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The system of shifts &amp;quot;System Sequence&amp;quot; is a system of shifts for level of priority, this is established by the value of the Zombies against which we fight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Initially of the game every player receives 2 Zombies's cards establishing by means of the sum of his values a total quantity that will be his priority of game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Procedure: maximum of 3 Zombies for player, increase of priority for the not irresolute Zombies and decrease for the irresolute Zombies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This gives like proved a different value between players and the order of the shifts decides, the system repeats itself during the whole item and this gives like proved a different order from shifts constant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player once in his shift must resort to eliminating Zombies, for this it was using a special system of so called combat &amp;quot; SEDD Runic &amp;quot; formed by 3 cards that give like proved combinations two-color on having placed in pyramidal formation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every Zombie that the player possesses in front of, includes 4 cards that in his set they form combinations Two-color, similar to the combinations obtained for BE Runic, using BE and in similarity of combinations the player ire withdrawing segments of the Zombies up to managing to eliminate them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 3 types of Zombies, the positives &amp;quot; increase priority &amp;quot; negatives &amp;quot; diminish priority &amp;quot; and puntuables &amp;quot; they allow on having played to count for the final inventory &amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once it is achieved to count, the player must study where to count since we speak about the system Faction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The system Faction is a system of punctuations for faction, this one based on a board divided by 2 different decrees, the first board that is completed is used for the final inventory. Every section can include a maximum of 10 points, nevertheless the players only possess a maximum of 6 cards to include in the board, thus the system of punctuation is established like strategically.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The system of shifts, the system of combat and the system of punctuation are 3 bases on which Zombie operates on The Shade of, his architecture has as aim be strategic for the player since on having established a correct strategy, the shifts can be extended, we can create alliances between players and can create a sequential strategy of shifts that give us mas opportunities against another player for the simple fact of creating an order of shifts based on the basic calculation of increase and level decrease of priority.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All that achieves by means of 25 cards that there includes the game that they are the technical base of all his development, whereas the rest of components alone are cards to mark condition and others both with the player and with the Zombies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It paginates of exhibition: http://cdb.creatuforo.com/the-shade-of-zombies-tema68.html&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
