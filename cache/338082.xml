						               													<description>Paradise-Opoly is a nostalgic and detailed memoir of the small mountain town of Paradise, CA that was devastated by wildfire in 2018. The games base mode uses classic monopoly mechanics and is completely redesigned and re-themed around Paradise culture, history and community. The process of whittling down what would be represented from the town involved hundreds of community members suggesting and voting online what should be included. The result is a rich and well-rounded portrayal of our little town. My main purpose in the design of the game was for it to really give someone that feeling of home when they play it, whether you are from there or not. Nearly every person who was in Paradise that day lost everything. Not only their homes, pets and even family members, but they lost their community. The town was completely changed forever in a matter of hours. My intent is to capture the spirit of Paradise that so many love, cherish and miss dearly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am not a game developer, by any means. I just had an idea, shortly after the fire, to create this game to commemorate the town. Since that idea I have learned many things and the idea has grown into a beautifully designed and well thought out game. I am currently in the middle of a Kickstarter campaign and fully expect to reach my funding goal so I can produce 3000 games. 100% of the net-profits from my company sales of the games and merchandise will be donated back to non-profits aimed at immediate rebuilding projects for lower income residents of Paradise. I intend to represent my town and help in any way I can.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game features fun, vibrant and colorful artwork and design by Traci Van Wagoner and Kurt Keller of Imagine That! Design in New York. They have done an amazing job with conveying the detail and nuance I wanted in every illustration and design. All of the metal game miniatures are custom designed by the very talented 3D sculptor, Chad Hoverter, and represent somethng special and unique to Paradise. Even the old &amp;quot;houses and hotels&amp;quot; are now Miner's Tents and Log Cabins, one of the many references to the very prominent gold rush history of the area. All of the &amp;quot;Property&amp;quot; cards contain a short story or description about the landmark or place they contain. Included is a full color information booklet with extended versions of the stories. For some playing that weren't locals or for kids who may not know all the history of their town the game serves as a fun learning experience of the towns culture and beginnings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
