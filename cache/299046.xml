						               													<description>Breaking Ball is a Sports themed game based on one of the Irish National Sports - Gaelic Football. It is a card and dice game with an emphasis on tactical use of your team players throughout a game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each team has 15 'players' in various positions throughout the playing pitch from Goalkeeper to Full Forwards. It follows the proper rules of Gaelic Football.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each team tries to win possession of the football and beat their opponent in that 'zone' of the playing field before passing the ball via various attacking cards, while their opponent tries to intercept the ball by counteracting their moves with their defending cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player gets past their opponent and successfully  moves the ball through the playing field zones into their attacking half of the field they can attempt to shoot for a point from long range (using dice, the further out harder it is to score) or they can try and work their way in to shoot for a goal or an easy point, whilst their opponent tries to dispossess them of the ball (by means of card moves). A goal represents 3 points and a point is, well 1 point! (a point in Gaelic Football is kicking the ball over the crossbar and much easier to accomplish than scoring a goal).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can get yellow carded and red cards sent off - there are star players on each team with added skills and the tactical element of how you deploy your players can have a big impact on the outcome.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Its a 2 player game (2 teams) but players do join together to manage a team against other opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tactics is a big part of the game and how you deploy your team and counteract your opponents star players will have a bearing on the outcome.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So game play follows the rules to move up and down the field as each player tries to work their way into a possible scoring zone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play in a real game lasts 30 minutes per half but players can decide a time limit. The winner is the player with the highest combined score (goals and points) at the end of the allotted time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
