						               													<description>Data Boxing is based on decades of study and research. It began as a research project in 1967 by Dr. Julian Compton (1940-2010), a Florida A&amp;amp;M humanities professor and boxing authority. The heavyweights were evaluated on up to 155 variables. The table game was first produced by Gamecraft in 1976. The computerized version was first released in 2004 which is set up similarly to the board game. The computer implementation was done by NASA programmer Don Mankowski.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Data Boxing features yesterdays legends and hall of famers reflecting the glory days of years gone by. You'll find Ali, Marciano, Dempsey, Louis, Tunney, Foreman, Frazier, Baer, Braddock and more. To quote the designer of the game, Dr. Julian Compton, from a Data Boxing Newsletter (in 1977), &amp;quot;One of the real thrills for this game player is to see the stars of the past come alive in a game structure. Usually these names will be familiar, but ever so often an unknown will rear his head in a bid for greatness.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Data Boxing is &amp;quot;the boxer's Boxing Game&amp;quot;. It's a detailed, realistic simulation of boxing where boxers of all eras are matched.  There is a real component to it because it's based on the actual performance of boxers. Individual fighters are rated on cards, and bouts are resolved through dice and charts and/or rounds cards (see Data Boxing II below). To quote Dr. Compton, &amp;quot;The game was popular with boxing writers, due to its obvious awareness of information below the headlines of boxing history, and its mathematical structure, which allowed for the matchup of boxing greats from different time periods.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Data Boxing allows you to choose the level of complexity with which you are most comfortable. To quote from the 1980 edition of Data Boxing produced by Big League Game Company, &amp;quot;Data Boxing is one of the most detailed and accurate sports games you can play. It is hoped you can find the level which will give you all the enjoyment that others have had, whether you are 6 or 96. It is a game you can play for a lifetime.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Data Boxing was featured in the December 1977 edition of Ring Magazine, the May 1977 and December 1977 editions of Boxing Illustrated, The People's Almanac [1978], Computer Sports Matchups [1981], the December 13th, 2006 issue of the Tallahassee Democrat and the BoxRec Wiki Encyclopedia. Dr. Compton co-authored The World Champion Boxing Quiz and Computer Sports Matchups. He was also a contributor to Boxing Illustrated magazine, Table Top Sports and All Sports Digest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
