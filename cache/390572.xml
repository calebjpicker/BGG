						               													<description>Ivion combines the intensity of a fighting game with the strategy of deck-building card games to create an experience unlike any other. In Ivion, your deck IS your character, and you build it from a variety of classes and specializations. Each character type has numerous cards from which to choose, along with wildly different playstyles. Mix and match them to create your own, unique character!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The ??? is a force to be reckoned with - her keen eye and steady hand make her a master archer, feared by foes and beloved by allies. From tourney to tourney, she travels the realm, winning over the hearts of the people with her exploits and undeniable charm. When the ??? commits his latest act of villainy, she knows that target practice is over. With bow in hand and arrowheads at the ready, she sets out to deliver a message the ??? won't soon forget.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;---&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE ??? has earned every scrap of power he clutches. His tactics are as slimy as they are effective - lying, thieving, poisoning - everything must be on or under the table if he wants to sit at the head of it. He didn&amp;rsquo;t write the rules; he simply realized there are none. After his most recent power grab, one of the peasantry seems to be more agitated than usual&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s nothing he can&amp;rsquo;t smooth over with one of his special glasses of wine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
