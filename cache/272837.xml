						               													<description>Introduction:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ark of Atlantis is a worker placement style board game. During each turn, players work hard to collect resources, save creatures, and find artifacts all while trying to build a ship large enough to save all of their workers before Atlantis sinks. As players race against time and each other, Atlantis continues to sink around them. Players must juggle their time between building a ship to save themselves and risking everything in order to save all that Atlantis holds dear. Players receive bonus points for risking and saving precious items from around the island before they too are lost to the sea. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Goal of the Game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to acquire more victory points than any other player. Players receive victory points for building ship sections, collecting treasure tokens, and selling resources. Players lose victory points for each worker they were unable to save at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How Ark of Atlantis Plays:&amp;#10; Players take turns placing their workers around the island. On a player&amp;rsquo;s turn they can collect resources, build ship sections, or save valuable creatures, treasures, potions, and rare books from around the island to gain extra victory points. Each time a player places a worker or a group of workers they must then move their time track marker forward for each worker they placed. In Ark of Atlantis, the turn order is constantly changing depending on where a player&amp;rsquo;s time track marker is positioned on the time track. If a player&amp;rsquo;s marker lands on or passes over an event space the player draws an event card and then resolves it by flipping over an island tile. The second time an island tile would be flipped it is removed from the game. The game ends once all island tiles have been removed. Next, players tally up their victory points by adding any bonus points or deducting points for each worker they were unable to save. The player with the most points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
