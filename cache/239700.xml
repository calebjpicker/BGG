						               													<description>Pod People from Another Planet! is a solitaire, man-to-man, science fiction, wargame where you, the player, must take your team of elite soldiers and rescue a group of scientists being hunted by the Pod People of planet P-37.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players control six soldiers as they navigate and battle through hostile enemies known as Pod People on an alien planet. Their mission? Rescue the scientists and safely escort them back to the space shuttle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game uses a modular board and a random spawn system for the aliens so that no two games are the same. The dice based combat system utilizing rating and strength will force the player to make tactical and strategic decisions throughout the game. An experience system is used so that as the battle rages on, soldiers will learn and be able to modify results later in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win the game, successfully escort at least one of the scientists back to the space shuttle. If at any point all of the scientists or all of the soldiers are killed, then the game is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pod People from Another Planet!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The human race realized long ago that in order to survive, it must leave its planet and populate the galaxy. The humans of the time understood that Earth wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be around forever, and it would become uninhabitable long before it ceases to exist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It had been nearly 800 years since the first branches of humanity reached for the stars. In that time, the human race had become fragmented as colonies were established along the way. One such fragment was scouting a new planet that long range scanners indicated would be suitable for colonization. Protocol dictates that identified planets must be scouted by research teams before any attempt at colonizing is initiated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Research teams consist of various scientists who determine whether or not a planet is suitable for long term colonization and soldiers who protect the scientists from unknown danger. The soldiers have an important job, because scientists are valuable. Without the scientists, the expeditions to colonize new worlds would be halted, and training new scientists is a difficult task.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Research of this particular planet, coded P-37 while still being scouted, was promising. P-37 appeared to meet all the requirements to initiate the terraforming stage of colonization. One of these requirements being that the planet could not be already inhabited by conscious life.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While nearing the completion of the research stage of colonization, something went wrong &amp;ndash; terribly wrong. Reports of ambush started to arrive from research teams around the planet. One by one, the teams were being wiped out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scientists began to identify the attacks as psionic in nature, having encountered other alien life forms over the past 800 years with similar abilities. Utilizing this knowledge, some scientists were able to barricade themselves behind a psionic force field while the brave soldiers guarding them sacrificed their lives to buy the scientists the time to complete the fortification.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scientists knew the force field would only last a week &amp;ndash; maybe two. They also knew their own value. Rescue teams would be coming for them, and when they were rescued, they planned to bring with them valuable information. They focused their research on the unknown aliens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What they discovered was both fascinating and horrifying. The aliens, whom the scientists started to refer to as Pod People due to the pods they emerged from, were not themselves conscious beings. There was indeed a consciousness on P-37, but the scientists failed to identify it in their previous research. The consciousness was the planet itself. The Pod People were being spawned by the planet as an extension of its own consciousness in order to protect itself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;            &amp;#10;        &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your team of elite soldiers and others like it have been ordered to carry out rescue missions to bring these scientists home. You have been briefed on the knowledge related by the scientists on the surface and fitted with gear to help you fight the Pod People. You will land your space shuttle near the location of one of the barricades, locate the scientists, and escort them safely back to the shuttle in order to bring them home.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
