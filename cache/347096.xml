						               													<description>This fun party game is the perfect alternative to rich chocolate gifts. Instead of sugar-sweet calorie bombs, the recipient gets an exciting game of tile-laying in which the aim is to create the most exquisite bouquets of chocolates and give them to his or her fellow players. But watch out: To become a true Ma&amp;icirc;tre Chocolatier and win at this game, you need a watchful eye, a gift for combination and a clever mind. This is the only way to create the most gifts of chocolates and emerge as the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner here is the player who was able to give away the most boxes of chocolates to his fellow players at the end. To assemble the perfect selection, you must follow the instructions on your order cards. But beware: you need imagination, a good eye and a lot of dexterity to create the perfect chocolate variation.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;At the beginning, each player receives order cards on which certain praline arrangements are depicted. The players now have to reconstruct these on the moving playing field, following 4 swapping rules. Once you have completed an order, the order card is gift-wrapped and you may give it to one of your fellow players.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;When one of you has given away his last order card, the game is over. However, the player who finishes first does not automatically win. It is much more decisive to whom he has given his praline creations - and whether he has also received plenty of gifts from the others. So it remains exciting for everyone until the points are counted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
