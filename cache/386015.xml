						               													<description>In Waddle Waddle, you play the role of a Penguin Scientist, specializing in a particular Penguin Species. Your job is to study penguins as they leave the Ice Floe and travel to their nesting grounds in the Antarctic region, called Rookeries. There&amp;rsquo;s safety in numbers, so penguins travel in groups called Waddles. As a Scientist, you tag Waddles, scoring Research Points for each Waddle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Waddles that contain Mating Pairs make Nests. Score extra Pesearch Points at the end of each Breeding Season if you tag the most Nests in a Rookery. You also get player-specific bonuses when you tag the Nests of the Penguin Species your Scientist specializes in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each penguin is represented by a Penguin Card with a number indicating its pecking order in the penguin social hierarchy. Only compatible penguins will travel together. There are six different Penguin Species that each like to&amp;#10;nest in different places. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to carefully choose the Penguin Cards from the Ice Floe to score the most Research Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Food is scarce! There is a limited fish supply at each Rookery. It costs one fish to play each Waddle. You might need to send penguins on a Fishing Trip to find more fish. And finally, beware of Predators that appear each Breeding Season and make it harder for Waddles to land at each Rookery. The player with the most Research Points at the end of the game earns the title Top Researcher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
