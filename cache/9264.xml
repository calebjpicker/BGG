						               													<description>This is one of the many TSR rules Booklets published during the mid-1970s. My copy is a 2nd print run dated 1975, but these rules were first printed in 1974. Note: there is NO mention of D&amp;amp;D products listed YET in the back page although the REST of their product line is. I mention this because in my 1975 2nd edition of Jedko's &amp;quot;the African Campaign&amp;quot;, they list DUNGEON! as a part of their product line. TSR later on packaged some Jedco(new sp) games releases under their company logo which became the Wizard symbol.&amp;#10; This Rules Booklet has 50 pages including their Select Bibliography, 3-Musketry Tables(Point Blank, up to 6&amp;quot; distance, up to 12&amp;quot;) with from 1-50 figures firing for each &amp;amp; uses a single 6-sided DIE, an Artillery Roundshot Fire Table, an Artillery Cannister Fire Table, a Melee Results Table, a Terrain Effects Table, &amp;amp; a Constructions Effects Table.&amp;#10; An INDEX lists the contents for this Booklet which are as follows: PART-1--Introduction; 1.Time/Distance/Troop Organization Scale; 2.Movement Trays; 3.Basic Units; 4.Formations; 5.Orders; 6.Sequence of Operations; 7.Movement; 8.Musketry Fire; 9.Melee; 10.Morale In General; 11.Morale due to the Accumulation of Casualties; 12.Artillery; 13. Terrain, Construction &amp;amp; Impedimentia; 14.the Infantry Square; 15.Dragoons; 16.Visibility(optional rules limiting visibility); 17.Appendix to the Rules A: Table of Elites; 18.Appendix to the Rules B: Nomenclature of the Five Major Power Armies.&amp;#10; PART-2--National Characteristics: 1.Introduction to National Characteristics; 2.Rules Reflecting N.C. in the game: the French Army; 3...the Russian Army; 4...the Austrian Army; 5...the Prussian Army; 6...the British Army; 7...the Minor Power Armies.&amp;#10; PART-3--Organization: Introduction to System of Organization--1; 1.Major Power Infantry Organization; 2.Major Power Cavalry Organization; 3.Major Power Units; System of Organization--2: 1.The Grande Armee of France circa 1812; 2.The Russian Army circa 1812; 3.The Austrian Army circa 1809; 4.The Prussian Army circa 1813; 5.The British Army circa 1805-1815; and a variety of Minor Power Armies including Spanish, Polish, Dutch, Italy, Naples, Westphalia, Bavaria, Saxony, Berg, Hesse-Dornstadt, Wurttemburg, Neuchatel, Nassau, Baden, Denmark, Sweden, &amp;amp; Hesse-Casse. The only thing lacking is the numerous and voluminous Uniforms colorings associated with this era. Osprey publishing has made an entire industry with just this Historical era although they do produce lots of books for many others as well.&amp;#10; Overall, a well detailed depiction of Napoleonic warfare which can be scaled to your liking from individuals to entire Armies if you prefer.   &amp;#10; Note: The 1974 first ed. has the Gygax/Kaye Logo on the cover instead of the lizardman holding a staff. It does have D&amp;amp;D products listed in the back page along with the rest of their product line.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
