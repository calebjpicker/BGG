						               													<description>INCURSION is set in the world of Secrets of the Third Reich and is the ultimate combination of board game and miniatures game. Armored troopers of the US &amp;ldquo;Lucky Seventh&amp;rdquo; and stalwart commandos of the United Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s MI-13 hurtle through underground bunkers and combat the monstrous forces of the German SWD in a furious race against time. The Doomsday Device is ticking and neither the Allies nor the Axis can fail. This two player game features a tight storyline campaign that culminates in an epic and desperate climax. The game mechanics are simple to grasp allowing players to instantly focus on their tactical options. Game play is incredibly fast-paced and tense and players choose their forces through a card-based Requisition Point system. The game is played on a board with a special card deck and highly detailed 30mm metal miniatures. You can also use the miniatures in games of Secrets of the Third Reich. Rules can be found for them here.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 1946, after stunning German victories on both fronts largely attributed to Vergeltungswaffe 4, a compound that kills painfully and resurrects corpses as dangerous animate objects, Franco joined the Axis. Spanish forces backed by Brandenburger commandos and Fallschirmjager Drop Armor assaulted the British held rock of Gibraltar. Germany claimed the ancient fort with its network of caves and aggressively expanded it into a vast underground research, command, and control center, plumbing the depths of the Rock. In 1949, allied forces mount a massive offensive to retake it. The campaign is bloody and hard-fought but ultimately successful. German and Spanish personnel escape by U-boat from underwater chambers. US and British forces enter the German compound only to be beaten back by the horrors that lurk within the vast twisted labyrinth under Gibraltar. Many commanders feel that the only recourse is to seal the caves from the surface, so that is done. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the lo cation of all of the undersea tunnels. Zombie naval mines damage or destroy numerous smaller vessels and sink the aircraft carrier Lexington as they sally forth from these undersea caves. MI-13 stumbles onto communiqu&amp;eacute;s detailing German SWD plans for a diabolical Doomsday Device under Gibraltar. Given the effectiveness of previous SWD attacks, the credibility of these reports cannot be ignored. The decision is made to clear the caves. MI-13 Commandos and elements of the US Lucky Seventh invade the stronghold in a desperate race to shut down the Doomsday Device before it can be deployed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rigid two piece box covered in art&amp;#10;Glossy 28 page rulebook&amp;#10;Card rules summary/playsheet&amp;#10;4 sheets of two-sided heavy-duty die cut pieces (132 total) including counters, doors and stand-ups for all models&amp;#10;Super Heavy duty two-sided six-fold game board&amp;#10;86 cards (66 card Battle Deck and 10 Model Cards for each side)&amp;#10;3 black dice&amp;#10;36 black plastic stand-up holders for doors and &amp;quot;models&amp;quot;&amp;#10;Vac-formed plastic holding tray&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
