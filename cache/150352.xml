						               													<description>In the not too distant future the world is ruled by massive corporations that wage war with each other over the control of empires. Literal wars fought by private armies proved to be overly costly in resources, profits, and public opinion, so the Wolf &amp;amp; Phoenix Marketing Conglomerate introduced an out-of-the-box way for corporate entities to resolve their differences: The Hostile Takeover Arena. Corporations that have reached an impasse in negotiations can avoid expensive, lengthy legal battles or risky sabotage by simply hiring a team of trained warriors to out-maneuver the competition in a quick, bloody, ratings-exploding spectacle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Hostile Takeover, players control a mercenary team trying to outwit and outgun the competition. Each Character has strengths and weaknesses that must be wisely used to gain the upper hand. Can you lead your team of mercenaries to victory amid the chaos of battle?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hostile Takeover is played on a modular board (usually 30&amp;rdquo;x30&amp;rdquo;) filled with 1&amp;rdquo; Squares. Force fields and other terrain features are placed on the board to simulate a sci-fi battle arena. Players each use their team of 4 mercenaries to accomplish scenario specific objectives that earn them victory points. The first player to earn enough victory points (determined by scenario and number of players) is the winner. Each scenario is specifically designed to bring all teams together in a flurry of combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each Round players select an Action Card (Move, Melee, Fire or Aim/Overwatch) for each of their unwounded characters. Players also assign 4 Energy Tokens to their characters. Energy Tokens are used to boost the characters in a variety of ways and also enable the use of each character&amp;rsquo;s unique Special Action. Players then roll for Initiative. Finally, players go in Initiative order activating 1 of their characters. This continues until all characters have acted or become pinned or wounded. There is a quick Clean Up step at the end of the round and then a new round begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ranged and Melee Combat checks are handled by rolling 3d6 and trying to equal or exceed a given target number. Each Character has a chart describing their ranged and melee weapons that quickly and easily provides the target number to roll against based on a variety of factors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
