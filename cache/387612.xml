Using these resources they are able to brew potions at the end of each turn. The first player to brew 3 potions is the village hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The competition element of the game is found in the fact that only the topmost ring around each pole is considered as the winning ring. Therefore, players have to make constant tactical choices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can also try to capture the black pole in the middle of the game board.
