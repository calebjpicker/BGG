						               													<description>Llama Drama is a family weight card game where players are trying to shed their hand.  The base deck allows for 2-4 players, and combining two decks allows for up to 8 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup:&amp;#10;Deal each player three cards face-down, three cards face-up, and five cards for their hand. Leave the remaining cards face-down as the Draw Pile. Leave some space on the table for a Play Pile and a Discard Pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How To Win:&amp;#10;The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How To Play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SETUP&amp;#10;Deal each player three cards face-down, three cards face-up, and five cards for their hand. Leave the remaining cards face-down as the Draw Pile. Leave some space on the table for a Play Pile and a Discard Pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO WIN&amp;#10;The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;Choose a player to go first and rotate clockwise. They can play any card to start the Play Pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, you must match or beat the top card of the Play Pile. You may play more than one of the same number or face card on your turn. Higher numbered cards beat lower numbered cards. Special Llama cards have their own rules. You can find these rules on the cards themselves or on the Llama Hierarchy instruction card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If four cards of the same number or face are played in a row (either in one turn or over consecutive turns), the Play Pile is discarded and the last player plays again. When the Play Pile is empty, a player can play any card to restart the Play Pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of a turn, if you have fewer than five cards, draw cards from the Draw Pile to have five in your hand. If on your turn you can't play a card, pick up the Play Pile (yes, the entire Play Pile) and add it to your hand, ending your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special Rule:&amp;#10;Four cards of the same value played in a row discards the current play pile from the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game End:&amp;#10;Once the Draw Pile runs out, your objective is to get rid of all of your cards. Once your hand is empty, you must play your face-up cards. If none are playable, choose one, and add it to the Play Pile. This pile will become your brand new hand! Yes, you have a hand again. Aren&amp;rsquo;t llamas fun?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you pick up cards, you must finish the cards in your hand before you can play your face-up cards again. Once you play all your face-up cards, you must attempt to play your face-down cards, without looking at them. If the card you flip fails, you must pick up the Play Pile with that card, ending your turn. You must once again finish the cards in your hand before you can play your face-down cards again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to finish all of their cards wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Card Types:&amp;#10;Numbered Llamas -  Numbered Llamas can be played on themselves, lower number llama cards and some special llama cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Baby Llama -   The Baby Llama can be played on any card.  The next player can then play any card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shy Llama -   Shy Llama can be played on any card other than Big Llama.  The next player can then only play Numbered Llama cards 1-4 or other special llama cards other than Big Llama.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Big Llama -   Big Llama can be played on any card other than Shy Llama.  The next player can then only play other special llama cards other than Shy Llama.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Magic Llama -   Magic Llama can be played on any card.  It discards the play pile and allows the player to play a second card, thus starting a new play pile with any card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ghost Llama -   Ghost Llama can be played on any card.  It is invisible and acts like the previous card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
