						               													<description>Lets face it, trolls are a bit grumpy and usually don't get along well with others. Fortunately for this group of disgruntled trolls they happen to be quarreling in a field full of boulders. In Me Throw Rock players play the role of trolls who happen to be in the thick of an argument that can only be settled by throwing large rocks at each other. The player who has the best accuracy wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Me Throw Rock is an eighteen card dexterity game where players throw a set of six double sided rock cards at target troll cards over a series of rounds. Every round a single target troll card is thrown onto the floor. Each player takes a turn throwing their own colored rock cards at the target card until all their cards have been thrown. The player who has the majority of three rock cards that are the closest to the target wins the round. The winner of the round collects the target card and any of the three closest cards that are showing the split side up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The games ends after all five target troll cards have been collected or if a player has one or less rock cards to throw. After the game has ended the players must tally their points by looking at the cards they have collected. Each target troll card collected scores three points and each rock card of the players color scores one point. The player with the most points wins the game. Ties go to the player who has collected the least number of rock cards of their opponents color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Me Throw Rock is designed to be played on the floor with a space of about 8 to 10 feet in length. However, Me Throw Rock is not limited to play on a floor and can be played on any surface with a suitable flat target area such as a table or bed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
