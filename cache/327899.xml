						               													<description>Start an adventure in the jungle to find Winzul's treasure.&amp;#10;Pick one of eight characters that have landed in a remote island.&amp;#10;You need to find precious stones and use them to enter the chamber of the treasure.&amp;#10;There are multiple dangers on the way, however characters can get stronger.&amp;#10;You can also act against other players and rob them.&amp;#10;You can buy items to aid you in the trip.&amp;#10;If you get all precious stones and open the gates that protect the treasure, Winzul's treasure will be yours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to get to the center of the board with enough precious stones to open the threasure.&amp;#10;The board consists of a set of locations (about 70) distributed in the jungle, which are connected to each other by paths.&amp;#10;There are 6 different stones, and which and how many are needed to win, is randomly determined secretly picking up a card at the beginning of the game.&amp;#10;The stones are randomly placed (as face down tokens) in the jungle.&amp;#10;If you find a precious stone, you need to remember where you found it (there are about 70 different locations each with its token!), since you cannot take the token with you (you have a map you can write notes on to remember).&amp;#10;If and when you reach the center of the board, you need to correctly uncover the location of all stones (if you make a mistake, you lose a turn and must reach the center of the board again).&amp;#10;The players throw two dice (movement and gold) which determine the resources they gain and how much they can move in their turn.&amp;#10;The movement is step by step (as part of each move you look what is hidden under the token at the location).&amp;#10;Some tokens contain objects you can pick up to make your character stronger, others, actions, encounters with enemies, events (described in cards you pick up from the events deck),...&amp;#10;You can also collect and place obstacles to make it more difficult for other players to move around the map (i.e., you can place a big boulder, which can be removed if you have a pick axe to free up the path).&amp;#10;In order to take shortcuts (special red paths) you need to fight an enemy (picked up randomly from the enemies deck).&amp;#10;When you fight enemies, you throw three dice whose sum is compared to the enemie's force (to decide if you win or lose the encounter). When you win, you get rewards; if you lose you get a &amp;quot;skull&amp;quot; token.&amp;#10;You can also fight other players if you move to their location, to try and take one of their items.&amp;#10;If at any point you accumulate 4 skulls, you lose the next turn (and start again without skulls).&amp;#10;Whoever is first to reach the center of the board and correctly uncover their target precious stones wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
