						               													<description>Player of the Game Tennis is much like our other games in the Player of the Game lineup. It plays rapidly, but offers enough detail and action to give you the story of the match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Player of the Game Tennis, each player is individually rated for their service game both first serves and second serves; their complete ability when receiving (again how they handle the opponent's first serve or second serve); ability to hit game winners or game losers in some cases. Other factors, like a player's fitness, whether he is a favorite, ability to handle adversity, major and minor injuries are all included. Did we mention that all of the factors above are broken down by playing surface? All aspects of a tennis match are covered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Player of the Game is easy to learn and easy to understand. You'll be playing in no time. Each match will unfold in front of your eyes at a brisk pace. A full match in Player of the Game tennis take no longer than 10 minutes. Most matches will be completed in 5 minutes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The base game includes a fictional Men's Tour and a fictional Women's Tour with complete schedules, prize money, a points system, and even tournament brackets. Everything needed to play is included in the base game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you want to add real players, you can purchase any of our season year books.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If your favorite player isn't rated (which isn't likely), we give you a method to put them in the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Printed game features all players on die-cut cards printed in vivid color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Step on the court today, it is all Aces with Player of the Game Tennis!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
