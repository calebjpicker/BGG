						               													<description>A new set for the classic trick-taking game Wizard, now playable by only two players. This deck includes 36 cards and some new rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3 cards are set aside at the beginning, and one of them is turned up to establish the current trump. The remaining cards are divided in 3 groups of 11 cards; each player takes one, and the remaining one forms the dummy deck. Three cards are turned face up from the dummy deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players bid on how many tricks they think they will take in the coming hand. Next the first player plays a card from their hand, then a card from the dummy's hand, and then the second player plays a card. The trick goes to the first player who played a Wizard, or by the player who played the highest trump, or to the player who played the highest lead card. Jesters always lose. The dummy player may win a trick, and in fact its role is to help the first player winn or lose a trick as needed.  The player who won the round becomes the first player and starts the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When players run out of cards, they check their bids and score. You score for making your bid exactly, and lose points if you did not make your bid.&amp;#10;This version also has a special card that cancels the trick in which it is played - no one scores that trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First player to score 100 points is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
