						               													<description>Dungeon Realms is nothing that is a card game for 2 players using deck-building mechanics in conjunction with the placement of workers, among others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dungeon Realms, you play the role of an adventurer, inexperienced and novice of his hometown, eager challenges and adventures. Gradually, as the protagonist of the story, you have to explore (and plunder) with courage and bravery the region, facing many dangers and unimaginable adventures, thus gaining experience, reputation and social status and progress level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Revive with courage, vigor and courage all the excitement of the adventures of an adventurer, palace intrigue and danger firsthand, and first-person protagonist of the adventures of an adventurer, bizarre, drunken and quarrelsome, in an exciting fantasy medieval district where they meet and are home to a multitude of stories, legends and fantastic tales.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Defy fate reaching for his sword, looking great treasures, and thieves' loot evil creatures, make the most powerful collection of magic items, descended into hell, look ultratumbas in ancient underground cities, check city distant dwarf king Aquil&amp;oacute;n , conspires palace, enjoyed in the company of your own Stag Tavern in between quarrels, hookahs and spicy wine bottles, performs missions for the king or for the thieves guild, save princesses and kill dragons. Only fame or death awaits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are a adventurer who tries to gather enough money and experience to become the next champion of the mark. Of course, you depend on the work of others to get the needed experience. You start with a set of 9 cards (6 of them are money, which give you 1 gold coin each and 3 cards to get 1 experience points (PXs)). Each round you draw 5 cards from your deck and use one card for the turn order to place your workers (adventurers marks). The workers go to the different building places in the Village to buy new cards for you (go and solve adventure), get experience or different other actions. Each turn there is one more space, where you can place your workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also there is a Line of Events with 6 cards (quest and events representing), which you can choose to buy and each round the empty places in this row are filled from a deck of cards divided into 3 different &amp;quot;Ages&amp;quot; (the last two ages cost more gold coins).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends in different ways: when a player reaches 100 px, or one player kills two dragons, or when no cards sufficient to fill the Line of Events.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
