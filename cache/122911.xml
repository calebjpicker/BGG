						               													<description>The marketplace (&amp;quot;tori&amp;quot; in Finnish, &amp;quot;torg&amp;quot; in Swedish) of Vaasa (&amp;quot;Vasa&amp;quot; in Swedish) was a vivid trade center in the 1930's, to which people from the surrounding countryside came to sell their goods. Townsfolk frequented the marketplace and various goods traded owners.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The war had its impact on the nation in the 1940's and there was shortage in food as well as other products, which lead to that the range of goods was reduced in stores as well as in the marketplace. Trade in the black market became usual especially when the ration cards were taken into use. The nation recovered in the 1950's and the belief in the future got the trade started once again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game the players try to accomplish various tasks and bring goods from the market stands to the stores located around the marketplace at the same time as they are looking for the missing whistle of the marketplace guard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game the players receive rewards for accomplished tasks, such as new skills, which allow them to move on to more difficult tasks. However, the life at the markeplace is not that easy. Good and bad crop years, the rising population, the war, economical success, the belief in the future and different events in the society have their impact on the prices and the players' possibilities to carry out tasks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is an exciting and educating game for 2-4 players, in which local history and the memories of the elderly townsfolk of Vaasa are interwoven into an innovative boardgame.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board has two sides, one easier and one harder. The game is suitable for both young and more mature players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
