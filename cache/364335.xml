						               													<description>Deep in the Amazon rainforest, a small people live on a rocky plateau, far from any civilisation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Only a huge climbing vine - called Pi`i Pua by the inhabitants, the &amp;quot;climbing flower&amp;quot; - connects their village to the ground.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every year, a group of young hunters is sent into the jungle to hunt. Who will be the first to climb the climbing vine that leads back to the village and thus receive the honour of asking for the hand of the chief's daughter?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim is to play the cards as well as possible in each round and to reach the home village as quickly as possible. In the process, however, attention must also be paid to other people, because everyone wants to climb the mighty climbing flower first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How do you climb the vine?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everyone gets a certain number of cards in their hand at the beginning. The rest become the draw pile. The starting card is placed in the middle of the table, the target card four edges above it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When it is your turn, you choose from one of three possible actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When climbing, you place a card from your hand on edge against the vine and move up as many spaces as indicated on the card (or even less).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can jump over your climbing opponents, but you must never be on the same field.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Make sure that at least one transition fits, otherwise you might have taken the wrong turn ...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you decide with the second option that you would rather just explore the area, draw a card from the draw pile and move one space further.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a last option, you can also cut the vine. To do this, you take a card from the draw pile into your hand. Of course, you only do this if there is no one on the card at the time. In addition, another card must not completely lose the connection.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you are on a card with a flower during the game, you can perform two actions in your turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can use a beetle card to replace a card that is already on the table, which then goes under the draw pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You cannot cross over beetle cards, so use them cleverly to block each other's way. By capping them, you can always use them somewhere else.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first of you to reach one of the target fields has not only earned the respect of the entire tribe, but may also ask for the hand of the chief's daughter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
