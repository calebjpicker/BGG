						               													<description>In Draft Poker, players draft cards and score points. Each card in the game has a letter and shows scoring conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players each contribute a card from their initial hand to a tableau of scoring conditions which is at first hidden. The scoring cards are shuffled, and then one is revealed.  Players then keep 3 cards from their hand and pass 4 to a neighbor. Next, a second scoring card is revealed, and players pass 3 cards. Then, a third scoring card is revealed, and players pass 2 cards. Lastly, a fourth scoring card is revealed, and players pass 1 card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then, players score the 7 cards in their hand based upon the scoring tableau.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
