						               													<description>This game is based in London in 1890, and the player is setting up a department store.  The store consists of a number of departments, which each need to be filled with stock.  Customers come to the store with a list of items that need to be bought.  If all items are sold by a single player's department store, then that player wins that customer.  If the customer still has items remaining to be bought, then they move onto the next player's department.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is mainly a card-based game, where customers, items to be bought, and departments are represented by cards, and stock is represented by small wooden cubes.  On a player's turn, they can choose a customer from 3 available customers, who each have a number of items that they want to buy, the number of which are decided by the roll of a dice.  Only the number of items to buy is visible to the player, not the actual items themselves, so it's only when the customer is chosen that the items are revealed and the player knows what can be sold.  Players receive money for items sold, which can then be used to buy new stock or new departments at the end of their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game relies on players choosing the right departments to set up, depending on what other players have already chosen, and deciding which departments should get restocked and at what time, especially when money is limited.  A player wins by being the player with the highest number of customers that had all items sold during one turn.  There are bonus points available for having the majority of customers in each family of customer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game contains 70 cards, 50 wooden cubes, 1 dice, 45 &amp;pound;1/&amp;pound;2/&amp;pound;5/&amp;pound;10 notes and a rule book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
