						               													<description>Buddha is a trick-taking game in which players bid the number of tricks they think they can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. Bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under. This is why a good balance of winning and losing the tricks is important.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Buddha uses a 70-card deck that consists of:&amp;#10;four suits Element cards (Air/Fire/Water/Earth) numbered 1-14, &amp;#10;five Yin cards [a Yin card never beats a card], &amp;#10;five Yang cards [a Yang card always any numbered card], &amp;#10;two Yin-yang cards [can be played as either Yin or Yang cards],&amp;#10;one Buddha card [beats all the other cards except the Black Hole card],&amp;#10;one Black Hole card [nobody wins the current trick].&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game lasts six, five, or four rounds depending on the number of players: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;    In a six-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 14, then deal each player 11 cards, you should have a 66-card deck to start with,&amp;#10;    In a five-player game, deal each player 14 cards, &amp;#10;    In a four-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 12-13-14, then one of the Yin cards and one of the Yang cards, then deal each player 14 cards, you should have a 56-card deck to start with,&amp;#10;    In a three-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 11-12-13-14 , then keep one of each of the special cards, deal each player 15 cards, you should have a 45-card deck to start with.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whoever has the most points after six (six-player or three-player game), five (five-player game) or four (four-player game) rounds wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each round, all players take a look at their dealt hands, then simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out their fists and on the count of three, revealing a certain number of fingers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads an Element card, then all other players must follow the same Element, if possible. If a player leads a Yin card, then the second player determines the Element led. If a player leads a Yang card, the Buddha, or the Black Hole card, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases, a player may always play an unnumbered card, even if they hold cards in the same Element led.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matches his/her bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, he/she scores 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player misses his/her bid, he/she loses 10 points for each trick that he/she was off, whether it's more or fewer than predicted. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, he/she scores 20 points if successful, plus he/she wins points equal to the highest bid made times 20, if he/she misses their bid, he/she loses 20 points for each trick he/she takes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whoever has the most points after X rounds, wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
