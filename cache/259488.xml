						               													<description>This game consists of 5 little games which can be played as a tournament one after each other, where the player with the most points wins or each game as a single game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Didi Hallervorder is a famous German comedian, actor in funny films and moderator e.g. from &amp;quot;Hidden Camera&amp;quot;. This game is a party game. Didi is known to participate for each joke and this is the reason written in the rules why his name is in the title and his image is in all games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The games:&amp;#10;1. Pinch the Didi (Zwick' den Didi). A spinning circle is in the middle and a path for a kind of race. The players pinch their little clothes peg at the edge of the spinning circle.&amp;#10;At all positions there is an action e.g. move 3 fields, suspend 2 turns.&amp;#10;These actions are executed, normally moving forward your figure on the path.&amp;#10;After the round 1 or more players reach the finish line this game ends. The points each player gets are written on the path.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Didi listen (Didi horch einmal):&amp;#10;5 little balls: 4 empty and 1 with stones in it.&amp;#10;1 4 part puzzle showing Didis face for each player. &amp;#10;The active player takes all the balls in his hands and tries to hear which is the stone filled. Each player who is right gets 1 piece of his 4 piece puzzle. Who has finished first gets 5 points all others 1 point for each piece.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Didi eats chinese (Didi i&amp;szlig;t chinesisch):&amp;#10;Feet a Didi figure with your chips using chopsticks like in China. Game ends when 1 player has feet all his chips. He gets 1 bonus point. Each player gets 1 point for each of his chips Didi has eaten.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. Jiggle Didi (Wackel-Didi)&amp;#10;There is a jiggling figure of Didi in the middle of the table. Each player tries to get rid of his chips by placing them on the hat of the Didi figure. If chips fall down, the player gets them. The player who has placed the last chip on Didi wins this game and gets 1 point. Each other player gets 1 point minus for each chip he still has.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5. Didis gymnastic party (Didis Party-Gymnastik)&amp;#10;There is a start and finish sign. These are placed in 4 m distance.&amp;#10;A stack of cards is shuffeled. Each of the cards shows a kind of gymnastic figure. The actual player opens the top card. This shows how to hold the arms and feets and where to place chips on the body for his run. With this positions the actual player tries to transport as many of these chips without that they fall down. Each chip which is still in place at the finish gives 1 point. The rules do not mention how many rounds this game is played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing with more than 4 players you have to build teams.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
