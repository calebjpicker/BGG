						               													<description>After a long captivity you and your companions have an opportunity to recover freedom. You are imprisoned in a spaceship abandoned by your captors. You were abducted to be exhibited in a traveling alien circus, but now that the ship is about to become uninhabitable, your kidnappers have simply opened the cells and fled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kenophobia is a game of exploration and survival of 2 to 4 players with a duration of 40 minutes.&amp;#10;Each player will lead a group of five abductees through the corridors and compartments of the ship. The objective is to drive them to some of the exit locks before they lose all air or are self-destructing. The abductees must explore the environment to find the most direct route to the center of the ship, where the vacuum suits that allow them to leave it. Along the way, they can investigate, looking in the compartments for equipment that will help them achieve their goal.&amp;#10;They will soon discover that they are not alone. Other victims accompany them in their race for salvation. But they can not expect any help from them. Their appearance is mutually repulsive and there is also fear. The fear of the vacuum of space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME: to draw the maximum number of units equipped with a vacuum suit through one of the four locks of the ship before the air runs out (when no more exploration tiles are left) or before the ship is self-destructed (when the countdown reaches the last turn).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player can perform a maximum of two actions during his turn.&amp;#10;Each of the 5 abductees that manages can only be activated once per turn. That is, each unit can only perform one action per turn. The units can act together or alone.&amp;#10;An abductee activated by the player can perform one of the following actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Explore box in white&amp;#10;     Move on ship and explored shippacks&amp;#10;     Investigate ship sticker&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
