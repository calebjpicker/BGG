						               													<description>The baseball game which spans the entire history of pro baseball.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Features Every pro team from 1871 to the present is rated. All players, regardless of their playing time, are included. All batters and pitchers are individually carded. Each batter is rated for: Overall batting ability, propensity to get on base, to strike out, to hit into double plays, to hit singles, doubles, triples &amp;amp; homers, to draw walks, to be hit by pitches, to attempt base steals, and base stealing success. Each batter card also gives the number of games the player appeared in along with the team stint. This is included for those of you wishing to conduct realistic player transactions during a season. Each pitcher is rated for: Overall pitching ability, propensity to keep runners off the bases, to give up hits, to walk batters, to strike out batters, to throw wild pitches, to hit batsmen and to commit balks. Each pitcher card also included the number of games the pitcher appeared in, along with the number of games he appeared as a starter. As with the batting cards, a team stint number is also included.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each team has its own fielding chart, with each position player listed, along with the positions he played, the number of games in which he appeared in that position, his error rating for that position, and his throwing arm rating (if he is an outfielder.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unique control system controls the flow of the game. You will get a visual picture of the batter/pitcher duel as each at-bat is conducted. The great hurlers will generally control the game, but a weak batter will surprise the ace at any moment!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fast action cards included, ready for printing. You may print them 1 or 2-sided. Additional game charts include out charts, extra charts and missing data charts (for those years where statistics were not available.) Game playing time is about an hour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
