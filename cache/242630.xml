						               													<description>Make a trip back in time to the eighteenth century and play the role of the butler of the Marquis of Pombal in the management of the Palace and his farm. Important visits are to arrive ... Are you ready to receive them?&amp;#10;This board game is not meant to be a simulation of reality but rather a game that provides fun, healthy living but also the Palace as a historical and cultural monument.&amp;#10;It also focuses some of the farm's old activities and also draws attention to the beauty of the building, its Gardens, the Cascade of the Poets, the House of Fishing, the wine and olive oil mills.&amp;#10;The characters in this game are historical figures that have crossed in a way or another with the Palace, but the main figure is the Palace itself. Since chronological data were not taken into account, these characters may not have been simultaneously in the palace.&amp;#10;Sebasti&amp;atilde;o Jos&amp;eacute; de Carvalho e Melo (Marquis of Pombal) was in his Palace in Oeiras, more precisely in the Fishing House, enjoying his precious leisure time when he finds out that his butler had shuffled his agenda. Some important visitors are coming to the Palace but no one knows who or when will arrive first...&amp;#10;The player will play the role of a candidate for the new butler of the Marques. He will have to lead a team of workers in the preparation services of the respective places to properly receive visitors.&amp;#10;The workers are in the Staff House and will be paid for their services.&amp;#10;The attention will be focused on the locations where the visitors (characters) are welcomed. The player has to perform some maintenance and services but will also have to explore Farm's resources (Olive, Grapes, Mulberry / Silkworms) in order to produce olive oil, Carcavelos wine and silk cocoons.&amp;#10;It is necessary to produce in order to generate money (exportation through Lage Creek), and at the same time to be a good host to your visitors (characters) so that the player can be rewarded with the characters&amp;rsquo; favors (special actions of the characters) in order to get the highest score to win the game.&amp;#10;O Pal&amp;aacute;cio do Marqu&amp;ecirc;s (The Palace of the Marquis) is a worker placement board game for 2 to 4 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
