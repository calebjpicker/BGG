						               													<description>Theme:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gem Hunt is an open-world, adventure tabletop board game for 1-4 players. Set out on your trek as one of 12 unique Gem Hunters. You travel across the board which contains a diverse number of regions and locations that have unique opportunities and dangers as you set out to complete your quests and become the Master Gem Hunter!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Quests are unique jeweled items that contain specific numbers and types of faceted gems and pearls and have a monetary value once all the components are collected and turned in at the jeweler&amp;rsquo;s.  There are 50 unique quest cards that can consist of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, topaz, opals, and various pearls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rough gems and pearls are obtained on unique locations on the board. Rough gems need to be cut into faceted gems to count toward completing your quest. There are some other opportunities to acquire gems and pearls in the game which gives players the opportunity to take a chance on finding an alternate means towards their goal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gem Town is the central hub of the island nation of Pacifica, which contains various locations visited throughout the game.  The island also has a mountain region, jungle region, and desert region; which are interconnected and accessible via rope bridges.  Each movement space visited requires the player to draw a fate card which can be beneficial to the player or a dire challenge.  There are 100 unique fates and 240 fate cards in total.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of each game the players decide whether to play a game based on completing the most quest cards in a specific time frame (first to achieve a specific total value in completed quest cards) or a speed round, which is the first player to complete one quest card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gem Hunt uses a turn-based, card drawing, and die rolling game system. Every turn has a movement phase and an action phase. The movement phase can consist of crossing a rope bridge, taking a ferry, taking the underground railway, taking a ride on a zip line, or moving on the board on one of the regional movement spaces. The action phase can consist of mining for gems, digging for oysters, cutting rough gems into faceted gems, performing transactions in the appropriate location, turning in completed quest cards, playing one of the mini games, or drawing a fate card after landing on a regional movement space. There are certain situations where additional movement or actions can be taken on your turn but those are detailed within the instructions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
