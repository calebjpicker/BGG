						               													<description>A deck of cards, with an erotic theme, with an associated game. It has no resemblance to Manara Game but is more like a two player-in-a-group Dixit with sexually explicit art.&amp;#10;All players should ready a scoring pad were all the names of the players of their opposing gender are noted down. This is a boys vs girls game! The cards have 5 different backsides and are sorted in 5 piles. The active player picks a color and draws 2 cards. The opposing player also picks 2 from the same pile. The active player picks a card from the two (s)he drew. Sitting across from each other, both players make eye contact and, without speaking or gesturing, try to communicate the card the active player picked. Afters some time, both play their card. If it matches, both get 5 points. If not, they get a second chance, and if it matches now, they can earn 2 points. If it fails again, they receive 0 points. After every person has played with every other person of the opposite gender, the game ends. Points are added up, Winner (per gender!) who has the most. The &amp;quot;Winning couple&amp;quot; is entitled to act out one of there cards that gave them 5 points if the play group decides to vote for it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
