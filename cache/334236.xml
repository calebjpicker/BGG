						               													<description>Some 619,636 Canadians enlisted with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the war, and approximately 424,000 served overseas. Of these men and women, 59,544 members of the CEF died during the war, 51,748 of them as a result of enemy action. The CEF served with distinction at Neuve-Chappelle, and at 2nd Ypres in 1915 they made a legendary stand to hold the line during the first gas attack on the Western Front. Posted to the Somme in September 1916, the CEF fought the sanguinary battles for Mouquet Farm and Courcelette, taking the 2nd German line that was an objective of the failed 1 July attack. Posted back to Arras in 1917 the CEF finally cracked the defenses of Vimy Ridge in a brilliant attack, which had defied both the French and British for the past 2 years. Posted back to the Ypres area in the fall of 1917, the CEF was tasked with taking Passchendaele in October and November, in appalling weather.   This was the final push to that town that had been an objective since August. In abysmal weather the CEF finally captured it in November 1917.  In 1918 the CEF was in the forefront of the great offensive that ground down the German army in the west, in fact, the 2nd Canadian division advanced past Mons on 11 November 1918 to finish the war where it had begun for the BEF 4 long years ago.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All of these battles were hard fought affairs, where no quarter was asked or given. Now, with this latest GWASL module you get to see if you can match the exploits of this fearsome fighting force on some of the most pitiless battlefields of World War I.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ownership of ASL-RB, GWASL 1 and all preceding GWASL modules required to play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scenarios:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Cheers For The Living - Bellewaerde Ridge, Belgium, May 8th 1915&amp;#10;     High And Dry - Ypres, Belgium    WW1, June 2nd 1916&amp;#10;     Kitchener's Wood - Langemark, Belgium    WW1, April 22nd 1915&amp;#10;     A Cane And A Lionheart - St. Julien, Belgium, April 23rd 1915&amp;#10;     Gravenstafel - Gravenstafel, Belgium    WW1, April 25th 1915&amp;#10;     Courcelette - Courcelette, France, September 15th 1916&amp;#10;     Sanctuary Wood - Hooge, Belgium, June 2nd 1916&amp;#10;     The Pimple - Vimy Ridge, France, April 10th 1917&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     4 Geo Boards&amp;#10;     8 scenarios in color format&amp;#10;     368 die-cut counters - The Canadians&amp;#10;     Color 3-hole rules sheet&amp;#10;     Color cardstock folder style wrap.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
