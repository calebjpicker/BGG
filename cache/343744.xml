						               													<description>Boardgame following basic rules and theme of the Card Game Kleine Fische.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;25 randomly drawn cards, which are either fish cards or cave cards, are laid out face down on a game board. The aim of the game is for the players to score the most points by collecting fish and treasure.&amp;#10;The players diving through the sea, starting from the boat adjacent to the playing field, which can be moved as first step. The diver (players figure)can always move to neighbouring fields, but must keep to the swimming direction. As soon as the diver reaches a fish card, he uncovers it and decides whether to stop or continue swimming.&amp;#10;If he continues to swim, the next fish card must be turned over. You have to stop your turn as soon as a fish type is revealed twice. You then lose both of this type.&amp;#10;There are also caves to be explored. You need to uncovered as many fish as the number on the cave card indicates, before exploring it. If this is successful, the diver receives the advantage of the cave card.&amp;#10;As soon as you end (freely or forced to), the 2nd phase is carried out. In this phase, the octopus is moved depending on the number of octopus symbols on the revealed fish cards. As soon as the octopus lands on a field with a diver, it tries to steal a fish from the diver. This is done like in the origiginal card game by a setting a number of cards and rolling a dice from the active player. In case of success (equal or higher the number) the octopus robes this number of cards for the active player. With a -1 he loses 1 card, which he has to give to the robbed player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The active player now gets all cards which are open.&amp;#10;The places are refilled from a stack. The game ends when this is not possible for all empty fields.&amp;#10;From the fish cards only the highest card from each fish type counts. The points from the treasure cards and from the fish cards are added. &amp;#10;The player with the highest points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
