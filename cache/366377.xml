						               													<description>Life as an Ant is a competitive strategic game in which players compete to establish their colony of ants as the dominant local ant force.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consist out of modular boards that can be placed in a number of different ways at the start of the game to create a unique game board for each time you play. Each player has a nest or home base, and a number of starting ants. Resources are evenly distributed over the board. There is also 3 decks of colony cards, each consisting of various different types of ants. Lastly there are a set number of larva tokens set on the game board (dependent on the number of players in the game). The goal of the game is to be the first colony in bringing back 4 larva back to the colony and guaranteeing dominance of your colony over all the ants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, players take turn to take up to 5 resources from the board, these resources can be used to purchase colony cards from on of three decks. These cards represent one of 6 different ant types and is kept in the players hand. Once per round a player may play a card in their hand and place a matching ant type hexagon tile on the board in a continuous path from their nest towards any of the larva tokens. The player who completes a unbroken path towards a larva first, may carry the larva token back to its nest and continue their path towards the next larva. While players with long routes can easily cut off other players from larva and control a large playing area, there are mechanisms that keep all players in the game until close to the end. Players may attack each other with warrior ants and even play a highly valuable flying ant and steal a larva right under the nose of another.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once a player returns their 4th larva back to the nest, the game ends and the player wins, becoming the queen ant to rule them all!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
