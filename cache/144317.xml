						               													<description>From directions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The box represents the mining fields of the Klondike.&amp;#10;Put the nuggets into the lower part of the box through any of the mine openings and place the mine covers on at random.&amp;#10;The players decide which shall commence the game and also the number of ounces of gold to be found to constitute the game as 50 ounces, 100 ounces, 200 ounces, etc.&amp;#10;Shake the nuggets in the box.&amp;#10;The first player takes a &amp;quot;pick axe&amp;quot; and lifts up any mine cover he chooses. If a nugget appears underneath lying wholly or partly within the circle covered by the mine cover, the player has to his credit the number of ounces stamped on the underside of the mine cover and he&amp;#10;also has another chance to lift a cover and so continue until he finds a mine with no nugget, at which time he looses his play. &amp;#10;The second player to the left follows and so on throughout the game.&amp;#10;If more than one nugget is found at one time under a mine cover the player places to his credit as many ounces of gold as there are nuggets times the mark on the cover.&amp;#10;Leave all the nuggets in the box and shake them up between every play. Any player can shake when another player is not actually lifting up a mine cover.&amp;#10;The player which first gets the number of ounces of gold agreed upon at the beginning of the game, wins.&amp;#10;Implements:&amp;#10;6 mine covers, 6 nuggets, 1 pick axe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
