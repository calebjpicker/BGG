						               													<description>Think Go Fish, with a classical art theme and deeper strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start the game, players are dealt four cards face down. The remaining cards are placed face down into a draw pile. On a player's turn, they ask another player if they have an artist card (e.g do you have a piece by Van Gogh?). The player they're asking then has two options. They can either say yes and give the other player their Van Gogh cards, or say no, either truthfully or in an attempt to bluff.  As this game involves bluffing, if a player does not believe their opponent is telling the truth when they say they do not have a card by the named artist, they can challenge their opponent. If their opponent did have any cards by the named artist, the opponent loses a turn and has to give all cards by the named artist to the person who challenged them, and the person who challenged them takes another turn. If the challenge fails, the person who made the challenge must give the person they challenged all their cards by the named artist and the turn then passes to the left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player builds a complete collection (four cards by the same artist, by artists from the same country, in the same genre, or by female artists), they place those cards on the table face up, these cards form your collection. If when doing this a player runs out of cards in their hand, they draw four new cards from the draw pile. Play continues until the draw pile is empty and all cards are placed into collections, or no more collections can be formed from the cards left in player's hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, players add up the value of their collection, taking into account any end game and wild card bonuses. The player who has the most expensive collection wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
