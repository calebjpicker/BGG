						               													<description>ABOUT THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TagOn&amp;reg; is a Bible-based, family-friendly crossword board game that provides instant fun for everyone! You've played crossword games before, but never like this! It enhances your Scriptural knowledge and promotes learning of the Bible. It provides an excellent way for families and friends to have meaningful fun while strengthening their knowledge of God's Word.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TagOn&amp;reg; is a game in which two to four players score points by playing and tagging Bible principal words from individual letter tiles. Words are played across or down in crossword fashion and must appear in a Bible dictionary, Bible Concordance or Bible Research Guide adopted by the players as the game dictionary. The game dictionary may be a hard copy print edition, online edition or mobile phone app. It may also be a searchable online Bible or its corresponding mobile phone app. With your game dictionary, you have set up the stage for fun!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What makes TagOn&amp;reg; unique and interesting? Through suspenseful action and thoughtful play, Bible books, characters, utterances, lands and genealogies of Bible characters as well as events and scenes of Bible times are dramatically revealed. What a game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To have fun, learn and to become the person with the most point for playing and tagging Bible words.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE PLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The play of the game involves finding, playing, connecting and tagging related Bible words. Played words may have a direct connection with existing words on the game board. This game is about remembering what Bible words were said, who said them, who were related to those characters, where the words were spoken, and in which Bible book can the words be found.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will have opportunities to obtain extra points by playing Bible words that have a direct scriptural relationship with other words [tagging words] or/and by playing words on specific colored squares marked with Bible books, characters, utterances, lands and genealogies on the game board. The revelation of Bible characters, places, events, utterances and genealogies, combined with the tag word challenge makes playing TagOn&amp;reg; a fun and interesting game for the entire family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What about playing new words by replacing existing letters on the game board? You have to see the game rules and actually play the game. Different Bible stories or events appear in every play of the game. This game is so much fun you&amp;rsquo;ll want to play until God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom comes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
