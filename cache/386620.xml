						               													<description>A collection of 3 math games to encourage fun and help with learning mathematics. Working with guidelines for Key Stage 1 &amp;amp; 2 these games will help children develop skills in addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, whilst maintaining the enjoyment of a card game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: &amp;#10;87 number cards [numbered 1-10, colored purple or yellow]&amp;#10;13 Golden Ticket cards&amp;#10;4 playing pieces&amp;#10;2 dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The games are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Charlie's Golden Ticket: Five golden ticket cards are on the table, and each player starts with one number card. On their turn a player draws a number card, and if they can combine the numbers in their hand to equal a golden ticket card, they claim that card.  The 5 table cards are replenished when they run out, and the first to get 4 tickets wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Charlie's in a Spin: The number cards are laid out to form a spiral playing track. Players start their pawns on the start card. On their turn they roll a die, move that many spaces, and say what the product of the new card's number and their die roll is; if incorrect they go back. The first to reach the center card by an exact roll wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Closest to Zero: Players start with 2 cards in hand. Yellow numbers are positive, purple numbers are negative. Players can request an additional card up to 3 times, then the player whose cards total closest to zero wins a golden ticket card. The first to have 4 tickets wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
