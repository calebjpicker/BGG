						               													<description>Greenrock Village: A small town never rests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the series of murders was finally cleared up in the local municipal theater, it seemed as if the community would be able to go about their daily business without worries. But that shouldn't last long, because a new horrific series of murders interrupts the short period of calm. Who murdered the owner? Was it Mrs. Kunz? Or Mr. M&amp;uuml;ller? Someone is up to mischief in the allotment gardens. In each of the five gardens there is an object that could have served as a murder weapon. Owners and visitors visit these gardens at different times. But one of them thinks less about gardening or relaxing...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Who will expose the killer? This game for one person with a total of 50 murder cases requires criminalistic skills and a good nose, because the 3 different levels of difficulty are a tricky task for amateur detectives. Who accepts the challenge so that the murders in the allotment gardens finally come to an end?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Match, puzzle and find the killer. Choose one of the 50 cases (these are marked in three levels of difficulty) and use the clues on the card to put the pieces in the right order. So you end up with an accurate picture of who the killer is. This game is just right for all hobby detectives, brain joggers, riddles and riddle friends and can also be taken with you on trips thanks to the practical packaging.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
