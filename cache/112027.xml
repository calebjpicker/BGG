						               													<description>CLIQUE : The Card Game&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to CLIQUE, the game of ruthless popularity. You play as that most terrifying of creatures, the pretty, popular, teenage girl. The goal is simple, to accumulate enough popularity to take over the Clique and rule the school. You accomplish this by gaining the things all girls need for societal domination, The Car, The Look, The Gear and the ultimate accessory: The Guy. But your opponents, the other girls in the Clique are out to stop you with that most powerful and destructive of weapons: Gossip. Is that Look So Last Season? Is your new Car actually Used? Is your new Guy Secretly Gay? Get all four Acquisitions, free yourself from the vicious Gossip, and you can take over the Clique.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mechanics&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The deck breaks down like this:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6 Avatars - These are the girls, each with a unique look and style.&amp;#10;6 Looks - From Goth to Ghetto Fabulous.&amp;#10;6 Cars - Will you go for Classic or Import?&amp;#10;6 Guys - If Jock is not to your liking, how about Vampire Chic?&amp;#10;6 Gears - Do I go for the Jewelry or take the Dog?&amp;#10;24 Gossip - Hand Me Down? Late Bloomer? Cruelty in card form.&amp;#10;30 Specials - Remove Gossip or dramatically alter the game.&amp;#10;50 Status - 10, 20, or 50 point cards to measure your popularity.&amp;#10;And so we come to gameplay. I'll try to keep this simple. The players set what level of popularity they need to reach in order to win. Each turn you play from your hand to try to get Acquisitions (The Gear, The Guy, etc.) for yourself. Each one gives you 10 points each round toward that goal. But the other players can put Gossip on them. While an Acquisition has a Gossip card on it, it earns you nothing. Of course, turnabout is fair play, so you'll be attacking them with the same vicious rumors. The first to earn enough popularity while having all four Acquisitions in play with no Gossip on them takes over the Clique and rules the school.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Along the way, there are also unique cards to, for instance, prevent Gossip being played on your Car (My Daddy Owns A Dealership). It possible that everyone might lose their Guys in one fell swoop if someone should play Smoking In The Boys Room. The game can change dramatically from turn to turn. But isn't that the way with high school popularity? One day you are the queen, the next you are the outcast. Same goes for CLIQUE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
