						               													<description>In Trash Talk, you and your fellow raccoons are trying to communicate with one another through the medium that you know best: trash.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the first round of play, three word cards are revealed, and each player (or team) secretly assigns the same three objects to these three words. These objects come from an assortment of odd items included in the box. Does the plastic plant best match the word &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dream&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;sharp&amp;quot;?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once both sides have locked in their choices, reveal the objects. If you match all three objects, put those cards aside, add a fourth object, lay out new cards, and play another round; if not, try again with three new cards. If you fail again, you lose the game. If you successfully make your way up to matching ten objects with ten cards, you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
