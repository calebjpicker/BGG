						               													<description>CONTEXT&amp;#10;At the beginning of the 20th century, capitalism and the nation-state are in full swing, workers have it hard: Working conditions; Work time; Wages; Unsanitary housing; everything systematically leans in favor of employers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yet since May 1, 1886 and the Haymarket Massacre, workers have tried to organize and resist, supported by a new generation of increasingly committed anarchist and union activists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scenario of &amp;quot;Which Side are you on?&amp;quot; takes place in New York, during the winter of 1910-1911 and stages homes of workers who try to survive and organize themselves to take control of the means of production before the employers become too powerful. It takes place between two events revealing the working conditions of textile workers:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- On November 25, 1910, a fire occurred at a four-story factory in Newark, New Jersey. 25 factory workers, mostly young women, died.&amp;#10;- On March 25, 1911, exactly four months after the Newark event, a fire engulfs the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building, occupied by the Triangle Waist Company, causing the death of 146 workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Which Side are you on?&amp;quot; is a historical and cooperative survival game that simulates the struggle of the workers in New York between the years 1910 and 1911; for their survival; against employer offensives; for the control of the means of production.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Workers pose and resource collection mechanisms allow for a fluid game; and a system of elements with their historical context, which facilitates immersion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game will particularly appeal to players who like adversity, cooperation, immersion, History ... and perseverance!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY&amp;#10;1-A game lasts 10 turns. Each turn, the bosses carry out offensives through cards drawn at random. These cards establish temporary or permanent mini-rules against players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2-You will be playing a family or a small group of people living together. Each member is one of your &amp;quot;workers&amp;quot; and has one action to perform per turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3-Each turn, you send your &amp;quot;workers&amp;quot; to the Tiles of New York in order to: a / work and be paid in order to pay your rent, your food and the expenses of the struggle; b / work in political places to cause agitation, strikes or sabotage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4-Then, you will use agitation, strikes and sabotage to fight the bosses offensives against your rights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5-With the added agitation, evolve the New York Tiles to make them more worker friendly; complete 6 objectives and take control of the means of production BEFORE the bosses take control of everything and even leave you enough to survive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6-Be careful, each turn you will have to draw: a / misfortune cards which will make everyone's life even more difficult; b / incident cards which will strike the player who will have the most Risk (obtained according to the work), Police Threat (obtained by causing agitation) OR the least healthy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;7-You could end up with workers in prison, injured, or sick. Which will lower your possibilities for your next turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO WIN&amp;#10;1-Victory: Take control of New York's means of production by purchasing 6 objectives with your resources.&amp;#10;2-You lose if you fail to pay the cost of your living or if the bosses reach turn 10.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
