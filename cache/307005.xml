						               													<description>Bahn Frei is a dynamic and strategic cooperative boardgame with a contemporary setting in the German railway system. The story is about 1-4 train conductors (players) taking on the lead of German train operations for two weeks. Their challenge is to provide an excellent traveler experience in order to win the game and permanently get the job and fame of running the company.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of 15 rounds. Each player is the conductor of his/her own train and cooperates with the other players to pick up and deliver passengers to their destinations within the time frame indicated on their tickets. The number of passengers that show up each round is determined by dice and event cards bring along specific challenges. Players need to cooperate and discuss very well in order to plan each round, identify the best strategy and transfer passengers where possible in order to avoid complaints. The special dynamics of the game pick up speed when all players make their moves simultaneously within 30 seconds. At the end of the round passengers being delayed leave the game and complain if you cannot manage to smoothen the situation with vouchers. The game is lost when 8 or more passengers have complained.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every gameplay is unique and influenced by different factors. Add-on variants included are&amp;#10;(A) 8 passengers who need &amp;quot;special treatment&amp;quot;&amp;#10;(B) every train has a different super-power that can be used&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note to everyone who does not know about German trains: Most Germans tend to complain about their railway system all the time. Everyone you approach will have a disaster story at hand about delays, cancelled trains, trains stuck on the track over night etc. They measure the service of the trains by high quality standards, globally known as &amp;ldquo;Made in Germany&amp;rdquo;. Therefore, most Germans will have an emotional attachment to failures on trains and will find themselves in one of the stories brought into the game through event cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
