						               													<description>At the end of the century, we brothers are suffering from food shortages and have decided to live by eating only sweets &amp;mdash; but sweets are limited as well, so let's make the best of it by going halfsies. Can we do that? With me possibly getting slightly more than half? After all, when the mountain of sweets has run out, whoever has the most sweets wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In &amp;#227;&amp;#129;&amp;#157;&amp;#227;&amp;#129;&amp;#174;&amp;#231;&amp;#148;&amp;#183;&amp;#227;&amp;#128;&amp;#129;&amp;#231;&amp;#143;&amp;#173;&amp;#230;&amp;#150;&amp;#135;&amp;#232;&amp;#153;&amp;#142; (That Man, Going Halfsies), players start with a deck of 76 cards, with the values ranging from 0-8, along with a few 11s, and with the numbers 2-4 appearing most frequently. Shuffle the deck, then place ten cards on the bottom of the deck at a 90&amp;ordm; angle from the other cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For the first turn, the active player (&amp;quot;elder brother&amp;quot;) reveals the top card to all players, then takes that card in hand along with three other cards. The elder brother then splits the cards into two face-down piles, offering one pile to a younger brother (the player on the left) and keeping the other pile. If younger brother accepts the split, the elder brother places their cards aside in a scoring pile, then the younger brother takes their pile into their hand, draws cards to fill their hand to four, then becomes the elder brother and offers a split with the brother on their left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the younger brother doesn't accept the split, then reveal the cards in the two piles. If the elder brother kept the larger share for himself, then you get to split that elder brother's share in half, discarding the larger half (if you can't split it evenly) to punish him for being unfair. If the elder brother's share was only a single card, then discard that card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If, however, the elder brother had split the pile evenly or favored the younger brother, then the younger brother's pile is split in half or discarded as punishment as described above. The elder brother keeps their share, then retains their role as elder brother, with the next player in clockwise order taking the role of younger brother. The elder brother reveals the top card, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you start drawing from the ten cards that had been turned 90&amp;ordm;, continue play until the player to the right of the first elder brother has either received a share in the role of elder brother, or doubted what was given to them, then resolved that situation. Everyone then tallies their points to see who collected the most sweets!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
