						               													<description>Ever since its discovery, magic has been a source of conflict accross the Realm. Over time, factions have used it to tame the elements of their land, repel invaders and conquer enemies. When war finally erupted, the world was plunged into darkness for decades. Peace seemed unattainable until leaders agreed on the foundation of the Magic Council, a committee in charge of legislating the use of magic across the Realm and prohibiting it during warfare.&amp;#10;To elect members of the Council, a representative of each faction was sent as their champion to compete in a tournament called Arena. In this tournament, champions used all their magic powers to battle each other in an epic clash. The winner claimed the throne of the Magic Council, while the others were assigned a title proportional to their performance. Arena became a tradition and remains to this day how members of the council are elected every year.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tales of Arena is a 3-round arena skirmish game. It can be played by 3 to 4 players.&amp;#10;To start the game, each player is assigned a champion and a map is set in the arena. Each round starts with a market phase where players provide their champion with gear. Then, players unleash their champion&amp;rsquo;s magic powers to defeat each other during the arena phase. Fortunately, champions can not die in the arena. When they are drained (0HP), they are removed momentarily but come back their next turn by their starting gate. This is made possible by the soul pool, a device that can exchange souls to save champions. It has a finite number of souls though, so when it is emptied, the round ends and Victory Points are given to each player. A new map is then set, and players can further equip their champion during the following market phase. After three rounds, the player with the most Victory Points wins the game, and as such their champion wins the throne of the Magic Council!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
