						               													<description>In Daggers High, you play an overworked high school student who will do anything to get into the best university in the nation. Unfortunately, only one student will be accepted. Manage your grades, social life, and influence with teachers to gain resume points. The player with the most resume points at the end of the game wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players begin the game with 4 Freshman event cards, and draft them. In a two-player game, the players will draw 6 Freshman event cards and discard 2 of them. Then, the players take turns playing cards from their hand. The card's event occurs. Then, the player gains a number of action points. Each action point can be spent on one of the five actions. Players can socialize to gain friends that can be used to purchase club leadership, granting an immediate and yearly bonus as well as Resume Points. Players can also study to gain one of four stats that can go towards test correcting a class, another action. Correcting a class to an A provides a teacher influence bonus as well as resume points. A player can also chat with one of eight teachers to gain teacher influence with them. This influence can be spent on a special ability or on gaining a recommendation letter that is worth a significant amount of Resume Points. Finally, players can relax to reduce their stress. This is important because a high amount of stress will cause breakdown, resulting in lower happiness that increases stress at the end of every year, and a detention that causes a loss of Resume Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players also manage secret goals in the form of Essays. Each player is dealt two Essays at the beginning of the game, and can complete them at any time to draw an additional essay. All essays are worth points at the end of the game. At the start of Junior Year, players may also elect to take the FUN, a standardized test that costs Stats to take. The FUN result is determined by a die roll, and can result in a large resume point bonus, or nothing at all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
