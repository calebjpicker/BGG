						               													<description>Along a course marked by pylons in front of a huge grandstand built especially for the event, &amp;ldquo;the Thompson&amp;rdquo; was the greatest aerial contest of its time. Pilots raced to their planes from a starting-gun's signal, flew off from a standing start, and then raced at speeds of hundreds of miles an hour, scores of feet above ground. The roar of the aircraft's engines were hardly drowned-out by that of the crowds as they witnessed aerial duels in which planes and pilots were pushed to their limits and sometimes beyond.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;September's Eagles is a low level, fun to play game on the Thompson Trophy Air Race of 1929-1939. Players use cards to activate their planes and pilots, and to stymie (Trump) the moves of their opponents. Play is very interactive, intense and true to the history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The colorful counters represent all of the major aircraft of the period, and pilot cards portray the famous aviators. In more detail, the game includes 36 different planes, from the first race winner (the Travelair R 'Mystery Ship') to the iconic Gee Bee R-1 and Roscoe Turner's 'Gilmore'. Planes are rated for endurance, turning radius, ability to climb or dive and speed. Thirty-three different pilots are represented, including pilots such as Jimmy Doolittle, Steve Wittman and Howard Hughes. Each pilot is rated for his skill level and fatigue. A deck of 54 Action Cards are used by players to move and maneuver their planes as well as rallying their planes and pilots. Players may also play cards on other players to disrupt their game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game of September's Eagles comes with a full color and extensively illustrated Rules of Play booklet. In it is a comprehensive example of play to assist in learning the game. Along with the Rules of Play booklet comes a Racing Program which allows for the gaming of all the Thompson Trophy Races starting with the first in 1929 through to the final one in 1939.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
