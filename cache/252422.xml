						               													<description>These expansions were offered as part of the Gold Level pledge for Alhambra: Designers' Expansions Box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Handymen by Stefan Feld:&amp;#10;Each player gets a number of helpers in their color at the start of the game. Every time a player chooses to take money as their action, they may also roll 3 six sided dice. With these dice the player forms a result by adding and/or subtracting each die to the result.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the result corresponds to a building number in his Alhambra, he can place a helper with the victory point side up on that building. Only one helper is allowed per building. With each scoring the player gets as many victory points as the biggest area of orthogonal adjacent helpers in his Alhambra. The helpers stay till the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the result matches a building number on the building market the player places a helper next to one of the 4 building spaces with the +1/-1 side up. Next time the player wants to buy a building from that space he can adjust the purchase price by +1 or -1 to make it easier to match the exact price. Once he buys a building of that space he returns his helper to his supply.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Use your helpers to get the most points during scoring while also making it easier to get your desired buildings from the building market.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: 48 handymen tokens and 3 dice&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gates Without End by Michael Rieneck:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The expansion will feature hexagonal tiles, with six bonuses, one on each corner of the hexagon. Bonuses will include victory points, the ability to switch buildings in the market, or tokens that can be tie breakers for certain building types.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One of these bonus tiles will be placed next to an Arcade (the brown buildings) whenever one is added to the market. When a player buys the arcade, they take the bonus tile as well. Then, they orient the tile such that one bonus points at themselves. Each player will receive the bonus that is pointing at them immediately.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fresh Color by Macel S&amp;uuml;&amp;szlig;elbeck &amp;amp; Marko Ruskowski:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's time to decorate! With the Fresh Color expansion players decorate their buildings with ornaments, mosaics and fresh colors to gain even more victory points for their buildings during scoring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game each player gets a decoration board that holds the decorations for each of the 6 building types. Additionally a common task board is placed next to the building market. On it the different decoration tiles are placed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every time a player overpays for a building he can either claim a decoration tile from the board and place it on their decoration board, or get colors. Which colors the player gets is determined by the board and with what money type he paid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each decoration tile shows what kind and how much of certain colors is needed in order to build it. Once a player has all the colors needed for one of his decorations he can, as an alternate action in his turn, build it. Each finished decoration awards 2 extra victory points for each corresponding building in the players Alhambra.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents: 6 player task boards, 1 common task board, 18 task tiles, and 36 color tokens&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
