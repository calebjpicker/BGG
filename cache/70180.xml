						               													<description>From the publisher web site:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Innovation Planner(TM) is a card set of innovation strategies and solutions used for rapid, effective, and efficient problem solving and idea generation. It is based on the Ideation TRIZ innovation methodology that was derived from the analysis of over 3 million patents and 500 standard patterns of technical evolution.  Just as you can combine the 26 letters in the alphabet to produce all ranges of literature, these cards describe the universal principles of invention that innovators combine to create the millions of inventions known to mankind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can use Innovation Planner(TM) for systematic innovation planning, brainstorming, or to play one of several innovation games.  Use of this product as directed leads to the creation of new and patentable inventions.  Inventors from using organizations have filed for dozens of patents inspired by the ideas on these cards, making these cards worth exponentially more than their weight in gold for the owning organizations.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;See:  http://www.innovationplannercards.com/.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Innovation Planner represents a set of cards to aid in brainstorming.  The publishers also provide simple rules for two games, Solve It(TM) and Evolve It(TM), that utilize the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the games, a problem to solve is selected by players.  Players are dealt cards.  Each player plays a card on their turn.  When a card is played by a player, the player attempts to use the information on the card to address the problem.  The player then draws a new card.  Play continues until the cards run out or the problem is addressed to the satisfaction of the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the card set and games is to innovate novel solutions to known issues, or to generate inventive ideas, which might be patentable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
