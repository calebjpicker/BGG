						               													<description>CocoLocoColor its a party game where players have six different ways to play with its colorful deck:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Fortune Teller: The goal is to be the first to run out of cards. The players must place the cards face down and in order they will have to throw a card while saying aloud one of the colors of the palette of the match. If you hit the color, you collect all the cards up to that point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Snake: The goal is to be the first to run out of cards. Players will have to place a card that says the color of the previous card. If a player cannot place any card from his hand, he must pass his turn. Each player can place as many cards as he can on his turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Trident: The goal is to get as many trios as possible. Players can put the cards together if they all have the same color or the same word is written on them. The players must always have 6 cards in their turn, so they will have to take as many cards from the central deck as they have used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Duel: The goal is to be the first to run out of cards. Six cards are dealt to each player and the rest are placed, face down, forming a deck on the table. Players will take cards from the central deck at the same time and place them face up on the table. Then, they can put their hand on top of one of them if they can match it with a card from their hand. Every time a player gets a pair, he will discard those cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Pairs: The goal is to get as many pairs as possible. 6 cards are dealt to each player and 9 will be placed face down, forming a grid on the table. The rest of the cards are placed face down in a deck. Each player will pick up 3 cards in turn to memorize their content and quickly turn them over again. He will then search his hand for a card whose text matches one of the cards he had picked up. Only if a match is made will he continue to play. Each player can make up to 5 matches on their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Stairs: The goal is to be the first to run out of cards. 6 cards are dealt to each player and the rest are placed face down in a central deck. The person who has one of the double cards will start playing, since each stair is formed starting from them. Each player will put a card in their turn and they will be completed according to the order of the colors of CocoLocoColor. In case of not being able to use any of the ones in his hand, he will take one from the central deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
