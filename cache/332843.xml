						               													<description>Twin Realms is a complex dungeon crawler.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will be controlling elemental spirits that protect the world from an army of demons. Each quest is unique and many of them have specific objectives. They are not only limited to &amp;quot;kill all that moves&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;The combat is played in turns on a board (different for every quest) divided into squares and players will be able to perform actions using a deck of ability cards unique to each elemental spirit.&amp;#10;The distinct feature of the game is hinted in its name. You will be playing in two realms. Physical, and spiritual. The playable characters as well as enemies have 2 forms with different abilities in each realm. The movement will be different in each realm. And some board elements will be different between realms (imagine walls that you can pass through as a spirit but not in physical form). The combat and gameplay will be guided by the fact that you will have to switch between realms to optimize your combat abilities, to avoid enemy attacks etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All characters will be developed by levelling up from 1 to 10. Apart from regular upgrades to health and your ability cards you will be able to choose additional perks and choose your path in the game. You can focus on passive abilities, special system of attack modifiers, additional boosts to your cards or special rage cards. You will not be able to maximise all of the perks so every player will be able to build their character in their own way. You can build a character with a very strong set of cards less reliable on attack modifiers. You can build a character that has no upgrades on the cards but most of the attack modifiers are critical hits, burn targets, disarm them or add other status effects. You can build a character that does not focus on any of that but instead generates a ton of rage and exploits various bonuses of the rage deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each character will be able to fulfil a specific role in the company based on its abilities and its build. The roles are the usual set of tanks, assassins, mages and supports. However, that only applies to the physical realm.&amp;#10;While in physical realm each character will try to fulfil their assigned role, in spirit realm all characters are the same, which means that in spirit realm you will share the responsibilities of dealing and taking damage. When you kill enemy spirits, you will be gathering their essence and taking over their actions to create interesting combat situations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place in a unique world not long after its creation. There are no humans, dwarves, elves or any other races yet in it. The elementals and the demons are being led by primordial forces of good and evil. As you progress through the game you will learn more about the mythology of this world and what role you play in the history of things.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
