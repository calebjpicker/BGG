						               													<description>The year is 1845 and the Far East is a new land of possibilities.  Foreign businessmen called Taipan, have settled here to capitalize on the growing trade routes through the oceans of the Far East.  From the southern tip of Nippon down to Makassar, the Taipan are making large profits.  But with any lucrative endeavor, criminals, smugglers, and pirates seek to take advantage of weaker prey, making these waters very dangerous.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You have just arrived in Hong Kong and taken out a loan to get your new Trading Company started.  You have a ship and a crew.  All that is left is to command your ship through the trade routes of the Far East and be the first to pay off your debt to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the Game:&amp;#10;At the start of the game, each player chooses a special Captain Card with a special ability, they also receive a small amount of starting funds, and their Debt that must be paid off to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns moving their ship throughout the Eastern Seas trading goods between different ports, Hong Kong, Singapore, Makassar, Nagasaki, and more.  At the start of the game, players will only have a small amount of funds with witch to buy cargo.  Balancing they're purchasing of cargo, choosing the best place to sell the cargo, upgrading your ship, and using their Captain's special ability will give the players the best chance to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to making the best choices, players will have many events that can change each players strategy.  Cities may have events that alter the value of goods at that port.  A fire in a city may make wood very valuable there for a short period of time.  A gold mine may create an over abundance that dives the price down making that city a prime place to get gold at a good price.  Also, Pirate Tokens placed on the game board hold a great risk of loss of cargo, a damaged ship, and upgrades that will have to be repaired before they can be used again.  But winning a battle against pirates can also grant the rewards or plundered cargo.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Who will be the first Merchant to successfully navigate these dangerous waters, pay off his debt, and win the game?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
