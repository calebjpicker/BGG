						               													<description>Knight More was released in Japan at the 2014 Tokyo Game Market and is a trick-taking game for 3 to 5 players. The deck features 4 suits (Knights, Archers, Spearmen, Swordsman) ranked 1 to 10. The deck also includes 2 unsuited Ambush cards. The goal of the game is to avoid getting eliminated from play and to take the final trick of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place over 6 rounds. At the start of each round players are dealt a hand of cards, receiving one less during the deal in each subsequent round (6 in round one, 5 in round two, etc). A random trump suit is revealed from the top of the undealt card deck. Players will try to take tricks using standard &amp;quot;must follow&amp;quot; rules. The winner of a trick is determined by assessing who played the highest value in the lead suit or the highest valued trump. When following suit, the unsuited Ambush cards may be played at any time whether suit can be followed or trumped. Ambush cards rank higher than any suited card, including trump. However, when resolving a trick that includes an Ambush, if a 1 rank card in any suit is present the Ambush is ineligible to win the trick. If both Ambush cards are played to the same trick, the second played wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each round, any players who have taken zero tricks are eliminated from the game. The player who wins the most tricks in a round will be the lead player of the next. The game continues until one of the following occurs:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) A player wins the game by collecting all tricks in a round, leaving all other players with zero tricks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) A player wins the game by making it to round 6 and winning the final trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is an optional variant called &amp;quot;Guerrilla Operations&amp;quot;. The game is played the same, except the first time a player takes zero tricks in a round they are not eliminated. Instead, in the following round they are dealt a single card. During that round, on their turn they may play this card into any trick of their choosing. If they don't want to play it into a trick they may pass. If a player can use this card to win a trick they will re-enter the game in the following round. A player is only eligible to receive the single card second chance if it's the first time they end a round with zero tricks. If a player collects zero tricks for a second time after having re-entered the game previously or fails to win a trick with their single second chance card, they are eliminated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
