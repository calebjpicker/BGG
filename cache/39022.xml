						               													<description>From Publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Figure rules for gaming with Dinosaurs, other Prehistoric Creatures and Humans foolish enough to get involved with them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of the game is to keep your Dinosaurs alive and eat the other players Dinosaurs, causing them as much trouble as you can.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each species has it's own characteristics, 6 or more (more if it flies or swims), plus a size bracket (which affects combat, but another characteristic, Concealment, affects spotting) and a points cost. Each turn, in initiative order (roll 1d10) creatures move (a distance determined by species), attack one another (opposed d10 rolls adding attack &amp;amp; defence per species), suffer the consequences (damage reduces characteristics), attempt to spot other creatures (sensory acuity by species) and test for panic if attacked or hurt (panic rating, again, by species, less aggressive species panic more easily. Rules on ambushes, charges and some very simple terrain effects are included, as are rules for time-travelling human intervention - either 'cave men' or modern hunters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;51 species of ancient creatures are detailed (all of which are available in 10mm scale metal miniatures from the publisher), along with variously armed humans and their vehicles (with ranged combat rules). A number of possible scenario suggestions is included. The rules are simple by figures gaming standards, but fairly complete as a combat game. Graphics are very basic, and the rulebook is 24 pages of A4 stapled with a clear plastic cover.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;UPDATE: as of the end of 2020, the latest version, while seeming to have the same rules, presentation, and physical format, has a MASSIVELY expanded list of creatures, close to 600 of them! These now cover everything from the Cambrian (admittedly with only one entry!) to the Tertiary. Accordingly, page count has increased to 44.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
