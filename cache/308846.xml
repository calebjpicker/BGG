						               													<description>Jackpot! Break the Bank is a slot machine deck builder for 1-4 players where players are trying to earn money and victory points, and use their earnings to optimize their decks and attempt to hit the legendary Jackpot! - Breaking the bank!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played simultaneously. Each round players get to draw two cards to their hand, and then 'pull the lever' and draw the top three cards in your slot machine deck into your three slots. Players now get to play a card from their hand into the slot machine to change the outcome.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to hit payouts. Payouts occur when a player has three symbols of the same kind: ie. ???. When hitting a payout, the player is awarded a &amp;#226;&amp;#173;&amp;#144;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will be optimizing their decks by sending cards to their opponents as well as purchasing cards that will yield bigger winnings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The end game condition is triggered when any player &amp;quot;breaks the bank&amp;quot; which is a term used by the casinos when a player is winning more money than is currently available.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One cool feature in this game is that you never shuffle your deck. Once your slot machine deck is depleted - you simply stack your three slots into a new deck. This means that when playing cards from your hand, you will organize your deck and increase your chances of hitting payouts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will also have 4 personal objectives that can be completed in a specific order. These are for instance to hit a payout using cherries. The next objective could be to win with melons. The final objective is always to hit the Jackpot ?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When there is no more money in the bank. The game ends - and the players count all &amp;#226;&amp;#173;&amp;#144; they have on their cards. &amp;#226;&amp;#173;&amp;#144; they got from completing their objectives, as well as any &amp;#226;&amp;#173;&amp;#144;-tokens they got for hitting a payout.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who has the most &amp;#226;&amp;#173;&amp;#144; wins Jackpot! Break the bank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
