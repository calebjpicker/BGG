						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;Royal Defense&amp;rdquo; is an easy fantasy-themed strategy game. You are supposed to assume the role of the militant feudal and to put a halt to the hostile lords&amp;rsquo; encroachments on the throne of the fairy kingdom. Mercenaries will help you: they are ready to spill their blood on the battlefield for a pretty penny and promises of glory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Royal Defense&amp;rdquo; vaguely resembles &amp;ldquo;Battles of magicians&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Memoir&amp;rsquo;44&amp;rdquo;. Lords&amp;rsquo; castles are located on both sides of the game-board. Players can recruit troops and build fortifications there. The battlefield itself is two-sided and it contains special structures, giving bonuses to players who occupy these locations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before starting the game, each player chooses one of the four mercenary factions, which will be his army. Characters of each faction are represented by the cards. They have their own  particularities, strengths and weaknesses. A lot of soldiers have not only ordinary characteristics such as velocity, attack and defence, but also some special abilities (which are very often unique for the army) that can be used during the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The confrontation between barons is very swift. Having recruited troops from hand, a player can move forward and attack. As soldiers can move only forward, so five &amp;ldquo;corridors&amp;rdquo; appear on the battlefield where the major battles occur. But each player can activate only five units during his or her turn, and some characters can change the lines they move along. All these points transform simple mechanics into an interesting tactical puzzle. The more the player is experienced, the more difficult is to solve this puzzle. Moreover, spells, able to change course of action, are available for each player. Soldiers also can be sent to the Catacombs in the hope of finding treasures hidden there.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two ways to win: to help your mercenaries to end up beyond the edge of your adversary&amp;rsquo;s field or to get 20 points for having struck adversary&amp;rsquo;s troops and having destroyed his structures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Royal Defense&amp;rdquo; is a duel strategy game with low learning curve. Its rules are easy to explain and the game will not take long. Besides, rules also propose different options for three and four players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
