						               													<description>Berd is a new abstract strategy game for two players. The goal of the game is to collect more tokens than your opponent. Players collect token(s) when crossing the board starting from their base line and finishing - passing opponent&amp;rsquo;s baseline. On their path to finish players can capture opponent&amp;rsquo;s token(s)&amp;#10;Some definitions: &amp;#10;1. Tower &amp;ndash; is a stack of two or more tokens; &amp;#10;2. Berd is a tower with two or more same color tokens on the top; &amp;#10;3.Unprotected tower or unprotected token (UT) &amp;ndash; a single token or a tower that is not Berd. Unprotected tower moves like a single token. &amp;#10;4. Recovering a captured token &amp;ndash; player can recover the captured token by landing on UT and by restacking the tower create a Berd.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the game players arrange their tokens on their baseline (the first row from player&amp;rsquo;s side) in any combination. Players move their UT (unprotected token or Unprotected tower) one square at a time forward or side. You can&amp;rsquo;t move your UT diagonally or backward. While you can move your UT laterally however you can&amp;rsquo;t do more than three consecutive side moves. Players can capture opponent&amp;rsquo;s token by landing on a square occupied by a single token or unprotected tower. You can&amp;rsquo;t capture or land on a square occupied by your opponent&amp;rsquo;s Berd. A player can recover his/her captured token from opponent&amp;rsquo;s unprotected tower by landing on that tower. In this case the player will restack tokens and place his/her tokens on the top creating a Berd. In order to play a token from the Berd you have to split the Berd and play a single token or unprotected tower. If there are captured opponent&amp;rsquo;s tokens in the Berd they must be attached at least under one of your token; -so basically you move UT from your Berd. The game is over when only one player has active token(s) left on the board.  Now players can stack their collected tokens and see whose tower is taller or who collected more tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Variations of the game:&amp;#10;1. Berd strategy game can be played on different size boards (3x3; 4x4; 5x5; 6x6) and/or with various number of tokens. Two sided board supplied in this game with 3x3 and 4x4 sides. Recommended to play with 5 tokens per each player on 3x3 and max 6 tokens on 4x4 board. &amp;#10;2. Game with color protection &amp;ndash; Players can use colored squares on the board for protection from being captured by the opponent&amp;rsquo;s token. For example: Red color player&amp;rsquo;s UT (single token or unprotected tower) will be protected on the Red square. Other rules are identical to the basic Berd game.&amp;#10;3. Game with points &amp;ndash; in this game each token assigned different weight/points (10; 20; 30; 40; 50 ..), shown on the token. This option of the game provides more possibilities for moves. The winner will be a player who collects higher total score. In order to play this version of the game you need to attach stickers with numbers. There are lines on the sides of the token for even attachment.&amp;#10;4. Game with hidden points &amp;ndash; games #1; 2 and 3 can be played with tokens that have hidden numbers (numbers are not displayed outside, they are attached inside). This game is similar to game #3 with the difference that only a player who possesses a token can see the weight of that token. This feature introduces more intrigue and uncertainty about the end result of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
