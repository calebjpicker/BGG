Players fill their holds with different types of goods - copper, glass, coal and linen - as they sail from port to port buying and selling goods, amassing their fortunes. The game is played over 4 rounds whose length is determined by a series of events both players are subject to. Different values for buying and selling are set by a Trade Market that changes prices from round to round. Competing for victory points, players may also purchase upgrades to their ships. This game is also suitable for solitaire play and takes 20-30 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All three games are designed  to be quickly learned, easy to play and fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
