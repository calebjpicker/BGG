						               													<description>Sorrow of Salilth is a microgame for one or two players lasting about 20 minutes. When playing a 2 player game, one player assumes the role of the Council of Wardens, trying to defend the city of Salilth from the servants of the Grayking and close four barrier gates within the city. If the four gates are closed or all of the Servant units are defeated, Salilth is saved and the Warden Player wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The other player controls the forces of the Grayking trying to overwhelm Salilth and reach the Citadel of the Wardens where they attempt to place 10 Siege Corruption tokens within the Citadel, If they are successful, or can defeat all of the Warden Units, Salilth is lost and the Grayking Player wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When playing the solitaire variant, the player assumes the Council of Wardens role.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Needed: one 2-page hex map, 1 rule sheet, 1 unit counter sheet and 1 sheet of nomograph tables.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup: The Warden Player places all of their units inside the Citadel, stacked by type.&amp;#10;The player should also take the 4 Barrier Gate tokens, placing them within reach. They then place the marker on the Sparkblades icon on the Spell Rondel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Grayking Player divides their units into 6 stacks each with 6 unit counters. These stacks may be configured as desired by the player. They then place one stack on each of the 6 numbered zones outside the city. The player should also take the 10 Siege Corruption Tokens, placing them within reach.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play: Each round of the game has 4 phases: Movement, Combat, Damage, Siege. Then a new round begins. The Grayking Player always goes first each phase, followed by the Warden Player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Win: If all 4 gates are closed or all of Servant units are defeated, Salilth is saved and the Warden Player wins. If 10 Siege Corruption tokens are placed in the Citadel or all Warden Units are defeated, the Grayking Player wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Variant: At game start, randomly sort the Grayking units into the 6 stacks of 6 units each, and place each stack randomly on each of the 6 numbered starting zones. During the Movement Phase, the player will move the Grayking units based on the rules as outlined above. Movement will always occur towards the Citadel and units will always form a larger group if there is a path choice. When splitting 4 or more units, always move units in order of the largest Spirit Strength first. During the Siege Phase, one Siege Corruption Token is added each round as long as any Servant unit occupies the Citadel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game uses nomographs instead of look-up tables and was designed to use a minimum number of components.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sorrow of Salilth is a prequel to the Print and Play game - Shadows Upon Lassadar. A further game - Revenge of the Raven Consort - will complete the game trilogy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winner of the 2011 BGG Microgame contest&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
