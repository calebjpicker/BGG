						               													<description>As the CEO of a new asteroid mining space start-up, your job is to make the most money from exploring nearby asteroids for precious resources. Coordinate your ships and their crew to claim and extract everything they can from these asteroids and return them to Earth for the biggest profit. The more you control the supply of one type of resource the more money you can make. But watch out for other competitors who want to expand their asteroid mining empires too!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Asteroid Empire is a 9 card game that puts rival CEO's of asteroid mining start-ups against each other to make the most profit. Can you make the most money and expand your space mining empire?&amp;#10;The aim is to be the mining start-up with the most money once all of the nearby asteroids have been mined and the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played over a number of rounds in which players can explore or mine each asteroid. The player with the start token goes first, once they have placed a ship their opponent gets to place a ship and play continues to alternate until both players have placed all their ships (to either explore or extract) and the round ends. Once a ship has been placed in a round it cannot be moved or returned to the players hand. At the end of each round both players will retrieve all their ships and the start token is passed to the other player who will then go first in the next round. The remaining asteroids are not shuffled and left in the same order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the last asteroid is claimed to be mined then the game ends and the materials extracted can be counted to determine who generated the most income. The income each resource is worth depends on how many cards of that resource each player has and is listed on each asteroid card with that resource type.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
