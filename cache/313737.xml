						               													<description>Water is scarce and becoming scarcer every day! You and your team of experts has been called upon to solve one crisis after another across the globe. The countdown is on in Diamonds for Water, a new cooperative deck building game from Big Girl Games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In each game, a team is made up of water experts who must work together to achieve a final solution to a region-specific water problem. Players begin with a deck of basic cards which are supplemented by purchasing cards from the Market. On each turn, the players must engage with a Conflict, and resolve whatever problems the water issue brings up. Then they gather the resources from the cards in their hand and take any of several actions: help their teammates, purchase new cards for their deck, invest diamonds in the Bank, or trade and spend currency to solve the ongoing Goal or Objective.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players choose from characters with special Actions. They may be able to help their fellow players stay healthy, draw extra cards, or receive extra Food or Energy. Each character also has a Skill they can choose to use three times in a game, such as halting the countdown marker or digging through the Market draw deck to find elusive Water cards. While Food and Energy are plentiful, trading for Diamonds requires them to be available in the Bank, and getting them there can require some sacrifice for the team. However, team members can also Plant and Harvest left over Food as a way to raise the currency they need for more expensive items, such as Water cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the world of the game, Water is actually more valuable than Diamonds. And it becomes more scarce as you play - a Countdown Marker shows how water is running out while your team tries to solve each problem. Let the Countdown Marker reach 0 without resolving each Goal and Objective, and your team loses. Fix the problems using Energy, Diamonds, and Water, and you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
