						               													<description>Each round one of the players is the bachelor and the others try to woo them by selecting two good attributes from their hand, while also giving one of their opponents a bad attribute to sabotage them. When introducing themselves to the bachelor, the players also draw a &amp;quot;traitor&amp;quot; card, which tells who revealed their red flag to the bachelor.&amp;#10;After the bachelor has decided who they'd prefer to date a new round begins, with the next bachelor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cards provide funny combinations, sometimes with dark humor and shock value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
