						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;Rome don't pay traitors&amp;rdquo;  (puts them to rule)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pro Roma! is  a strategy and management game in which players put themselves in the shoes of Rome senators with the goal to obtain power through their management to lead their faction to the hegemony .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To do this, first  they must fight in the Senate to obtain Charges and be able to take control of the different areas of the city management: They must be efficient enough to be recognized by the people, making the City prosper and defending it from incursions. and dangers from its borders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are three phases: Election, Management and Event.&amp;#10;In the first phase players take resource cards and they must decide which card must be used to obtain votes, votes that later will be decisive to obtain Charges through a hidden betting mechanism, Charges like the Consul, the Edil or the Tribune. The game compensates those who obtain less relevant Charges giving them more possibilities to opt to better Charges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second phase players will be able to perform the actions assigned to their Charges in a established order. For which they will have the resource cards that remain in their hand. The goal is to put their counters every time he can do a successfully action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the last phase maybe Rome must face a raid, for which the military investment that the players have made so far can be decisive for the victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game will ends when a player uses all its counters, being declared the winner. On the other hand, an automatic victory is also possible if a player must use a counter when he doesn't have  any counter in his reserve.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
