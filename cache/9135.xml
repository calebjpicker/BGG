						               													<description>This is an update of the World War II: European Theater of Operations game published by TSR/SPI. It is a corps-level simulation of the battle in Europe during World War II.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Advanced ETO is much more than just another World War II strategy game; Advanced ETO is an accurate simulation of the war in Europe, with historically accurate forces and combat units! All of the game's combat units have been exhaustively researched for technical accuracy (derived from the actual military TO&amp;amp;Es of World War II). The naval and air units have been meticulously recreated as well, reflecting the authentic performance and abilities of these implements of war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Better yet, Advanced ETO's production model is an exact duplication of the actual production figures from the Second World War, providing players with a genuine simulation of the industrial aspect of World War II in Europe. As such, Advanced ETO contains almost twice as many pieces as the original ETO (over 2200!), including new mechanized, mountain, commando and cavalry units, additional naval and aircraft types, more Generals and even Admirals. For you naval buffs; Advanced ETO now contains absolutely every capital ship that existed during World War II, including additional aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and raiders. Advanced ETO even includes numerous naval vessels that were planned but never completed-allowing the players some very interesting &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; possibilities. If air power is your forte, Advanced ETO includes just about every type of combat air unit that saw action in Europe during World War II. This includes many of the rare types, such as the P-61 &amp;quot;Black Widow,&amp;quot; the Fw 200 &amp;quot;Condor,&amp;quot; Yak-9, Bloch 174, &amp;quot;Defiant&amp;quot; and many, many more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And that's not all!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Advanced ETO has two new beautiful 23 x 34 inch maps that encompass all of Europe and North Africa-everything from the icy Arctic Ocean to the deserts of the Middle East, including over 38 nations and  territories, newly researched topography, additional cities and ports (such as Dresden, Leeds, Gorki, and even the Azores, just to name a few). Newly added technically accurate rail road lines, updated resource areas, plus additional rivers and lakes. Virtually every aspect of World War II in Europe is here. Best of all, Advanced ETO can be played as an exciting grand strategic game (from the beginning of the war to the end), or as one of the many quick campaigns or scenarios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
