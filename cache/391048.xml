						               													<description>Time Division contains cards for 3 eras: Ancient Egypt, Dark Ages, 80s. You can play a single era or a campaign of 3 eras.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players try to win control over an era by gathering the most influential characters. They achieve this through the way they draft and play the character cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game consists of two major phases: Draft and Play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Draft is done simultaneously by both players. Each player distributes 3 cards between themself, their rival and the Independent Stack  until all 18 Era Characters are distributed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play consists of 6 rounds. In each round the players play one card each. Then the player with the card of higher influence decides over the 2 played cards: Which card should be triggered by their player for its effect and which is moved to the Influence Area of their player? A coin indicates who is deciding, but also who has to play first in the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each era and each character have unique effects and therefore require a different tactical approach and deliver.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
