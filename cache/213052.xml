						               													<description>PM Galaxy is a board game that has been developed as a tool to facilitate the learning of project management concepts in a fun and engaging way. It is intended for project management trainers and consultants, project managers, project team leaders and team members. Basically, for all those involved in projects who want to improve their project management knowledge while having a great time together with their team! The Game is available (for now) in English and Romanian languages.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a collaborative and competitive board game for 3 to 5 players, where each player, alias &amp;bdquo;project manager&amp;rdquo;, takes control of a distinctive project. Although each project manager fights to be the first one to complete his or her project, these projects are interdependent and share, as it always happens, limited resources. The task of each project manager is to guide their projects through its phases, gathering resources by answering quizzes and investing those resources to overcome challenges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We built PM Galaxy to cover both the fun part (the secret ingredient to building a team) and the educational part as well. It can be anything you want &amp;ndash; a board game to play with your team, a learning tool, a training instrument, you name it. PM Galaxy is meant to help players learn and remember key concepts of project management and best practices in the field, by testing their knowledge and rewarding them for their efforts in a fun and engaging way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We also have been using the game in our project management training sessions with great success. The participants love it and it adds a nice twist to the classic project management training. The game can be used throughout the whole training with debrief sessions or at the end as a Recap tool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game, which was developed based on the Project Management Institute standards, is to gather all necessary project documents and resources for your project, while also helping the project you depend on, in order to win. Or you could just look after yourself and hope for the best or sabotage the other players, but we strongly advise against it. From our experience so far this approach didn&amp;rsquo;t prove fruitful, neither in the PM Galaxy nor in real life :)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
