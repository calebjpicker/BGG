						               													<description>Fifth installment in Rick Young&amp;rsquo;s Fast Action Battle Series. &amp;#10;FAB turns East.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The time is set for Operation Barbarossa and the greatest tank battle of all times: more than 3.000 Soviet and nearly 700 German tanks and assault guns will clash in Soviet occupied Southern Poland. Known as the Battle of Brody-Dubno-Lutsk, that bloody triangle saw the direst straits of invading German forces in Barbarossa as they struggle for a week to repel the massive Soviet armored counterattacks to the flanks of the spearhead formed by Ewald Kleist's 1st Panzergruppe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;German invasion force was aimed towards Kiev and the Kiev Special Military District was the better armed and prepared of all Soviet Fronts stationed on the Westerns borders of the URSS, with a full array of Soviet Mechanized Corps, equipped with hundreds of the new brand tanks KV and T-34.&amp;#10;As the German player you control two powerful German armies: 6th and 1st Panzergruppe. The Soviet player will control the Northern flank of the Southwestern Front &amp;ndash;formed by the 5th and 6th all arms armies. Blocks are mostly divisions with some regiments/brigades and German Kampfgruppen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In DUBNO&amp;rsquo;41 you will see, with a minimum of new rules, the Soviet unpreparedness for war in June 1941 as they desperately struggled for defeating the German invaders. Soviets had a huge amount of low quality units with powerful but fragile armored forces against the Wehrmacht at its peak of quality and efficiency. Not a one-sided battle as someone could think about Operation Barbarossa but the Soviets could accomplish their mission and defeat or at least stop the invaders. The game includes assets for minor but powerful German units as the elite 652nd Panzerjaeger battalion or the scarce panzer grenadiers units fully equipped with armored carrier vehicles, heavy artillery, anti-tank units, the all-known 88&amp;rsquo;s cannons and more. Events include Soviet extra-hard KV and T-34 tanks, flamethrower tanks, air attacks, Soviet mechanical breakdowns and political officers and more&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;German swiftness and tactical ability is opposed to Soviet mass and technological advantage. Weirdly not a single Stuka plane would arrive to help the German forces as Army Group South was not equipped with that type of aircraft. Soviet Air Force will fight one of its more desperate battles adding considerable strength to Soviet ground attacks. Will you pierce the Soviet lines and breakout towards Kiev, or you would slow the German advance and counterattack successfully defeating the invaders?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
