						               													<description>Kharberg is a simplified form of the moorish game Damma, but with a difference. &amp;#10;The gamepieces may be moved in any given direction, so the player has the choice of eight directions for each pawn. This gives Kharberg game an edge (far more mobility) over the games where the pieces only may be moved forward.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To play KHARBERG the players need: &amp;#10;12 white pawns &amp;#10;12 black pawns &amp;#10;1 board consisting of 25 squares (5 x 5) &amp;#10; On each square a pawn is placed. The middle square of the board is unoccupied at the start of the game. The gamepieces are placed on the board in the following order:&amp;#10;In front of the player the pawns of his color are placed on the first two rows. The two remaining pawns are placed on the two  squares to the right of the centrepoint.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 'black' player has the first move. Object of the game is to capture all the pawns of the opponent. Pieces are caught by jumping over the square they occupy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Purpose of the game:&amp;#10;The purpose of Kharberg is to catch all the pieces of the opponent or to block them so that they can&amp;rsquo;t be moved any longer. Whoever succeeds wins the game. Draws can also occur (if both players have an equal number of game pieces on the board without the possibility of a decision).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turn and stroke options:&amp;#10;Each piece can move a field in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction (forward and backward). Capturing pieces is done by jumping over them.&amp;#10;If the opponent refuses a stroke or overlooks the pawn that had to be caught, his pawn must be removed from the board (the so-called blow). The playing piece must be taken off before the player moves his own piece. If a move has already been made, the option of removal expires.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the black pawns starts the game.&amp;#10;In the next game, the winner gets the black pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
