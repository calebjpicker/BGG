						               													<description>Roundtable Games consists of four different 2 - 4 player games that are designed to be played on a common game board, called the Roundtable. The four games are Roundtable Chess, Roundtable Checkers, Wordstack, and Checkers Roulette. The game includes 4 complete sets of chess men, 4 complete sets of checkers (15  per set), and four sets of letter tiles (45 per set) that are used for playing Wordstack and Checkers Roulette.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Roundtable Chess is extreme and exciting chess play for 2 or 4 players. Each player plays with a complete set of 16 chessmen. Chessmen move and make captures as done in the traditional two player chess game. Chessmen in Roundtable chess can also be move in circular directions. Each player&amp;rsquo;s objective is to gain control of the center of the Roundtable by safely moving his/her king into that position without it being checked or captured. The first king to control the center of the Roundtable wins.&amp;#10;     Roundtable Checkers gives traditional checkers and extreme twist of excitement and face lift. It's designed for 2 or 4 players. Each starts with 15 checkers and can choose thousands of ways to set them up.  Players can also move up to four different checkers per turn in a circular, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical direction. Like regular checkers, you make single or multiple jumps to capture the opponents' playing pieces. The player that captures the greatest number of enemy checkers wins.  &amp;#10;     Wordstack is an exciting 3-dimensional word game that plays 2 or 4 players. Each player selects 15 lettered checkers from her set of 45 tiles ranging from A to Z. Players may move up to 10 different lettered checkers per turn in diagonal, vertical, horizontal, or circular patterns. The player's objective is to earn points by combining (joining) her checker(s) with an opponent's checker(s) in order to spell words. Words may be spelled forward or backward, and in a diagonal, vertical, horizontal, or circular direction. Players may also capture (jump) an opponent's checker(s) to form a stack of checkers. The stack of captured checkers becomes a &amp;quot;Wordstack&amp;quot; when it is combined (joined) with an opponent's piece(s) to form words. The player who earns the highest number of points wins.&amp;#10;     Checkers Roulette is numbers fun for 2 or 4 players. Each player uses 15 numbered checkers that include the values 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Players may move up to 4 different checkers per turn in a circular, diagonal, horizontal, or vertical direction. You score points by capturing (jumping) an opponent's checker(s), and lose points when your checkers are captured. For example, if your checker with the value of &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; captures an opponent&amp;rsquo;s checker with the value &amp;quot;10&amp;quot;, you earn 50 points (5 &amp;times; 10 = 50), and the opponent loses 50 points. You also earn or lose points by setting up plays. The player that earns the greatest number of points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
