						               													<description>This is a Demo Deck produced by TableStar Games, LLC.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a playable Dueling Deck that offering a sampling from each of the major HeroCard titles. Easy to understand Dueling rules are included on the backside of 3 the Attribute Cards and on both sides of the Reference card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Demo Deck contains the following 3 unique cards and 27 reprints from other sets:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Unique Body Attribute Card (strength 8)with instructions on reverse&amp;#10;     Unique Mind Attribute Card (strength 8) with instructions on reverse&amp;#10;     Unique Attribute X card (strength 4) with instructions on reverse&amp;#10;     Standard double-sided reference card&amp;#10;     26 Action Cards reprinted from 24 different decks, games and expansions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Herocard Duel is the main conflict resolution mechanic of any Herocard game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players have 3 cards in place as reference, Body, Mind and Attribute X. Each card lists the amount of that attribute that is allowed to be played during a given turn. Each character within the various Herocard games contains a unique combination of attributes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The attacking player lays a basic attack up to the ammount allowed by the corresponding attribute (most basic attacks use points in Body). The defending player may then play a basic defense card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The attacking player may continue taking turns adding modifiers to that attack which the defending player may opt to modify his block to defend against.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the total amount of the attack is greater than the total amount of the block, then the attack goes through. If the block is greater it is not successful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The attacker's turn is now over and he may not recover any spent points until the beginning of his next turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The following turn begins with the next player clearing no more than 3 cards (always chosen from the top of the played stacks) and regaining those attribute points to spend. If the defender played more than 3 cards, he will have to leave one of the cards  uncleared and will not regain the full points in whatever attribute the card was left in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In a Herocard game such as Orcwars or Rise of the Shogun, a player may move his pieces on the board which dictate who is eligible to be attacked. The purpose of the demo deck however is to familiarize the player with the deck dueling mechanics and has no board game associated with it. Player two is free to attack the other player or save points to counter the next attack. Either way, the duel is over at the first strike.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Action cards from the demo deck can be used in conjunction with any other action cards to create customized decks to expand any of the HeroCard titles. Each of the four characters from Tablestar's current Herocard games comes with a unique set of action cards thematically oriented to that game. The demo deck makes customized characters easy without disrupting currently existing decks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
