						               													<description>Solo time musical game which is designed based on AGF initiatively to instill a life long passion and understanding of music and its concepts through a fun hands on experience. &amp;#10;Game story&amp;#10;The territory of Parug expanded with technology and high-rise buildings. Next to the territory of Parug, there was the land of Mintras, which, unlike Parug, was far from technology.&amp;#10;The people of Mintras were creatures and human beings who worked in every field of thought. The mayor of Parug built strong gates throughout the territory to keep the distance between the people of Parug and the creatures and humans of Mintras.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sequential Action method:&amp;#10;A game round consists of a Repeating Action and a Sequential Action. This means that at the beginning of each round you have to select a Repeating Action and after performing it, select a Sequential Action and do it so the round ends.&amp;#10;After you have selected a Sequential Action from a set in the first round of the game, you must use the following sets in the next round, you are not allowed to return to the previous sets. When you reach set 5, you must return to set 1. This process is repeated until the end of the 24 minute soundtrack.&amp;#10;So in each round, you have a Repeating Action that is constant and you can use one of them in each round. After using duplicate operations, select one at the beginning of the game from set 1 of sequential operations. In the next round, when it comes to selecting Sequential Action, you have to choose from set 2 and so on.&amp;#10;End of the Game&amp;#10;There are 3 Endings in the game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     IF the 24 minute soundtrack is finished. &amp;#10;     If you cannot detain a creature in 4 rounds.&amp;#10;     If Villains or creatures decks runs out. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring&amp;#10;After the 24 minute and the end of the game, you count your points. Every resolved case worth 1 point and every detained creature are 5 points. Count your whole points and record it on the Detective Sheet every time you play the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
