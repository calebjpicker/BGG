						               													<description>EOKA is a simulation game for two players of the 1955-59 conflict between the terrorist group EOKA (Ethnik&amp;iacute; Org&amp;aacute;nosis Kipriako&amp;uacute; Ag&amp;oacute;nos, or National Organisation of Cypriot Struggle) and the security forces of the United Kingdom and the Government of Cyprus.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;EOKA is meant to be played by two players. One, the EOKA player, plays the role of General George Grivas, the military leader of EOKA. The other player, the Empire player, plays the role of the Governor of Cyprus (which at the time was a British colony). A third faction, representing Turkish Cypriot non-state militia and British expatriates who acted as vigilantes, is not played by a human player but will perform in accordance with a set of &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The currency of victory in this game is a player's Political Support Level (PSL), which is measured in Political Support Points (PSP) and changes constantly during the game. If either player's PSL reaches 0 at any point in the game, the game will end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the Empire PSL reaches zero, it means something along the lines of a negotiated settlement has been reached among the British, Greek and Turkish governments on the future status of Cyprus. Historically, one was reached at the beginning of 1959 which decided that Cyprus would be an independent country, without ethnic partitions, and that the British would be allowed to maintain several military bases on the island.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the EOKA PSL reaches zero, it means something like a collapse of the viability of the organization has occurred -  the Greek government decides it should no longer be supported, the population of Cyprus turns against what EOKA proposes, the security forces manage to round up or eliminate much of EOKA's field units, etc..&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is the latest addition to a family of broadly similar games by Brian Train, including Tupamaro, Shining Path, Algeria, Andartes and Kandahar. New concepts added in this game include Civic Levels, the lasting effects of violent kinetic operations, and some simple solitaire rules (if a lone player wants to oppose an automated Empire).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
