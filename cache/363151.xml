						               													<description>After years of quasi-peace since 2016, the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist armies that Russia supported and built-up launched another attack with the aim of seizing more territory. It was hoped to occupy the city of Kharkov and Dnipro but even more modest gains would have political and military value, in addi-tion, further destabilize the Ukrainian government.&amp;#10;Both sides had similar military strength with 35,000 front line troops manning the fortified front lines. The DPA and LNR, 914 AFVs, 720 artillery guns, 202 rocket artillery between the two pro-Russian forces. Each had around 200 tanks. Among these were at least 2100 Russian forces to assist. However, Putin also had placed elements from the 3rd Motorized Division along the northern border from its 20th Army and the 150th Division not far near the Crimea. The 150th was quite strong with two tank regiments and two mechanized infantry regiments. Either or both, if used, would be a decisive in seizing more Ukrainian territory.&amp;#10;The Ukrainian forces were capable and equal in most aspects, especially their elite units that proved their worth in 2014 and 2015. The front lines were vintage WW1 with trench lines and fortified areas along the main avenues of approach. Many of the Ukrainian units were mainly reinforced battalion strength de-spite their regimental or brigade designation. In fact, many &amp;quot;bri-gades&amp;quot; only had one or two battalions.&amp;#10;While they had many more AFVs, many needed refitting or repaired as with much of their equipment. The one new weapon was the American Javelin AT. Ukraine had 47 launchers and 360 missiles which could be used against armor and structures. They also had 12 Turkish Bayraktar UAV for reconnaissance.&amp;#10;As in previous battles, both fought with tenacity and the tipping point was always whether the Russians would send in their units, which they did in 2014, 2015. The other potential was whether the Americans also send in help from Poland.&amp;#10;With both sides facing each other since 2016 in a quasi-peace, both the DPA and LNR forces had built up and trained their forces with Russian aid. The Ukrainians also built up forces and created a fortified line along main avenues of advance. Finally, sometime in 2020, Putin decided to try to get a larger section of the Ukraine in 2021. The offensive would be limited.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed by Perry Moore in 2020, this game seems prophetic on the battle of Kharkiv in Feb to May 2022. along with the use of Javelins and supply issues for the Russian army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
