						               													<description>It is that time of year! The little mice of the town must share their annual harvest among everyone in the town, as &amp;quot;evenly&amp;quot; as possible, but trying to keep the best part to become the... King/Queen of the Harvest Festival!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Harvest Festival is a no language dependent, family-friendly game that takes the mechanic &amp;quot;I cut, you choose&amp;quot; and gives it a little twist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In your turn you must play a single card in one of the piles that are in the plaza (Center of the Table) and if the card under the played card matches... You will be able to play another card!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beware! The time of the day will indicate if the card is played face up or facedown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Try to get rid of all your cards. This will give you a lot of points! In addition, if you no longer have cards, you can take one of the piles from the plaza to score at the end of the day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But there is a catch! The leftover pile on the plaza will go to the Mayor, The Festival Organizer! And this will dictate the value of each of the fruits and vegetables of the festival, making them worth many points... Or even zero!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And let's not forget the invited mice, each one of them that you take will ask you for food and if you are the host with the most mice fed, you will get a bonus!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So play your cards strategically, make the piles attractive to everyone and score as many points you can!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the 3 days of the festival, the player with the most points will be the winner! And the King/Queen of the Harvest Festival!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
