						               													<description>The year is 2023 and the world is buzzing with excitement as a groundbreaking new project is announced. A leading corporation in space exploration has unveiled its plans to build a lunar complex unlike any other. The name of this project is LUNARIS 45, and its goal is to create a fully operational lunar colony that will be run entirely by artificial intelligence.&amp;#10;As news of this project spreads, it captures the imagination of people all over the world. The idea of a self-sufficient lunar complex, with its own power sources, food production, and communication systems, is both ambitious and awe-inspiring. And with the use of advanced AI technology, the possibilities seem endless.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But as with any groundbreaking project, there are also concerns. Some wonder if the reliance on AI will make the colony vulnerable to malfunctions or even takeover by rogue AI. Others worry about the impact that such a project might have on the future of humanity.&amp;#10;To address the concerns of vulnerability surrounding the LUNARIS 45 project, the corporation has assembled a team of the world&amp;rsquo;s top experts in disaster response, AI safety, and cybersecurity. These scientists are tasked with identifying and anticipating any catastrophic scenarios that might arise from running a lunar colony entirely by AI.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But these experts are not paid in the usual way. Instead, they are offered a unique incentive: for every problem they solve, they will receive a generous amount of credits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This payment system ensures that the team is motivated to work tirelessly, leaving no stone unturned in their quest to make the LUNARIS 45 project as safe and secure as possible. From the possibility of a solar flare disrupting the colony&amp;rsquo;s power supply to the risk of rogue AI causing a catastrophic malfunction, the team of experts works to identify every conceivable problem and develop plans to mitigate them.&amp;#10;Players will take on the role of one of these experts. Players will use their knowledge and powerful computers to predict and solve any problem that may arise. Players will be upgrading these computers to achieve better results and solve even more complicated problems. Players will also be working in a vast network where they can share knowledge and achieve the optimal solution to the most varied problems.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will be rolling dice to match the values on problem cards in order to solve any catastrophic events. Players will be able to upgrade their inventory by buying more dice, more rerolls, and the opportunity to use the dice of other players. Every problem card solved will grant players credits that may be exchanged for Euros, but the more players upgrade the worst their conversion ratio of credits to euros becomes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
