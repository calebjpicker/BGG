						               													<description>During the American Revolution, no officer on the rebel side was a better field commander than Major General Benedict Arnold. This has been overlooked for well over two centuries; nothing is taught about Arnold except his treason. The fact is: if not for him, the rebellion would probably have failed and its principal players hanged. If he had died at Saratoga instead of being seriously wounded, his legacy would have been nothing short of legendary. Cities, counties and perhaps even a state would be named after him. Statues of Arnold would be standing in parks nationwide and his monument would be visited by throngs of people in the District of Columbia every day.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unfortunately, Arnold had enemies as well as supporters, and those enemies contributed significantly to his conclusion that the colonies were not yet ready for independence. In Benedict Arnold Poker, a breezy combination of poker and rummy, you will meet some of the men in each group, and Arnold himself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[Note: this game is an unfinished, although playable prototype. - ASF]&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
