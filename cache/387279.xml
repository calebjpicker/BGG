						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;The ocean animals need our help! In this cute board game, players race to collect plastic waste floating among the waves and take it to the ship, cleaning up the water to protect sea creatures.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#10;--description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Mission Ocean, each player is working to rescue their selected sea creature from the plastic waste that is encumbering that creature. Players are racing against each other to be the first to remove the 6 pieces of plastic waste from their creature and place the waste into &amp;ldquo;The Ocean Cleanup&amp;rdquo; ship. That ship is actually a 3D cardboard ship with a colored waste hold compartment matching the players&amp;rsquo; colors and is visually and tactilely engaging for young kids.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In essence, this is a &amp;ldquo;pick up and deliver&amp;rdquo; (in this theme &amp;ldquo;recover and dispose&amp;rdquo;) game simplified for young kids. It includes customized dice and tries to provide some real world context at an age appropriate level. This game is marketed as an ocean pollution educational game that is a fun way to internalize knowledge of how plastic waste affects sea life and part of the proceeds go to The Ocean Cleanup nonprofit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-User summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
