						               													<description>Retrieved from http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/67991987&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Advocate, Burnie, Tasmania, Australia, 31 Dec. 1932.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;CONTRACT WHIST.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No Hands Down.&amp;#10;WEAKNESS SOLVED.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Why a four-handed game of cards such as the various forms of bridge should be played by three persons is one of those mysteries that have never been explained. Probably this is because there is no explanation. It seems absurd that one of the four players should have to stand out of every game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And if the game is one of skill, as is confidently asserted, its value is much diminished by the exposure of one of the hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In whist each player knew only what was in his own hand. He had to use his reason or his imagination to decide what was in the hands of his partner or of his two opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Bridge Without the Dummy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the various forms of bridge his partner's hand is exposed once the bidding is over. Each player knows two hands, and so much of the real interest of the game is lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is these things that have led to the invention of contract whist, or &amp;quot;bridge without the dummy,&amp;quot; as set out by Hubert Phillips in &amp;quot;Contract Whist.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is distinctly a whist game, since each player plays his own hand. There is no exposure of one hand, as in bridge. It is this, the author claims, which gives the game its special fascination. And, indeed, it is a sensible idea.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the other hand, the bidding and scoring follow the lines of contract bridge, with changes and simplification.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As there is no recognised organisation to frame the rules of contract whist, the author has done it himself. He does not, however, claim to have invented the game. He says that the idea of bridge without the dummy has existed for years. The rule that only tricks actually contracted for can count towards the game is retained. The things rejected are, &amp;quot;Vulnerability, the bidding of slams, and unnecessarily complicated scoring.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;The Scoring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The scoring suggested is:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(1) A game is secured by the first side that scores 10 points. Rubber is the best of three games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(2) Points count toward game only when scored &amp;quot;below the line.&amp;quot; These are points for tricks which the declaring side has contracted to make. Tricks at No Trumps count 4 points each. Tricks at a suit declaration count 3 points each. Tricks made by the declarers, but not contracted for are scored above the line, and count only 2 each. Where a contract has been doubled or redoubled, the value of each trick is doubled or redoubled. Over tricks are 5 each doubled, and 10 redoubled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(3) Where the contract is defeated the defending side scores [above the line] 10 points for each trick which the declaring side has failed to make. If the contract has been doubled the deficiency score is 20 points; if redoubled 40.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(4) Nothing is scored for honors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(5) The side winning the rubber receives 50 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;Rubber of 100 Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The average rubber is about 100 points in all.&amp;#10;While the score is the same for all suit declarations, the preference in bidding is the same as in bridge--spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contract whist differs from bridge in that the play cannot be planned by the declarer from the outset.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The author gives many illustrations which suggest that contract whist could be made a most fascinating game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
