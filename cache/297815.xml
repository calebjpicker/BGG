						               													<description>Band Battle Royale is a fast-paced, music-themed, rock and role playing card game. Choose a unique band leader, find band members and equip them with epic gear. Take your band on tour where you wager fan cards and fight it out with your battle deck in a winner takes all competition. Be the last band standing and become a ROCK LEGEND.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The core game includes:&amp;#10;More Than 250 Cards&amp;#10;Over 150 Custom Illustrations&amp;#10;Casino-quality Cardstock&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is no wrong way to build your band!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How the game is played:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is comprised of 4 phases.  The BAND PHASE, TOUR PHASE, BATTLE PHASE, and MOP UP PHASE. During the BAND PHASE, you're dealt cards from the Band Deck. This deck comprises mostly of band members and gear. When all players have constructed their bands then starts the TOUR PHASE.  Cards from the Tour Deck are played until a venue card is played. Venue cards initiate the BATTLE ROUND. This is where each player receives cards from the Battle Deck and wagers their Fan Cards. All the players take turns playing cards to either increase your playlist points or decrease another player's points. After 3 cards are played by each player, points are tallied up and everybody moves on to the MOP UP PHASE. During this phase, all battle cards and band cards that were played during the battle round are cleaned up and the winner collects all the wagered Fan Cards. The BAND PHASE begins again and the cycle is repeated until either all Fan Cards belong to one player or the Tour Deck is depleted. Player with the most Fan Cards at the end of the game is crowned the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
