						               													<description>In this spin-and-move children's game based on The Wizard of Oz movie by MGM, players race for Home. The key to winning, however, is to arrive Home with a Magic Card in hand. The board depicts colorful characters and places in Oz &amp;quot;from the MGM movie, an annual television favorite&amp;quot; to recreate Dorothy's magical trip through Oz.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup: give each player a pawn and set the 4 Magic Cards on Home.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play is simple. Youngest player goes first. On his or her turn, the player spins the spinner. If the spinner points to a number, he or she moves her pawn that many spaces along the track:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     If the space his or her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has instructions for continuing the move such as to go ahead or move back a certain number of spaces, follow those instructions immediately.&amp;#10;     If the space his or her pawn lands on is unoccupied and has an M on it, the player receives a Magic card if he or she doesn't already have one, or returns his or her magic to the pile at Home if she does.&amp;#10;     If the space he or she lands on is already occupied (except Home - only Home may be occupied by more than one pawn), he or she must move her pawn back until she reaches an unoccupied space. When a player has to move back like this, any instructions on the space he or she moves back to are ignored.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the spinner arrow points to Magic Card instead of a number, the player takes a Magic Card if he or she doesn't have one, or returns his or her Magic Card if he or she already has one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues until someone reaches Home with a Magic Card. If a player reaches Home, but does not have a Magic Card, he or she can stay there, taking his or her turn as usual until he or she spins a Magic Card or another player reaches Home with a Magic Card (or without and spins one first).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
