						               													<description>DRIVE! A Better-Than-Bingo road trip game&amp;mdash;with the scavenger hunt elements everyone enjoys! Just take five cards in your hands &amp;amp; start spotting clues...in five widely-varied categories. Game is available as a Print &amp;amp; Play digital download via Etsy. Comes with rules and 72 printable cards. Overview: Each of the 5 decks of 12 cards is quite different from the rest. Every player receives one card from each deck. Players must complete their 5 cards in order...going from the D card, to the R card, to the I card, etc. until they've spelled Drive! Very portable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
