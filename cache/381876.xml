						               													<description>Build Your Army. Defeat Your Rival. Claim Your Birthright.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Erudia: Battle of Birthrights is a two player expandable card game featuring asymmetric tactics and strategies. Before the game begins, each player will select one of 96 unique deck combinations by drafting a primary and secondary class representing classical RPG archetypes and job systems. Players will then further customize their decks to create an additional layer of intrigue for their coming battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns advancing on battlefields which can be captured by multiple objectives. Players select up to three tactics to use each turn, with each tactic offering multiple options to ensure that no turn is wasted. These options include playing cards to advance their position on battlefields, activating abilities, strengthening their units, damaging rival units, and drawing cards to enhance their position. Battlefields are captured through area majority or through unique terrain based objectives which offer alternate means to victory. The game ends when one player has amassed 16 or more Victory Points from capturing battlefields and has claimed the throne of Erudia.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Erudia is unique in its design in that it contains a predetermined number of planned expansions that have been designed in advance, allowing for a single, consistent rulebook as well as narrative hints and spoilers of how the war unfolds. New classes and content will be added through expansions regularly, but Erudia also proudly features a Community Content Initiative where players get to collaboratively design actual content that will be included in the game. This Core Set contains two such classes, with more opportunities for involvement in the future. Overall, the Core Set contains 8 primary decks and 13 secondary decks for a total of 96 unique armies that are further customizable for endless replayability!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
