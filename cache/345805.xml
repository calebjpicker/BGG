						               													<description>Army of the Rhine is the fourteenth volume in Red Sash Games&amp;rsquo; Lace Wars series. This game is the last in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years' War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France&amp;rsquo;s borders. That was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King&amp;rsquo;s ultimate aim, that was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis&amp;rsquo; war of middle age &amp;ndash; a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men. There was not even supposed to be a war, only a demonstration of France&amp;rsquo;s power. France was engaged in a long process of securing her eastern and northeastern frontiers. Louis felt his prestige was on the line when some of his German neighbours &amp;ndash; specifically the Elector Palatine and the good burghers of Cologne &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;refused to give him what he wanted. A strong message needed to be sent. Also, by taking military action the French would put heart into the Turks, who were fighting a losing battle against the forces of the Holy League; keeping the Ottoman Empire in the game would ensure the Holy Roman Emperor could not support the minor powers who were the real object of King Louis&amp;rsquo; wrath. But, things did not go as planned. &amp;#10;  &amp;#10;In Army of the Rhine, you will have a chance to change history &amp;ndash; and perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books. As the Allied commander you lead a motley collection of troops. They are nearly all German, but that means very little. In the Empire, a prince only contributes greatly to the Cause if he expects to be greatly rewarded; otherwise, he will contribute as little as he thinks he can get away with. And, because the princes have the option to aid either Emperor Leopold or King William of England, they can play the one off against the other without being accused of letting the side down. Vienna may tell you to expect 30,000 men from Brandenburg, only to learn their Elector has chosen to fight in Brabant this year, because King William paid him in advance. And as for expecting help from the Emperor himself, forget it. French passivity in the face of your outstanding defense of the frontier last year has given him the excuse to siphon away yet more resources to his never-ending Hungarian war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
