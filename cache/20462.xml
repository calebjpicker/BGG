						               													<description>Zebrazucht.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Northern Germany&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The year is 2119.  Global warming has pushed northern Europe&amp;rsquo;s yearly average temperature to 27.7 C. The sale and breeding of exotic animals is one of the fastest growing businesses in the world. Breeding in captivity has become a necessity for the survival of most of the species existing 30 degrees longitude north and south of the equator. This massive area is so hot and dry that the remaining animals are simply fighting for survival and have no energy left for breeding. A massive movement to save these animals from extinction and the preservation of a living gene pool for genetic engineering has become the focus of many different organizations around the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Schleswig Holstein is the world leader in the art of genetically engineering exotic animals. They are highlighting and creating new traits in animals. Zebrazucht is a clinical experiment by two of the leading companies in the field of Genetics. One company genetically stripped male Zebras of most white coloration. The second company was able to genetically create female Zebras to be void of most of their black pigmentation. This six-year-old project is now in its final stages and the animals are being brought together for the first time in the height of mating season.  A special breeding facility was created to accommodate the project.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take on the role of scientists from both companies trying to bring as many pairs together as possible. The calculated end result should produce offspring Zebras that revert back to a more brilliantly stripped black and white color. If things go wrong the offspring might be hard to distinguish if placed amongst Holstein cows.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this two-player game players move two workers towards each other and place a fence of their colour in that space.&amp;#10;Once a player has four fences of his color surrounding a corral that player places his Zebra in the space.The person opening the most corrals to unite black &amp;amp; white Zebras wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
