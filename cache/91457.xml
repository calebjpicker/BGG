						               													<description>Number of players: 2&amp;ndash;5&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object of the game: Be first player to score 6 points, get 10 pieces in a row, or the last remaining player. Whenever a player scores, they move their figure from one side of the bluestone track to the other side.&amp;#10;Getting Started&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment: &amp;#10;The Stonehenge board.&amp;#10;10 disks of each color for each player.&amp;#10;1 figure per player, matching the set of colored disks that a player has.&amp;#10;Grey neutral figure (tracks where player removes piece from).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The outer track consists of 30 spaces, each with four parts, for each number (30 in all) from inside most to outside (making for a total of 120 spaces). In this game, the two day-night spaces, next to the number, on the inside are considered one space. The the next most outside space is the number space. After this comes the colored space. Outside most is a light or dark space. Each of these spaces is considered able to hold one piece in this game. As players place their pieces on the board, in a space, the first piece is put on the day-night space, the second on the number space, the third on the color space, and the last piece is placed on the light or dark space outer section.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overview of gameplay:&amp;#10;Players alternate turns putting their pieces on the board into one of four spaces on the outer track. A piece either immediately comes from their reserve, or it is taken from the board and put into their reserve and then played, if the player as no pieces in their reserve at the start of their turn. After a player places a piece on the board, pieces may end up sliding towards the inside part of the outer track, and then the board is checked for scoring conditions. If there are scoring conditions, pieces will be removed from the board and put into reserve(s) and scoring occurs. After this more pieces may end up sliding towards the inside part of the outer track and the scoring process is repeated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when one player scores 6 points (player's figure hits the last space on the bluestone track), gets 10 pieces in a row, or is the last remaining player. In event of a tie, all players not tied for win at the end of the game eliminated. Then the remaining players play until one player score more points than anyone else in the game. This player wins the game. Players eliminated from the game are treated as they normally would be in the game, with their pieces remaining on the board, but can't win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
