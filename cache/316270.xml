						               													<description>Creepstone Manor is empty again, the last &amp;lsquo;guest&amp;rsquo; running screaming into the night as Tinker, Creak, Giggle and Boo celebrate their victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But Spookie won&amp;rsquo;t let them rest on their laurels! The house is secure, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to turn your attention further afield and sort the gardens of Creepstone Manor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unfortunately, being a ghost has certain disadvantages. For one, handling a spade is tricky when your hand keeps passing straight through it! But help is on hand. The resurrected gardeners from the Manor&amp;rsquo;s heyday have returned to lend their rotted expertise to you. Use your crew of Zombies, Skeletons and Ghouls to grab plants and ornaments for your part of the garden; hire new crew members such as werewolves and vampires to boost your work and get those extra flowers planted before the night is over. But beware! Only those ghosts who show the greatest aesthetic eye will impress Spookie and be the best undead Haunticulturist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During their turn, players will bid for plant and ornament tiles using the monster cards they have in hand. Each monster has a gardening skill number (the higher the better) and up to two special abilities. During bidding, players will need to consider both the row and column their monsters are in when trying to grab those tokens. On top of this, if a player can play the third in a row of a particular monster type (say zombie or skeleton) they'll be rewarded with a boosted special ability on that card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players also can earn gold in the game, either through clearing 'junk' from their player board or various monster abilities. These can be used to hire 'special monsters' that have enhanced skills and abilities which the player keeps from round to round, replacing the basic monsters the player starts with.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After bidding, each player will place any plant tokens onto their personal flower bed (even the bad ones that score negative points!). How these are placed will affect the players' scores at the end of the game. How each plant will score can be varied by the players, changing the challenge from game to game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can also use the gold earned earlier to build any ornament tiles earned during bidding. Do you fill up on gnomes to get the highest score, or shoot for the all-or-nothing fountain?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally, players can earn points for a secret objective card selected at the beginning of the game. These feature a way to score that is unique to that player, and can be the difference between winning and losing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after four rounds, at which point each player tallies up their score for plants, ornaments and secret objectives with the highest score being crowned Head Haunticulturist!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Haunticulture also includes rules for solo play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
