						               													<description>Autumn Grove Manor is a co-op game for 2-6 players. A team of ghost hunters, armed with only Lord Latimer's Journal, must collect 6 gems which can be combined to create a 'weapon' to defeat Palmershu, the Demon God, who has claimed the manor as his own. You'll have to exorcise the ghosts, while avoiding holes in the ground and searching the manor for items and gems, but beware, Palmershu may appear at the end of any round, and he's not pleased that you're trying to exorcise him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is set up by shuffling the room cards, placing them upside down on the board so each room can't be seen and placing all the players at the front door and all the ghosts and the Palmershu marker are placed in the cloth bag.&amp;#10;During Part 1 A player has 8 action points each turn, which can be used for moving, exorcising ghosts, using items, giving an item to an ally, or opening chests or doors. Once a player opens either a chest or a door, they've alerted the ghosts to their presence and their turn immediately ends and they turn over a card from the ghost deck.&amp;#10;During the end of turn players must add more ghosts onto the board using a pair of D20 dice pulling ghosts (or Palmershu) randomly from the bag.&amp;#10;The aim of Part 1 is to search the house for 6 gems, spread across the house in the different rooms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Part 2 the board is flipped and Palmershu starts his final attack as the team attempt to destroy him. &amp;#10;All the items you've collected in part 1 are carried over and can be played any round before anyone rolls to attack. The number of gems you collected will decreases the number of cards revealed for where Palmershu will appear.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part 2 is split into 5 sections:&amp;#10;Palmershu's Arrival&amp;#10;From the Palmershu Deck reveal the correct number of card (the more gems you found in Part 1, the less places he may attack from)&amp;#10;Character Actions&amp;#10;The Characters can then use items and move up to 3 spaces in any order.&amp;#10;Palmershu Appears&amp;#10;The top card of Palmershu's attack deck is revealed which reveals which card and which power is used.&amp;#10;Characters Attack&amp;#10;The Characters who are in range of Palmershu or ghosts then attack them.&amp;#10;Palmershu Attacks&amp;#10;Finally the ghosts and Palmershu will attack the Characters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win the game the team must defeat Palmershu. However if all the ghosts are removed from the bag then the team must flee the house and the game is lost, or if any player loses all their hearts then the game is lost.&amp;#10;There are 4 levels of difficulty, which vary the number of ghosts on the board to begin and the number that appear each turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
