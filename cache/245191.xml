						               													<description>Throw your chips onto an unstable turntable and be the first to get rid of all your chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The equipment is like a turn-table. There is a spring on which you place a cap, with a pointed top facing up. The top is to serve as spindle for the turntable. All 32 chips are divided equally among the players who sit down (or stand) at a certain distance from the turntable. Minimum distance should be 30cm, measured between the clenched fist (arms outstretched)and the centre of the turntable. &amp;#10;The object of the game is, for each player to try to get rid of his stock of chips, as quickly as possible. Players try to do so, when it is their turn, by throwing a least one chip onto the turntable, after which they may give the next player his turn. However, if a player thinks he will be able to get rid of more than one chip during one and the same turn, he may go on throwing chips onto the turntable. But mind this: if, during a player's turn, chips fall of the turntable, his turn is over, and he must add the fallen chips to his stock.&amp;#10;In case a player, when it is his turn, feels it would be too risky to try and throw chips onto the turntable, because he is afraid many chips may then fall off, that player may throw one of his chips and miss, deliberately. In other words: he may try to throw his chip in such a way, that it will bounce off the top side of the turntable. There must have been contact.&amp;#10;The player who first gets rid of all his chips, wins the game. Players may also agree to play several rounds, to have one final winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
