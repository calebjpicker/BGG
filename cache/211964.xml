						               													<description>To The Last Extremity recreates the 21-day siege of Fort Stanwix in 1777 during The American Revolution. Any number of decisions or events could have altered the outcome, and 'To The Last Extremity' gives players the chance to see what might have been.&amp;quot; --from the rule book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In To The Last Extremity the forces of the fledgling United States of America, consisting of Continental Army infantry and artillery, local militia, and allied Oneida Indian units, face off against the besieging forces consisting of British Army infantry and artillery, Hessian J&amp;auml;gers, Canadian militia, and American Indian allies. Each side receives a deck of cards representing its military forces and the various leaders instrumental in the campaign, such as the American commander, Col. Peter Gansevoort, and the British commander, Brig. Gen. Barry St. Leger, plus many others (including American Indian leaders and Benedict Arnold before he turned traitor!).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players face off on opposite sides of a period map of the area surrounding Fort Stanwix. At the beginning of each turn, the American player will roll to see if a Chance card is drawn. Chance cards introduce historical events into the game and their effects on one or both sides. The rule book has detailed historical descriptions of each event, which are informational only, but help to bring the history and drama of the Siege of Fort Stanwix to life. Following a possible Chance card draw, players will secretly assign forces and leaders to each of the four sides of Fort Stanwix: north, south, east, and west. How the players choose to distribute their forces will determine the outcome of the siege. Players then reveal their cards. If the British have assigned forces to assault one or more sides of the fort, players will compare the strengths of the opposing forces on that side and roll a die to determine the resultant casualties and whether a breach of the fortress walls has occurred. If the British achieve two breaches on the same turn, they have taken the fort and win the game. If, after 13 turns, the British fail to take the fort, the outnumbered Americans have broken the siege and have defeated the British.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, the British may also elect to dig entrenchments to protect their artillery, or bombard or skirmish with sides of the fort to effect American morale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Easily playable in under an hour, &amp;quot;To The Last Extremity&amp;quot; is a simple wargame that provides a great deal of historical flavor surrounding one of the earliest American victories achieved in U.S. history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
