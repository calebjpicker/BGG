						               													<description>Theme and goal&amp;#10;In Miner the players steps in the role of hardworking Miners. The Miners are searching for resources like gold and iron on a 3D Game Board. To be more efficient they have to upgrade their shovels and pickaxes and can buy additional ropes. With negotiation skills they have to sell the mined resources on the market. &amp;#10;The player which earns the most money wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;The special thing about Miner is its unique 3D sandbox in the middle of the game board. The sandbox includes 180 massive resource blocks. Hidden under soil there are stone, coal, iron and gold, that want to be discovered. The player steps in the role of a miner. With negotiating skill they try to sell the mined resources on the market for a good price. &amp;#10; Each round a player has 10 hours to perform actions. Every action costs time, which is displayed on the player&amp;rsquo;s game tableau. When there is no time left the player can knock off work and the next player begins his turn. &amp;#10; What actions a player can choose?&amp;#10;The key element of the game is the 3D sandbox. Inside of it every player has a game character. In the sandbox the player can move, climb or mine resources. In the beginning of the game all players are standing on soil, but the deeper they dig, the more exciting it will be.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But that's easier said than done. Every player starts with only one rope. So if you want to dig deeper you should better buy some additional ropes in the town. With the mined resources you can go to the market. But be careful, the prices shown by the resource dice are changing every round. When you don&amp;rsquo;t want to sell the mined resources you have to store them in a warehouse. Every player owns a warehouse on his private deck. There are also 4 warehouses in the town available which can be rented.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you want to rank among the best, you soon have to go to the forge and buy better tools. Of course some coins have to be reinvested but with better pickaxe your mining will be much more efficient.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If there is some time left, you can work for the day laborer to earn some coins or you can visit the tavern. In the tavern you can get some benefit cards which can really make the difference.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With all these actions you can plan your turn. If there is no time left you have to wait for the next round. Plan your turns clever and you will have the right resources at the right time. The player who owns the most coins after 14 rounds wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
