						               													<description>You are a farm owner at the end of the XIX Century, but in a pretty weird world, after weird experiments vegetables have come alive and crazy events can make your plan change in a second. Plant crops, buy animals, ghater resources, manufacture products, construct buildings, achieve missions and get those Victroy Points to Win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 5 basic resources (tomato, raspberry, wood, wheat and Corn). You start the game drawing 5 resource cards from the Resource deck, drawing 1 Annual Mission (1 mission/place card and 2 mission/order cards) and drawing 1 Reward Card. Also you place your mini-gameboard in front of you. Resources pay everything, wood for buildings and different costs for Manufacture products and buying/feeding animals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of each season, you fulfill your hand till have 5 cards, but of course this are randomly drawed from Resource deck, and you cannot give it all to random cause you have only 4 season to complete &amp;quot;on time&amp;quot; your mission, and receive the bonus and a Reward card, and there is when Planting crops become important.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of each year, each player receives a new annual mission by drawing a mission/place card and 2 mission/order mini-cards. To obtain the bonus specified by the mission/place card as well as a reward, both missions/orders must be completed in time (by the end of the year.).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Resource card have the &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot; of planting the crop in the upright corner (i.e Tomato have 2), so to plant, just place a resource card/crop on the table and discard the cards necessary from your hand. ONE token is then placed on the first blank space, in the next turn you place another token or harvest if ready (The crop is ready for harvest on the turn after the last token has been placed). The harvested crops represented by tokens are placed in their corresponding space in the barn, and the card return to your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each card lists the products that can be manufactured that resource. To manufacture simply pay the cost using either resource cards, and/or resources token stored in the barn, (the cards used go to the discard pile and tokens used are back to the token pile). Then place a token on its corresponding place on the shelve. You may manufacture as many products as desired (or posible) per turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 2 kinds of buildings in the game. Common buildings (Stables, Dairy, Henhouse, Sheep Yard), each player can build his own.  And uniques buildings (Train Station, General Store, Inn, and Workshop).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends after 12 rounds/seasons, after which the player with the highest amount of victory points wins. Victory points obtained during the game (by completing missions) are added to the points given by Resources,  products and buildings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
