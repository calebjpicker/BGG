						               													<description>In Theme Park, players take on the role of theme park managers that all work for the Earl Synergy Company, an entertainment giant that has spent the last 75 years making movies, television and theme parks for families around the world. Players get to run their own regional Synergyland theme park. Over the course of four years, each player makes the best use of his management team and resources to maximize his own Synergyland's performance by building out his parks; ensuring the right mix of attractions, shops and shows to draw tourists to his park; taking advantage of marketing opportunities to promote his own parks, both building overall attendance and his own block of it; and developing out his roster of executive staff. The player with the most victory points (including special &amp;quot;Brownie Points&amp;quot; for being a &amp;quot;company man&amp;quot;) at the end of four years becomes the new CEO of the Earl Synergy Company and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn in Synergyland, players place their differently skilled executive pieces on the various company spaces to claim resources, attractions, shows, marketing opportunities and other items that will help build out their park so they can grab the highest attendance and revenue when the tourists are distributed throughout the year. Each year, different factors will affect the company as a whole, new marketing campaigns and brands will be developed that executives may or may not want to harness to drive the masses to their parks. But the trick to getting more value out of your company executives is that the more they collaborate, the better the synergy. When more than one executive is placed on a specific location, they generate more of an advantage, a more valuable park addition or a greater marketing campaign or they just make the item cheaper in the long run &amp;ndash; although there are certainly some times when too much help means too many ideas...so be careful to get into that &amp;quot;sweet spot&amp;quot; for collaboration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
