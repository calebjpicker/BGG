						               													<description>Our Great Game is a board game which simulates the game of Australian Rules Football.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was probably first published in the 1920s by the National Game Company. Several versions exist. Two versions are produced on a thick backing either 36cm x 36cm or 48 x 31cm. Common to all versions is the wording 'Our Great Game' on the inside board.  The box or board covers have various titles, including 'The National Football game', 'Our Great Game' or 'The Game of Football'. All but one version has the playing field angled across the board. Later copies were printed on thin card, boxed with the logo (but not on the board), including those published by Westley games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As with the real form of the sport scores are kept for two teams (Yellow and Red team in the game) and 4 quarters are played with the duration decided by the players. The scores are 6 points for a goal (through the tall posts) and 1 point for a behind (number 31 in the game). Play starts by the sum of two dice. A disc (ball) is placed at that players feet that corresponds to the number. (i.e If 6 and 2 are rolled, player 8 Red team has the ball) If the player is in the defensive zone (closer half of their opponents goal) the next roll of the dice must be subtracted (i.e If player 8 (Red Team) rolls a 1 the next player to receive the ball is 8 - 1 = 7. If the red team is still in possession they keep rolling the dice but if the number turns it over to the yellow team then its their roll of the dice. When the player is forward of their center line, then they are deemed to be in attack. In this case instead of subtracting the dice roll they must add. (i.e Player 7 (Red Team) is forward of center so they roll say a 3 - the next player to receive the ball is 10 (7 + 3). Movement and scoring is done in this way. If a behind is scored the ball is placed on player 29 of the opposing team to kick out. The highest score after 4 quarters is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
