						               													<description>Skyline Express - the first aerial train needs a manager. Organise your carriage as best as you can by properly placing passengers, offering them services and paying attention to their individual preferences. Prove that you are the right person to manage the Skyline Express!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skyline Express is an easy entry family board game. On your turn pick a passenger from the waiting line and place them in your carriage. Sounds easy, right? Not necessarily. In order to win you need to concentrate and control the constantly changing situation on the board. Observing the actions of other players, adjusting your strategy to the current round and making sure you fill individual passengers' preferences shows that becoming a manager of an aerial train is not an easy task.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game uses familiar mechanisms such as pattern building, set collection, tile placement and action selection and merges them into a fun experience for everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s sure to appeal to fans of games such as Azul, Sagrada and Reef.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points after 3 rounds. At the end of every round each player sums up all the points they earned in 3 different ways:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GOALS&amp;#10;SERVICES&amp;#10;PERSONAS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn players pick a passenger from the current waiting line to then place in their carriage. Additionally, the player may also perfom actions and aquire SERVICE tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 6 types of passengers in the game. For example, one passenger is considered a PERSONA and has a specific preference tile that goes along with them. The Preference tile indicates where the PERSONA would like to be seated and what passengers they&amp;rsquo;d like to sit with. Fulfill the Persona's preferences and earn big points!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every round has 2 GOALS that give victory points if fulfilled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For every full compartment players receives a ticket token. Once they've acquired 2 ticket tokens they can then spend them to buy a SERVICE tile. A SERVICE tile gives victory points for every pair of passengers of the types shown on the tile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A round ends once all passengers from the Main Hall have been placed in the players' carriages. Players sum up their victory points and the next round begins with new passengers filling up the Main Hall. The game ends after the scoring phase of round 3. The player with the most victory points becomes the manager of the Skyline Express.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
