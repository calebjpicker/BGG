						               													<description>&amp;quot;You don't know the power of the plug!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards and rules in an envelope, following the Cheapass design philosophy.  The premise is that the players are trying to get the landlord's attention by plugging up the toilet in their apartment with anything they can find on the theory that, while the toilet is being fixed all the other things wrong with the apartment will be fixed also.  Having lived in off-campus apartments during college, I can relate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is given a playing mat with a picture of a toilet on it and is dealt one card.  On each player's turn they may draw from 0-2 cards and play one card, either on their own toilet or another player's.  The winner is the first person to exactly reach a predetermined level of points worth of stuff in their toilet (20 points for a two player game, 18 for three, etc.)  Some cards are worth negative points and are played on opponents.  That person must then remove that many points worth of stuff from their toilet.  If they don't have any cards small enough (say a -2 card was played, for instance) they must discard a larger card (Baby Brother [+5] for instance) and accept the greater loss--no making change allowed.  There are also Pet cards.  While a player has a Pet card next to their toilet they cannot win even if their toilet is full to the required score--the landlord doesn't allow pets.  They may discard the Pet card, but this counts as their entire action for the turn and they may not draw or play any other cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each copy of Super Plug also comes with 5 blank cards.  Players are encouraged to create cards of their own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
