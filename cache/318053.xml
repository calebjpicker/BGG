						               													<description>Trafalgar Scenario Pack&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During 1804 and 1805, Napoleon wanted to seize the English Channel for just one week and place a French army on British soil. To do so, the fleets of Spain and France must combine in order to have any chance against the Royal Navy. The British Admiralty, conducting a brilliant campaign of blockade, could not let Napoleon succeed. But the net is never woven as tightly as the Admiralty desires, and the enemy slips out to sea. In the Fall of 1805 Napoleon's fleets are off the coast of Spain and poised to sail against Britain and her allies. But French Admiral Pierre Villeneuve does not know the whereabouts of the British fleet that has been chasing him for months. Where is his nemesis Horatio Nelson? Off the coast of Spain, Villeneuve loses his nerve and orders his combined fleet to reverse course and return to the safety of Cadiz. On this fateful day, in light winds, Nelson has tracked him down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed for play with the popular age of sail game, Fire As She Bears! (2.1), these scenarios place you in either the role of the feared Royal Navy or the beleaguered French and Spanish fleets. Can you change the course of history and turn Nelson's victory into his defeat?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Battle of Trafalgar Scenario Pack contains...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Four scenarios from the climactic year of 1805:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Calder's Action, 22 July 1805 (15 pages) - 15 British Ships of the Line square off against 14 French and 6 Spanish warships.&amp;#10;    Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (24 pages) - the mother of all naval battles (60 ships).&amp;#10;    Collingwood at Trafalgar, hypothetical (3 pages) - what if Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood had commanded the Royal Navy at Trafalgar?&amp;#10;    Strachan's Action, 3 November 1805 (8 pages) - Four British vs. four French. The perfect introductory scenario for &amp;quot;Fire As She Bears! - 2nd Edition&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each includes a scenario overview, special rules, weather status, victory conditions, ship record sheets, and a set up map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special Bonus: Also included in the scenario pack are ten pages of rules modifications for converting FASB2 from a miniatures game, for play as a traditional hex based wargame. There are six pages of revised charts needed for these new hex based rules. This is a great opportunity for traditional boardgamers to experience this popular age of sail game. If you've previously shied away from Fire As She Bears! as a miniatures game, now with the core 2.1 rules and this scenario pack, you can experience this fleet level wargame.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To go along with this, we've included two 8.5&amp;quot; x 11&amp;quot; pages of full color &amp;quot;print and play&amp;quot; ship silhouette counters (80 different ships, each rated for FASB2). Designed to complement the hex based rules, these counters are ideal for those who don't have a fleet of miniatures or those who want to get into action quickly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This pdf weighs in with over 60 pages of rules, scenario data, and play aids. We've broadened the horizons of the Fire As She Bears! system by including hex play, as well as, bringing together scenarios recreating one of the most dramatic years in naval history. We hope you enjoy our efforts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These rules and scenarios are designed for play with the 2nd Edition of Fire As She Bears! Ownership of that rule system is necessary for the full enjoyment of the Battle of Trafalgar Scenario Pack. The optional signaling system &amp;quot;Hoist Signals Aloft!&amp;quot; is not necessary for play (but we hope you'll use it anyway to get the feel of commanding a fleet at sea during the age of sail).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
