						               													<description>Dress your character as creatively as you can and hide him behind the wardrobe. Now your opponent, based on deductions, must try to dress his character as you have done. If he guesses correctly, he wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player receives a game board which they place in front of them with the undressed character.&amp;#10;Each player receives a full set of clothes.&amp;#10;One game has two rounds and each round has three steps: &amp;#10;1: Player 1 dresses their character&amp;#10;2: Player 2 uses their intuition to dress their character then asks player 1 to validate their guess using the validation counters. &amp;#10;3: If player 2 has correctly guessed all three items of clothing win their round. If they have guessed any of the clothes incorrectly, they have to interpret the validation counters to deduce the correct combination. Then, player 2 repeats step 2, modifying their character&amp;rsquo;s outfit and asking for a new validation. &amp;#10;If player 2 does not guess the winning combination after five attempts, they lose their round.&amp;#10;The number of attempts is marked on the counter panel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the first round has finished, the players switch roles and play a second round: player 1 becomes player 2 and vice versa.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If both players have won a round each, the winner is the person who won their round with the least number of guesses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
