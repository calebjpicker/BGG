						               													<description>Manafolds is a fantasy-themed trick-taking/area control game. You lead a faction that is aligned primarily with one of six manafold types. Manafolds, also called &amp;ldquo;folds&amp;quot;, are magical locations, each with unique characteristics. You seek to deepen your knowledge of the folds, channeling energies from them to best your rivals and gain the most Prestige.&amp;#10; You win a game of Manafolds by having the most Prestige after three Ages or being the first player to reach 20 Prestige, whichever comes first. The majority of Prestige points that you can earn come from securing Titles. Titles can be granted through ruling manafolds, fulfilling card-based objectives, and other unique goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Age consists of four Encounters, preceded by a bidding session to determine the player who will lead the Age&amp;rsquo;s first Encounter and dictate which fold is exalted (i.e. the &amp;ldquo;trump&amp;rdquo; suit). Exalting a manafold suit grants you the privilege of setting the Titles that provide Prestige points, and the exalter must make their bid in points from these Titles in order to avoid losing any Prestige.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of each Encounter, the lead player will take a turn, which involves playing an Encounter Card from their hand and taking some actions. Some of these actions for example will let you move your units between manafolds, deploy more units, attack other factions, and increase your chances of winning encounters. In turn order, each other player will similarly take some actions and play an Encounter Card, following suit if able. After all players go, the winner is determined, which is the player whose played card is in the lead suit with the highest power, unless bested by an exalted-suit card. The winner chooses an Encounter Effect (a boon from any one of the played cards), claims all played cards, and leads the next encounter. After all encounters have been resolved for a given Age, Prestige is awarded, followed by a transition to the next Age. &amp;#10; As the game arcs, players will be deepening their skill and understanding of the folds (making corresponding actions stronger), gaining more mana discs to be able to take more actions during their turns, and acquiring powerful Relics, further enhancing their own unique action tableaus. Will your faction be immortalized through the tales of the people, or will you be forsaken? Only time will tell&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
