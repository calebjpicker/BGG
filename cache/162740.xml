						               													<description>About the Game:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is an abstract game designed, created and published by me, Magdala Ramirez.  Games people Play is a board game that dares you to go on a quest within the self to uncover your spiritual path. It will take you into the cycles that you encounter in your life and help you to understand how you have evolved. In this world of duality, the system created separation and disconnection within the people. It happened over and over again. Soon, people stopped be-living in themselves and an inner battle began. Chaos, destruction and sadness came into being in the outside world as the human beings became more disconnected and dysfunctional within themselves. Human beings got caught in the cycles that created turmoil within them and peace was no where to be found, until now.  Now the human beings are ready to reach themselves by embracing and uncovering the cycles within the self. They are ready to integrate their hearts and birth a higher perception of themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Play :&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is an ancient game of serpents and arrows. The arrows make your energy go up and the serpents take your energy down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Role a dice and use your marker to move across the board. Read about the number you land on and meditate why you are there and where you are going, and where the synchronicity of the dice will take you. You can start if you throw a one on your dice. Then, the game begins! Use as a board marker something personal that has your energy. It could be a ring, a stone, a crystal etc. As you proceed in the game, you are led to different houses  and  the meaning of each house that you enter into during the game is written in the book that comes with the game.&amp;#10;        &amp;#10;     You win when you became a God-Goddess, the number 68, having perfect control of yourself and using your feminine power with all its divine implications. Meditate on this. Meditate in your circle. You will find this game a beautiful tool to knowing yourself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
