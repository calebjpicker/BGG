						               													<description>Sexual communication is an extremely important part of any healthy relationship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Satisfy is a game where two players act as partners, each trying to satisfy each other&amp;rsquo;s needs by following clues and trying their best to finish as simultaneously as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players each have a set of increasingly difficult secret Goals that they want to try to satisfy before their hand or the Stimulation Deck runs out of cards. These goals represent different arrangements of the markers on the Shared Experience board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inspired by such games as Fog of Love and Codenames, Satisfy will exercise your empathy and understanding by putting both of you in a vulnerable and often hilarious place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Satisfy, both players will take turns moving markers along the Shared Experience Board. Each column on the board represents a different aspect of a sexual encounter:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Voice&amp;#10;     Touch&amp;#10;     Mouth&amp;#10;     Genitals&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both players will be moving the four markers up and down these tracks to match the increasingly difficult goal cards in front of their partner. There are five levels of goal cards, and once one is matched it is replace by one of the next higher level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To move these markers, the players will take turns playing Stimulation cards. These cards indicate two colors whose markers will be pushed. As you play the card, you describe to &amp;#10;your partner what you&amp;rsquo;re doing to them. Played cards are handed to your partner who adds them to their own hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you match your goal, your partner will draw an Action card. These can be used assist you in your experience. When a final goal is met, begin discarding your Stimulation cards in a race to both finish as close to the same time as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Inclusivity&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All pronouns used in the game are non-gendered. This is a game for couples of any orientation or persuaion. The art on the cards features gay, straight, lesbian, and non-binary people.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is intended for any couple willing to explore how they communicate with each other and are willing to have a fun time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
