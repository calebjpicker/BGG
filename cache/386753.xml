						               													<description>Who doesn't want to relive 2020?!  Right?  No?  Nobody???  Well, maybe if we could look back and laugh at it, right?  (Or is it too soon to bring up the election?  Or the absence of toilet paper?  Or the inception of mandatory mask wearing?)  Well...it's funny in the game, anyway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 2020 The Game, 2-6 players roll-and-move their way around the board, trying to acquire (read: &amp;quot;land on and not lose later&amp;quot;) 270 electoral votes, FTW.  As you &amp;amp; your opponents use some of the best movers ever made (no lie&amp;mdash;you can BE the toilet paper!!!), learn how many electoral votes come from each state in the union &amp;amp; cheer each other on as you all get closer to ending the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They thought of EVERYTHING for this one, folks!  The [Community Chest/Chance style] cards have every bit of the flavor of 2020, with a clean art style &amp;amp; tongue-firmly-in-cheek.  If you missed it IRL, now you can finally host your own &amp;quot;super-spreader event&amp;quot; or stage your own &amp;quot;peaceful protest&amp;quot;, but whatever you do, don't get sent back to quarantine!  (Those dang variants...)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
