						               													<description>Carthage was founded by nobles from the Phoenician city of Tyre and from Cyprus. From the start it was a complete and independent city on a spot with favorable access to important resources such as clay and sea salt. Carthage in North Africa then became the cradle and center of the Punic state which spread across the Mediterranean. Carthage's military traditions showed its Phoenician roots and reflected native Libyan and Greek influences.&amp;#10;It has traditionally been argued that Carthage was a peaceful city of merchants or a brutal colonial power and both theories were rather dependent upon modern perceptions. Almost all approaches towards Carthage have in common the fact that they do not look at Carthaginian policy-making as such, but rather its structure in a fundamental contrast to that of Rome. However, the polis Carthage was over the course of several centuries the dominant power in the Western Mediterranean and could establish its authority over large territories which were also deeply influenced by the Punic culture.&amp;#10;Ancient authors tend to stress the reliance of Carthage on foreign mercenaries. However, the term 'mercenary' is misleading when applied to the African and Spanish recruits, i.e. from areas controlled by Carthage. They were comparable to Roman Auxilia though Carthage did also employ mercenaries in the true sense as well. These units were mostly deployed in the expeditionary armies overseas, while in Africa Punic militias formed the backbone of the troops. Units were generally segregated by ethnicity which was also a criterion for the respective specialisation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Get Some! Fantasy Warfare is about getting your models out and playing an enjoyable wargame for a couple of hours with your buddies. It is NOT about WAAC (Winning at all Costs) but about designing an army that fits your collection and play style as well as the background for the Universe you are playing in. Tactics and Command should play the pivotal roles in the battel as well as a little bit of Luck and NOT pimped out units. Armies should be a mix of Melee, Ranged and Magical/Monsterous units. Each should check some of the power of the others in the rock, paper, scissors kind of way, which is similar to actual warfare.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;ndash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
