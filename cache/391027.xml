						               													<description>Clash of Corgis is a strategic card shedding game for 2-4 players. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards in their hand and field.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played over several rounds. In each round, players take turns going clockwise around the table, playing cards from their hand or field to the center of the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players must play increasingly higher ranked cards to continue playing the round. Plus, each rank has a special effect that triggers when it is played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The special effects of the cards add a new layer of strategy to the game, as players will need to consider not only the rank and suit of the card they play, but also its special ability and how it can be used to gain an advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
