						               													<description>A two-player card game based on BCU (Baniak Cthulhu Universe) - well-known in Poland streamed RPG sessions.&amp;#10;In this game your goal is to arrange played cards on the board in such a way as to lure the opponent to your side of madness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning, each player must build their investigator deck up to a maximum of 20 cards with a mix of enemies, vehicles, items, artefacts, gods. Remember that they should be connected with each other by at least one of the three keywords.&amp;#10;Investigators and enemies have high attributes; while vehicles move other cards; items, spells and artefacts are weaker but can perform special actions; and outer gods bring huge changes in the world (board), but require an opened gate.&amp;#10;Cards (in a well-assembled deck) will resonate with each other causing mayhem on the board and creating un-obvious traps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players alternately play one card at a time, trying to turn the opponent's cards to their side (light or dark). We do this with the attributes on the sides of the cards and their special abilities.&amp;#10;You cannot hide cards in your hands, you must play either from the top of the pile or from the two available slots in the stash. So the cards are open to both players and we can try to anticipate his movements. But so is he! Whoever gets more followers at the end wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
