						               													<description>You may notice that your daily comms are filling with slang, shorthand, and emojis, all of which are autocorrected by technology that knows what you're about to say or think. Thankfully there is a task force fighting back against this linguistic corruption.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your task, as a Defender of the Dictionary, is to fight the evil forces threating our language. Your weapon is your collective wisdom, but you must use your words to navigate the city in time to stop the evil villains from ruining language forever. After all, knowledge is freedom, and it must be preserved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In defenders of the dictionary, players will cooperate to navigate the city of Wordopolis via letter-and-grid based wordplay.  Each mission you will need to achieve a particular task going a particular direction with your words before running out of turns. Complete a mission to gain more intel about the villains, advance your campaign, and bank points that can be used to upgrade your defender hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Defenders of the Dictionary takes the well known gameplay of grid-based word games and flips it on its head.  You will need to learn how to work together within this system, navigate particular directions, and deal with all of the traps and setbacks the villain have set for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The campaign is constructed with many short games and held together by an overarching meta-puzzle.  You can choose to pursue any villain, but apprehending certain villains early in the campaign may help improve your chance at success.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
