						               													<description>Introducing Greedy Wizards  - a two-player card game in which a red wizard battles a blue wizard for the right to eat a delicious cake.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning pieces of cake will take you closer to victory - whilst also making it more difficult to claim the next hand. Strategy, maths, probability and bluffing combine to make this a game unlike any other.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each wizard holds nine spell cards numbered from one to nine. As our wizards are more &amp;quot;Greedy&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;Gandalf&amp;quot;, their spell-casting abilities leave a little to be desired -  making their spells a little on the unusual side. The game's incantations include things like summoning an &amp;ldquo;absolutely massive chicken&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;a woman who shouts hurricanes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take it in turns to secretly select and then lay three spell cards face down, either side of a duel token. This is repeated until each wizard has played all nine of the cards they hold. Duels are resolved by adding up the total value of cards - with the wizard with the highest winning that particular scrap. Win two duels out of three and a piece of cake becomes theirs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, three pieces of cake are needed to win the game - and because our Wizards are Greedy, they value cake over spells. Winning a piece of cake means discarding a spell card. And as the cake cards are double-sided, the opposing wizard can see exactly when they are being played. When cake is in play, the game becomes one of strategy, bluffing and probability - do you have what it takes to get your cake and eat it?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beautifully illustrated, easy to learn yet full of decisions and intrigue, it&amp;rsquo;s a game which can be enjoyed by any level of player. As long as they are greedy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
