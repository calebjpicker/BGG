						               													<description>A tactical and cooperative card game for 1-2 players, in Kinfire Delve: Vainglory's Grotto you will fight your way through the Well deck of challenge cards to reach Vainglory, the Master of the Well, and face them in an epic final battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vainglory's Well is made up of four challenge cards, with Vainglory herself in the middle. As a challenge is defeated, another takes its place, with 52 challenge cards in total. As you face the challenges of the Well, you may only play a skill card from your hand that matches the color of the challenge card. That is, if you&amp;rsquo;re facing a red challenge card, then you may only play a red skill card. Some cards will have two colors, and some cards are white, or wild. If the card you play does not defeat the challenge, you'll be able to add some progress to it, and attempt it again, though you may suffer a penalty for doing so. Other Seekers can provide help by playing one of their own cards as a boost, but beware. Running out of cards nets you an Exhaustion before you can draw a new hand. Exhaustion cards are never good, but some are worse than others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Defeating a challenge will provide you a reward, such as regaining health or delving deeper into the Well, which is represented by discarding unseen challenge cards. Once you've made your way to the bottom of the Well, you'll face Vainglory herself. All Seekers share a health pool, and if the pool reaches zero, you're defeated. This is a game that requires teamwork.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
