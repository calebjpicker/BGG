						               													<description>Se Rappeler, also known as &amp;quot;Fun to Remember&amp;quot; is a box containing the components to play a series of children's memory games:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Pairs Memory Game - the traditional &amp;quot;Memory&amp;quot; game where players turn over two cards at a time trying to make matched pairs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The Countryside Game - On a board depicting an outdoor scene, a player arranges several pieces in the empty spaces and shows it to the other player.  The first player then secretly changes one or two pieces and shows it again to the other player, who must identify the changes.  Players take turns until one has identified ten changes correctly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Kim's Game - Players take turns being the dealer.  They place 20 silhouette pictures on the table, give other players a few seconds to look and then secretly remove one or more.  Players then must mark on their board which pieces have been removed, keeping the markers for correct guesses.  After each player has been dealer twice, the player with the most markers wins.  &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     What Followed Next? - Players start with a set of eight pictures face-down.  The first player chooses a picture, looks at it, says aloud what it is and then places it face-down, starting a row.  The second player chooses a second tile, looks and then must say the name of the first and second tiles in order.  The third player must name the first two tiles in order and then his or her newly-drawn tile.  This continues until a player thinks another has made a mistake and calls for a check.  The tiles are checked and whichever player is wrong is eliminated.  Play includes until only one player remains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     In the Pocket Game - Each player has a board depicting 20 objects.  Silhouette tiles of these objects form a supply.  In turn, each player chooses a silhouette and hides it.  The player to the left then asks a yes/no question about the item (e.g. &amp;quot;is it round?&amp;quot;).  If the answer is no, the next player asks a question.  If the answer is yes, the asker may guess the identity of the item.  If correct, the player receives the tile and places it in the correct space on his or her board.  If incorrect, the next player may take a turn.  The player who wins the tile becomes the next to choose a tile and answer questions.  The first player to get five tiles wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
