						               													<description>This is the first expansion of Rad Zone Totality and is designed to be used in conjunction with the core rules. It includes the search matrix for the Science Laboratory and the building map. All the search matrix references for the map are found below, so this is a totally new location and map for your survivors.&amp;#10;The Science Lab (SCL) search matrices are listed first. Search modifiers do not apply to all tables in the matrix: guidance is provided in the title of the table. Some of the tables are designed to increase the random nature of searching so may point you to another table. At the back of the book are the maps. They included large and smaller formats; on half pages to be stuck together and on a full page giving two print options. Because this is a digital product these pages can be printed individually.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Situation&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You have discovered a large building which appears to be a science centre or laboratory. There could be useful loot inside, but you can see from the outside that there has already been some looting and it looks like there may even be people living within the structure. However, there could potentially be medical supplies and handy equipment for the bunker.&amp;#10;You may now select the Science Laboratory when out on mission!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
