						               													<description>This game is an asymmetric hunt between the Beast and the Investigators.&amp;#10;One player plays as the Beast, the rest are investigators.&amp;#10;The Beast wins by eating 25 victims before the end of the game, the investigators win by uncovering the Beast's identity or by preventing it to kill 25 times.&amp;#10;A game plays over 3 years with 4 seasons each (3 rounds of 4 turns):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Events drawn during spring and summer help the investigators a bit. Those drawn during fall and winter are more advantageous for the Beast.&amp;#10;    The Beast secretly chooses where to strike next and can use special powers (but risks being cut off that power for the rest of the game and can even risk having its identity revealed and loosing the game).&amp;#10;    The investigators choose where they move (their presence usually protects their location from the Beast)&amp;#10;    The Beast reveals its location and the number of victims depends on the distance traveled, the NPCs present on site, if a special power was applied and if any investigator is there or not.&amp;#10;    Investigators present in a location visited by the Beast during the past 3 seasons can check if they can cut the Beast off one of its power or if the Beast risked its secret identity to activate one of these powers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;---&amp;#10;The Beast of G&amp;eacute;vaudan is the historic name associated with a man-eating animal or animals that terrorised the former province of G&amp;eacute;vaudan (consisting of the modern-day department of Loz&amp;egrave;re and part of Haute-Loire as well as the Auvergne and south Dordogne areas of France), in the Margeride Mountains of south-central France between 1764 and 1767. The attacks, which covered an area spanning 90 by 80 kilometres (56 by 50 mi), were said to have been committed by one or more beasts with formidable teeth and immense tails, according to contemporary eyewitnesses. Most descriptions from the period identify the beast as a striped hyena, wolf, dog, or wolf-dog hybrid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victims were often killed by having their throats torn out. The Kingdom of France used a considerable amount of money and manpower to hunt the animals responsible, including the resources of several nobles, soldiers, royal huntsmen, and civilians. The number of victims differs according to the source. A 1987 study estimated there had been 610 attacks, resulting in 500 deaths and 49 injuries; 98 of the victims killed were partly eaten. Other sources claim the animal or animals killed between 60 and 100 adults and children and injured more than 30. The beast was reported killed several times before the attacks finally stopped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
