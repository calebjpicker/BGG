						               													<description>Forty Nine Football (49F) is a strategy simulation football game that is designed to play out like a real game. Skill players and teams will perform according to their statistical abilities. Each team has its own Team Chart which includes individual ratings for all skill players. Defense and the Offensive Line are based on team effort, but are affected by injuries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A big factor in the game is Influence. Teams are rated for run and pass Influence, which is affected throughout the game. A team gaining Influence (and both teams can on a play), increases their chance of affecting the play. There is a quick bout of suspense / anticipation as every play quickly develops to the final result.&amp;#10; The game plays using a combination of Dice, Game Action Cards, and Results Cards (random numbers are on the Results Cards for those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to use dice). There are no separate charts for looking up results, it's all right there on either the Team Charts or the Cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You choose if you want to coach either or both Offenses and or Defenses or let the Solitaire Charts call all the Plays, or you can use the Quick Play Rules where you only have to worry about the Offenses, or you can also let the Solitaire Charts make the decisions. A standard game takes approximately two hours to play, while the quick play option reduces time by forty minutes. The quick play rules use the same charts as the standard game making it easy to move between the two in case of a blowout.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A spreadsheet (Excel or Numbers) is included so you can create and print your own Team Chart. This allows you to recreate past season, or play along with any current season.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As in any real football game, weather plays a role. Quick reference cards are used for wind, rain, snow, or combinations of each.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
