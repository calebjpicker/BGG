						               													<description>Postani partizan (Join the Partisans) is a WW2 board game with historical background, where players join Slovenian partisans in liberating their country. Fighting against the Axis, players use dice to win in battles, answer quiz questions about WW2 and preform various tasks including singing, drawing or even bringing food for the comrades at the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with a set:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     one partisan figure&amp;#10;     one white guard tower&amp;#10;     one colored guard tower (red, orange, blue, green) &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start the game by putting their partisan figures on a game board which represents Slovenia occupied by Axis. They choose from 130 towns and places. After they done so, they have to put white guard tower anywhere on the map. When white guard towers are set, players draft their first mission card from general headquarters beginning in 1941. The card tells them where to put their colored guard tower and what is the mission.  Players have to go through 5 years of war (1941-1945). There are 5 stacks of cards - one per year (250 missions).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now the game begins. Players throw special dice (D3) and move towards their objective. Other players guard towers represent obstacles and can not be attacked. When a player reaches his objective from General Headquarters card, he must fulfil his/her mission. The player takes 5 battle dice. He has 3 throws to hit the best combination (scale goes from: one pair, two pairs, three of a kind,..., five of the same). After throwing his combination, the player on his right takes a role of &amp;quot;enemy&amp;quot; and tries to throw a combination with bigger value. If player fails in achieving his mission, he must wait for another turn and try again. If he wins, he receive a card from Partisan school.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Partisan School has quiz questions about WW2. These cards bring points. After fulfilling his orders from General Headquarters players, move their white guard tower. After a successful attack (again with battle dice), a player receives a &amp;quot;Special Mission&amp;quot; card. These also bring points. Now, after both guard towers are eliminated, the player is ready to step into the next year. He again places his white guard tower on the map, and than drafts the card from year 1942 which tells him where to put his colored guard tower and what his the mission in 1942.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who gathers most points from Partisan School and Special Missions is the winner.&amp;#10;And yes.. you can get a medal!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
