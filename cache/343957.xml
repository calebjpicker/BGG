						               													<description>The object of Sirocco is to move the 6 pawns to the diagonally opposite field which is marked by a bar in your own color. On the way, you must try to take as many pawns from your opponents as you can. Since captured pawns from opponents have more value than your own pawns which have been brought into the opposite goal, the pursuit of the opponent is the hallmark of sirocco.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player receives 6 pawns in one color, which he places on the starting space of the same color. &amp;#10;One throws in turn (clockwise) and advances one of his pawns the number of points thrown.&amp;#10;One's own pawns and those of opposing players may be jumped over. The grey dots form the neutral starting space. pawns of the opponent may not be knocked over in this space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Important: You must first move all 6 pawns from the grey neutral space into the green playing field (= onto the green lines) before you can make a move or capture with a pawn that is already in the green space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all pawns have been moved into play (i.e., no pawn may be on the starting spot, base, or on the gray dots), one may move into the playing field. On the playing fields, players move from point to point, provided they are connected by lines. It is not possible to move an opponent's pawn on red-bordered spots, because these spots are protected. One may move one's own pawn back, but one may not return to one's own neutral square.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when a player has lost all his pawns or has moved them into the base (= the large colored circle). Each player then counts the points he has scored. &amp;#10;The following points are scored: - captured pawn of an opponent &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Captured pawn of an opponent: 3 points.&amp;#10;     own pawn in the opposite corner: 2 points&amp;#10;     A pawn of your own that is already in the neutral opposite field but not yet in the base: 1 point&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pawns which are still in the playing field at the end of the game have no value. The player who scores the most points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
