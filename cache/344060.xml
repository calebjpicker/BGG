						               													<description>Relax. It's just a board game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This will go down as one of the strangest years in the country's history. And you get a chance to enjoy it again.&amp;#10;It's all here. The boat parades. The Pandemic. The Cancel Culture. The Riots. Left-wing Globalists. The Laptop!!&amp;#10;Such Fun!!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And let's not forget the cheating. Mail-in ballot cheating. Poll watcher cheating. Dead guys voting in droves!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can the Incumbent president navigate public opinion, the Main-Stream-Media and win the swing votes he needs? Can he get them back after they've been stolen?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Swing State Steal is a premium quality product and the perfect consolation gift for the disheartened Republican.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Summary:&amp;#10;One player is the incumbent president, the other players represent swing states controlled by the opposite party.  The president is playing against all other players in the quest to collect votes.  Each state collects votes in their own color and the president is collecting votes in each of the opponent's colors.  At the end of the game, the president compares his collected votes with each of the states and whoever has more wins that state.  President needs to win a majority of the states to win the election.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is organized in four rounds:  The Campaign Round represents the time from the beginning of the year until election day, the Election day round, After the Polls Close and finally the Challenge Round.  First round is two laps, all other rounds are one lap.  Players roll a die to advance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First three rounds are about collecting and stealing votes from the incumbent.  Any player can land on a Fake News space that has a story from the headlines (maybe) and an opportunity to take or give votes away.  Swing states can land on a Cheat space where they draw a cheat card.   The president can land on an Evidence space where he collects evidence cards for the final round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;States use Cheat cards to steal votes.  They are color coded and organized by rounds.  Green cheats (Campaign) are mail-in cheats, Blue (Election Day) are polling place cheats and Purple (After Polls Close) are big-time cheats.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The final round represents the weeks between Nov 3 and Jan 6 and is a card games.  The president presents evidence cards he has collected and the State have to play cheat cards they've played that match and return some votes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On Jan 6th, the end of the game, is when all of the votes are tallied and a winner declared.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
