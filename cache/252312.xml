						               													<description>Free game published in the February 2018 (GTM #216) issue of Game Trade Magazine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game utilizes the Pairs game system and is designed with the Professor Elemental Deck, though it can be played with any Pairs deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Background: &amp;#10;You and your friends are attending a &amp;#10;series of parties, where you want to be seen with the &amp;#10;fanciest people. &amp;ldquo;Fancy&amp;rdquo; was designed with the Professor &amp;#10;Elemental Pairs Deck, but is compatible with them all.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment:&amp;#10; A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Summary: &amp;#10;The game is played in several rounds. &amp;#10;Each is composed of eight tricks, or &amp;ldquo;parties.&amp;rdquo; The &amp;#10;role of dealer passes to the left after each round. &amp;#10;A full game is one round for each dealer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Round: &amp;#10;Shuffle and deal a hand of eight cards &amp;#10;to each player. Players look at their hands, and then &amp;#10;pass two cards&amp;#10; to the player on their left. The player &amp;#10;on the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left will lead the first trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Trick: &amp;#10;Each trick is a party. To score points, &amp;#10;you can try to be the fanciest person, or to be seen &amp;#10;with someone much fancier than yourself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Starting with the leader and proceeding to the left, &amp;#10;each player plays one card face up. The card you play &amp;#10;represents a party guest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Important Rule: &amp;#10;A guest can&amp;rsquo;t appear twice at the same party. You may play a duplicate of a card that was already played, but it will be discarded, scoring no points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring the Trick: &amp;#10;After each player has played (or discarded) a card, the trick is scored as follows:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Center of Attention:&amp;#10; The lowest card played is the most fabulous in the room. This card scores its face value for the player who played &amp;#10;it. This player will also lead the next trick.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Hangers-On: &amp;#10;All other cards score points equal to the difference between themselves and &amp;#10;the next-lowest card. For example, if the cards are 3-4-6-10, they score 3, 1, 2, and 4 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Discards: &amp;#10;Copies of earlier cards are discarded. These score zero points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After scoring, discard all the cards from this trick and play another, starting with the player who just played the lowest card. A full round is eight tricks, and a full game is one round for each player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game End:&amp;#10;The game ends after each player has dealt one round.  Then, the player with the most points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
