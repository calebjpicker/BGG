						               													<description>User Summary:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bid Euchre is a variation of Euchre. Bid Euchre uses Jacks to Aces from two decks (two of each card). All cards are dealt to the players, who are on two teams of two.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Due to there being two of each card, the first card played is the high card (if the Ace of Spades is played first, it would beat the other Ace of Spades if it was played during the same round).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unlike Euchre, where there is a turned-up card that dictates what is trump (trump being a suit that beats all other suits, with the Jack of the suit being the highest, the other like-coloured Jack being second highest, then Ace, King, Queen, 10 and 9), each player bids how many tricks he/she thinks they can take and the what they want as trump. Valid bids are suits and no trump. No trump means that there is no trump suit and Aces are the high card for each suit. Each player bids once, with the person to the left of the dealer starting and the dealer ending the bidding round. Whoever has the highest bid starts the first hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play starts with the starting player playing one card face up. Following players must follow suit if they can, otherwise, they can play any card they want. High card takes the trick and dictates who starts the next hand. Play continues until all cards have been played (each player will have 8 cards).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each team counts the number of tricks they took during the round. The team that won the bid must have at least the number of tricks they bid to score. Otherwise, they lose the number of points bid (if they bid 4 and only took 3 tricks, they lose 4 points). It is possible to have a score in the negatives. The non-bidding team scores a point for each trick they took.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Teams can bid lone hands, requiring them to take all 8 tricks. If they do, they can score extra points. If they don't they will lose those points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After each player has dealt twice, the game is over. The team with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
