						               													<description>Dueling tile game that's a cross between dominoes, consequences and certain pocket monster type franchises.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Build monsters from your hand of tiles and send them to destroy your opponent, crushing anything that is in the way. The first set contains three decks - bugs, bots and beasts that can normally only combine with themselves unless a &amp;quot;combine&amp;quot; card is used to cross the gene pools. Original Artwork from Tang Mu though templates are provided to go make your own sets and fight! Files are available for Print 'n' Play or laser cutting your own set.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With a starting hand of 7 tiles, players have 3 actions per turn, picking up, playing or attacking (can repeat the same action more than once to get to three) A monster can only be started with a head section and can only attack when it is completed with a tail. As many body tiles can be played in between these two providing that the symbols on the sides match (combine tiles come into play here). Each tile adds different features to the monster - a red dot/explosion means another d6 is added to the attack pool and a shield with a number in it is a hit point that can only be destroyed by an attack die with a number equal or higher than it. If all the hit points on a tile are destroyed then that tile is taken off the monster and put back into the bag. Players also have three hit points of their own health and are removed from the game when they are destroyed (they can choose which monster defends the attack or can take the damage themselves to keep their precious creations safe)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For extra silliness, when attacking the player has to shout the entire name of their monster (each tile has a portion on the side of it) leading to absurd and often hilarious monsters weighing into battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Greebles is published with a Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial share alike licence as the creator is a great fan of collaboration. It was partly inspired by the drawing game consequences (or exquisite corpses if you went to art school :p) where a piece of paper is folded multiple times with a segment on a body drawn on each and then folded before passing to the next person so the final monster is only revealed when the paper is unfurled. There are blank templates available for the creation of your own sets and the author is planning on releasing official expansion packs as a way of showcasing other illustrators and ideas. A card game variant is also in the works.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
