						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;Oh dear, I shall be late!&amp;quot; sighed the White Rabbit. Well, in Wonderland, everyone is in a hurry. You, too, will want to travel through this amazing world as swiftly as possible, scoring tasty cookies along the way. Your journey will be enhanced by variety of magical special fields worth using wisely!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As you take on the role of one of the characters from Alice in Wonderland, your objective is to collect as many cookies as possible by racing through the board. During your turn, you can play either left or right of the three cards in your hand to move. The middle card will be available for your next turn, so you can plan your moves in advance. But be wary, as you may land on a special field like the Rabbit hole, from which you can only escape by spinning the arrow to determine your exit. Keep your wits about you, push your luck a little, and enjoy the adventure of exploring Wonderland!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
