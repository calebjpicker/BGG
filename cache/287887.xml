						               													<description>Before 1860, the West was simply known as the West, but then the Wild family arrived and changed EVERYTHING. Their impact was immediate and far-reaching. The West was no longer the West, it was the WILD WEST!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, the year is 1885. The Wild family has made a fortune through various &amp;ldquo;marketing&amp;rdquo; strategies, &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; ventures, and &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; projects. More importantly, the Wild family has emblazoned their name on both a territory and an era. After decades of pure wildness, the Wilds are tuckered out and ready for retirement. The family has grown tired of being ridiculously, filthy, stinking rich and they&amp;rsquo;ve done everything there is to do in the West.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a raucous family council, the Wilds have decided to give away half of their fortune and head east to retire as New York City slickers. The family wants someone with basic mathematical skills who is also able to wisely manage money without going into debt. Most importantly, though, the Wilds want someone to carry on their Wild legacy in the West; a person with rambunctious spunkiness and tons of true grit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The family has designed a simple competition to determine who will win the Wild Family Fortune and the glorious title of WILD ONE. Challengers have come from near and far to participate in this unprecedented event. As a challenger, your task is to manage basic income and expenses and stay as close to &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; as possible without going broke or into debt. Of course, there are other challengers attempting to do the exact same thing. Besides being known for their immense wealth, the Wild family also has a reputation for being very &amp;ldquo;hands-on.&amp;rdquo; During the contest, they will get down and dirty to help their favorite challenger win. Will you emerge victorious and be named the Wild One?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
