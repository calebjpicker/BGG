						               													<description>Wan Wan Touch is a dexterity soccer game from Nigeria. The game is a version of a popular street soccer game where players can only touch/play the ball once. The game can be played by 2-4 players and takes between 30-60 minutes to play. The game is suitable for anyone from the age of 7 years and above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How to Play:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any player who has last seen a soccer game begins the game by attacking any player; except when the game is in play. To begin any rounds, players must make sure the ball is on the Service Spot in front of their own post to attack. Then turn goes clockwise&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the boardgame, each of the up to 4 players defends their own cardboard goal as well as try to score other player. On a turn, a player flips the ball token forward by pressing a stick onto it (player MUST only touch/play the ball once at their turn)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Defending:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To defend, players place their playing stick in front of their own post to stop other players shot from entering the post. However, this can only be done when the ball is in their own &amp;lsquo;Threat zone&amp;rsquo; (This is marked by a box). If the ball is not in the threat zone, players cannot block their post.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beginning a round:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.    Once the game has begun, when a ball goes out of play/pitch, the player whose side it is that the ball went out of the pitch begins the round. &amp;#10;2.    Any player who is scored begins the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players score by shooting the ball into any player&amp;rsquo;s goal post.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Counting Scores:&amp;#10;Each players has 5 score point to reach in other to win the game. When a player scores any other player, they move their token on Point 1. They continue to move their token as they score. They aim to score 5 points to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Point deduction/Conceding&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players loose a point if they are scored when their token are on the RED point mark (3,4,5). If they are on the WHITE point mark (1,2), they are not affected when they concede a goal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winner: &amp;#10;The first player to successfully reach the Point 5 mark wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
