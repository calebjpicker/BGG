						               													<description>Deception! Destruction! Dexcitement!&amp;#10;Damage your friendships like never before with Detonators!&amp;#10;In this poker-face game of pretending to be a role you aren&amp;rsquo;t you must carefully build your own winning hand with cards from the deck - but beware, because one of your friends has your Detonator, and if they clue in that you are their target your hopes of winning could be up in smoke!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two goals in Detonators - to assemble your winning hand, or to detonate your target. The game is played using cards of five colors - each color has its own ability and rarity in the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the start of the game each player is given in secret their role card and their detonator. On their role card is written their winning hand - each of the five roles has a unique winning hand. Each detonator is coded to one of the other players&amp;rsquo; role cards, but nobody knows who has which role. The deck is then shuffled and placed between all the players, and plays three cards onto the table face-up for everyone to see.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play is turn-based, and on a player&amp;rsquo;s turn they can do one of four things:&amp;#10;        &amp;#10;DRAW a card either from the face-up set of three or from the deck itself.&amp;#10;PLAY a card from their hand, activating its ability and putting it in a discard pile&amp;#10;LOCK a card face-up in front of them, registering it towards their winning hand, or swap one of their already face-up cards with one from their hand.&amp;#10;DETONATE their target by playing two of their target&amp;rsquo;s winning hand cards, and correctly call out the player with that role. That player loses the game, and gives the player who detonated them their new target.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends whenever a player has assembled their role&amp;rsquo;s winning hand in front of them, or whenever there is only one player left standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
