						               													<description>Ready to save the world? Of course you are. You're a wizard, after all. With a good heart. A hero, some would say. Alas, there are bad wizards, too. Dark wizards. Wizards with ideas as to how society should function that are different than your own. The kind you'll need to Murder by Magic, in order to do all that saving of the world you fancy so proudly. However, they're trying to murder you, as well. Because, although you think they're the bad guys, they think you're the bad guy. Only one of you is right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How To Play:&amp;#10;Each wizard is given a number of cards from the white deck depending on the player count (7/6/5 for player counts 2/3/4) which are then placed face up in a line for all to see. These are each players' total health points. The player with the lowest total amount of health takes the first turn. For each turn, each player must make 3 moves. A move consists of either drawing one card from the black deck or playing one card from their hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Spell cards are played on top of any opponents health cards in order to deplete said opponent's health. When the value of the combination of attack spells meets or exceeds the value of health points listed on the card the opponent must place your attack cards on the discard pile and flip over their attacked health point card to show it has been depleted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When played, each attack spell card counts as one move. The only exception is if you have 2 or more of the same type of spell. They can be played together and it will count as one move. Other cards may help you to heal, add additional health or provide an extra turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player's total health is completely depleted, they are dead and out of the game. Be the last wizard standing at the end and you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
