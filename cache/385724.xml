						               													<description>Let me tell you a story! &amp;quot;There was a small town on the coast whose inhabitants were fishermen. One day they found a litter of newborn kittens on an abandoned ship and decided to adopt them. To feed them, they gave them the fish left over from their catch. In time, the cats became expert mice hunters, helping to keep the city's warehouses free of pests. The fishermen lovingly cared for them, entertaining them with balls made from the strings of their nets. The relationship became so close that it became a tradition to &amp;quot;adopt&amp;quot; each new litter of kittens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Can you attract the most cats to your feeder?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yummy Kitty is a 15-minute game for 2 to 5 players in which each player has to lure the other players' cats with succulent food, and what better than fish. But be careful! Once in your feeder, the cats may be tempted by the mice roaming around. Let them play with balls so they don't go after something more eye-catching and juicy like mice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
