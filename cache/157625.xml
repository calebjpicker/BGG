						               													<description>From the box:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Huzzah! simulates American Civil War combat at the battalion level. The system features encounters little known yet strategically fraught. These are fights that, had they concluded differently, might well have transformed a campaign, a reputation, or both. So, while the battles in Huzzah! were little more than a scrimmage when compared to, say, Gettysburg or Stones River, they were not insignificant, bearing weight well beyond what mere numbers suggest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is the first installment of what will become a series of games using the Huzzah! system. The next installment in the series will be Wilderness, in quadri-game form but which will come together in one big campaign game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scale: Combat units are Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery. Each Infantry and Cavalry unit represents 3 or more companies of a given regiment. Each Artillery unit represents an Artillery Section of 1 or two guns. Leader units represent individual commanders. Each hex equals about 150-200 yards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stephenson's Depot was a prelude to the battle of Gettysburg. Richard Ewell enjoyed his finest day of the campaign when he smashed the isolated outpost of Robert Milroy at Winchester. This is a rock-em sock-em affair, with the Yankees throwing the first punch. The blue player must land his blows quick and hard, driving the Rebs off the railway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rosey and the Woodpecker, the battle of Iuka, was a meeting engagement of sorts; few units begin on map and both sides receive a steady stream of reinforcements. Grant, the Yankee commander had divided his army into wings, each to simultaneously converge upon the rebels at the small railhead of Iuka.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Old Burn at Newbern, the battle of Newbern, North Carolina. A promising young star of the Union, Ambrose Burnside (Old Burn to his equals) runs up against a scratch force of Confederate militia, artillery, and cavalry.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Smash 'Em Up! the battle of Belmont Missouri, was U.S. Grant's first significant encounter with the Confederate Army. He initially drove the Rebels across the Mississippi River capturing both their headquarters and Belmont, a minor ferry point to Kentucky.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components:&amp;#10;4 17x22 Full Color Maps&amp;#10;560 Half-Inch Counters&amp;#10;1 Rules Book&amp;#10;2 Sheets of Charts &amp;amp; Tables&amp;#10;Dice&amp;#10;Game Box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
