						               													<description>A deck of cards that adds missions to Risk 2210 (similar in some ways to the way the Mission Deck does in regular Risk).  Cards are color coded (in red, amber, and green) for difficulty and the deck can be altered accordingly.  Included are rules for various ways of incorporating the 20 card deck into the base game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here at last we have something that has been sorely lacking from the new game since its initial release. One of the main difficulties that has arisen in the game is the fact that a single game can go on for a very long time, and even with the introduction of the 5 turn limit a single game can still go on for a number of hours. With this brand new pack of twenty mission cards players are once again put back in charge of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Difficulty Gradings:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Each mission card has been given a difficulty grade as is highlighted in the top right hand corner on the flip side of each card. The cards are graded green - easy, amber - moderate and red - difficult. What this grading means is that players have more control over the length of time that they&amp;rsquo;ll likely spend playing each game. For example, removing all of the red graded (difficult) mission cards, players can hopefully limit the length of game play. On the other hand, by removing the green graded (easy) mission cards this could theoretically greatly extend the length of play. With the time constraints, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to choose which cards to keep and which to leave.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     When should the mission cards be chosen? Depending upon the mission itself some could offer an unfair advantage if they were chosen prior to all initial reinforcements (those placed before bidding for turn order) having been placed on the board. To therefore avoid this, the mission cards should be chosen at random after all initial reinforcements have been placed, but before the first turn order bidding process has taken place. One thing to bare in mind prior to mission selection is to remove any irrelevant destroy &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; cards if not playing with five players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Matter of Points:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Although there are no set rules as to how players should play with this set of missions cards, here are a few suggestions as to how they can be used to enhance game play. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;* Players can choose to work on the basis of a one mission win i.e. as soon as one mission is completed then the player completing that mission has won.&amp;#10;    * Alternatively, a game could be played on a points basis with each grade of mission being awarded points i.e red = 3, amber = 2 and green = 1, and each game having a pre-agreed points target. Once that target has been reached through the completion of missions then you have a winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are actively encouraged to play around with the mission rules as best fits their own situations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Expands:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Risk 2210 A.D.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
