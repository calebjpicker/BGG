						               													<description>This cooperative game is based on a classic austrian children's book &amp;quot;The grandma in the appletree&amp;quot; by Mira Lobe. In the book Andi is sad, because he doesn't have grandmother. He retreats to the appletree, where he imagines all kind of zany adventures with an equally imaginatory and zany gandmother. Later on he meets his new neighbor Mrs. Fink, an elderly woman without grandkids, so in the end, he has two &amp;quot;grandmothers&amp;quot;. In the game the players try to help Andi tell Mrs Fink about his adventures with his grandma and then tell his mother about how he helped Mrs. Fink.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played over 8 to 10 rounds, depending on playercount. Each player has a hand of three cards. In each round, the active player flips an apple token from the tree, revealing either grandma (green) or Mrs Fink (blue). Depending on the colour he tries to fulfil as many of the cards of that colour until a timer runs out. To fulfil a green card the player has to roll a certain combination with four coloured dice as fast as he can. To fulfil a blue card the player has to stack the dice in a certain way. Whenever the active player finishes a card in front of him, the next player in turnorder lays another one out in front of him and the active player continues.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the timer has run out the active player has to shut his eyes immediately. On each green card is a word, on each blue card a chore. So the active player either has to tell a story with the words on the green cards or recount the chores he did on the blue cards. He has to do both in order. Each card correctly remembered goes into a scoring pile. Once a mistake was made, the rest of the cards are put away, and the next player becomes active player. After the last turn all the saved cards are counted up, and the group can rate their score based on a scale. The goal is to save as many cards as possible for scoring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
