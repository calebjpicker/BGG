						               													<description>In 1998, could people remember the movie plots &amp;amp; top-billed actors from the 40's, 50's, and 60's?  That would have been but a tiny challenge when this game was published, because fewer than 10% of the cards in this game rely on a familiarity with the likes of: Rex Harrison, Humphrey Bogart, Charleton Heston, and Cary Grant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Action! leans HEAVILY into the popular movies of the 80's &amp;amp; 90's, so the question today is: can YOU remember the movie plots &amp;amp; top-billed actors from the 80's &amp;amp; 90's?  (Were you even alive then?!)  If so, you're going to love both showing off your movie knowledge and laughing at yourself when you get stumped over the things you should totally have known.  Each movie has 3 clues given which make the right answer increasingly more obvious BUT worth fewer points.  (This is where all of those hours of movie watching finally become &amp;quot;an investment&amp;quot;, rather than &amp;quot;a waste of time&amp;quot;.)  15 points wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The tagline for this game says: &amp;quot;It's a party in a box!&amp;quot;  Remember when movies came in boxes too?  If so, you need to take this party OUT of the box &amp;amp; have a great time with it...you may even want to rewatch a few classics after the &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; stops.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
