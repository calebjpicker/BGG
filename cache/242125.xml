						               													<description>What is Rabbit Trails? Rabbit Trails is card game for all ages (especially students!) involving play with word association.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How do you play it? Play starts with each player being dealt 7 cards. Then the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over. Each player takes turns laying a card this is easily associated with the card showing. For example: The card flipped at the start of the game is, &amp;quot;Rabbit&amp;quot;. Player 1 plays, &amp;quot;Carrot&amp;quot; (because rabbits eat carrots). Player 2 plays, &amp;quot;Chef&amp;quot; (because chefs can cook carrots). Player 3 plays, &amp;quot;Astronaut&amp;quot; (because both chef and astronaut are professions). And player 4 plays, &amp;quot;Grape&amp;quot;. Wait! Grape?? Grape clearly doesn't match with &amp;quot;Astronaut&amp;quot;. The other players hear out Player 4's reasoning and vote on whether or not to allow the card to stay in play. They vote for the card to be removed. Player 4 has to draw a new card as a penalty and play continues. The winner is the first person to get rid of all their cards. If a player cannot play (and does not want to try and fool the others by playing a less than perfect card), the player can draw and, if the card will work, play it right away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But that's not all! There are also action cards featuring various ways to foil the plans of the other players and get you closer to winning the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What are the benefits of Rabbit Trails? Benefit #1, Rabbit Trails is an awesome game. Seriously! I have been designing this game over the past couple of years and have been getting bogged down with requests to make this game available from friends, family, and even people who see us playing it while out around town. After refining the cards and getting the rules nailed down, this game is finally ready for prime time! But that isn't all... Benefit #2, is related to education. It's not often that fun and education go together, but Rabbit Trails bridges that gap. Because the aim of the game is to get players to find connections between words, it makes students use higher order thinking, like analysis and evaluation to be successful, which are at the top of Bloom's taxonomy.Benefit #3 [Bonus], Rabbit Trails is great to test your English language skills if you are currently learning English or use English as a second language. It makes English language learners think critically about words and their multiple meanings!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
