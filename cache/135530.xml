						               													<description>In May of 1863 the Confederacy was winning battles but losing the war. In the west Grant was moving on Vicksburg. In the east, the Army of Northern Virginia was holding off the Army of the Potomac, but Lee realized that this could not last forever. Something had to change, he would strike north and take the war to the enemy. After weeks of maneuver, a chance collision between the two armies would seal the fate of the Confederacy. Now is your chance to change history. Can you do better than Lee and crush the Union army as it arrives piecemeal? Or as Meade will you hold the heights and dash the last great hope of Confederate victory? The decisions are yours&amp;hellip; in Gettysburg 150!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gettysburg 150 is an expansion of the ideas contained in Hold the Line. Like Hold the Line, it uses command action points for units to move and attack. The CRT is simliar, although artillery is weaker at longer ranges due to the greater scale of the battle. However, the board is not modular and infantry units are stronger. Units are division level, with brigade level cavalry. Advanced features like column movement is covered simply with movement bonuses for not moving adjacent to enemy units. More importantly, the game has optional rules to increase realism, including early reinforcements, army demoralization due to heavy losses, and rules to encourage corps organization. The game has 4 scenarios covering days 1, 2, and 3, as well as the Confederate attack on Little Round Top on July 2. Scenarios are playable in 1 hour for the day battles, 20 to 30 minutes for the Little Round Top scenario. The complete 3 day battle is playable in 2.5 to 3 hours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A division level Gettysburg game in honor of the 150th anniversary of the battle.  This simple fast playing game comes with a mounted 25 x 22 map, two counter sheets, rules, and dice.  You can play the entire battle in 2 to 3 hours, with 4 shorter scenarios.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will maneuver the counters representing the Union and Confederate armies across a hex cover representation of the battlefield at Gettysburg.  Each turn players get a number of action points that will allow them to maneuver, fire combat, and close combat enemy forces.  You will always receive some action points, but will never be sure exactly how many recreating the uncertainty of command and control. Victory is obtained by driving the enemy from the field by capturing terrain objectives or eliminating enemy units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game uses the popular Hold the Line game system as its base.  Optional rules include a Chaos of War table, force march, and more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Includes a mounted game board, 2 counter sheets with large 7/8&amp;quot; counter sheets, dice, and rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
