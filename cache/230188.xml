						               													<description>A dice and record keeping game for 2-4+ players with a Civilization building theme.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Civilization has 14 stats: Cities, Infrastructure, Ideas, Victory, Points, Population, Stability, Territories, Food, Resources, Culture, Military, Gold, Zeal and Wonders. These stats can go up and sometimes down with each player keeping track of the development of his civilization on a record sheet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 13 common tracks, one of which (the Pre-History track) is used in the pre-game, the other 12 during the main game. Most tracks are 13 spaces long, including the start space, and circular in nature so that players can move their markers round them in a continuous loop. The 13 tracks are:&amp;#10;Pre-History Track (for pre-game only)&amp;#10;Knowledge Track&amp;#10;Military Track&amp;#10;Cultural Track&amp;#10;Agriculture Track&amp;#10;Industry Track&amp;#10;Building Track&amp;#10;Wonder Track&amp;#10;Religion Track&amp;#10;Government Track&amp;#10;Leader Track&amp;#10;Trade Track&amp;#10;Naval Track&amp;#10;There are also several charts which are referenced from various points on the tracks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start the game with 5 points in Population, Territory, Food, Stability, Zeal, Military, and Culture. They also receive additional starting stats through the pre-game phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the pre-game phase players place one pawn each on the start space of the Pre-History track which has 23 spaces (including the start).  Players take turns rolling the die and moving their pawns forward along the track. When a player lands on a space they get the indicated boosts to their stats. They also put a marker on the space. If a player lands on a space that already has a marker they move to any space of their choice. When every space on the Pre-History Track has been marked the pre-game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the main game turns are conducted over a series of 16 phases, with players taking turns within each phase.  During most phases each player will roll one die and move along the indicated track (i.e. during the leader phase, players move on the leader track). Players gets the stat bonuses as described in the space they land on. Certain phases allow players to increase population size in exchange for resources, trade with other players, or declare war on other players in an attempt to steal territory from them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when anyone reaches 20 or more territories. If a player ever goes to zero territory or population he automatically loses.  At the end of the game, the player with the most Victory Points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
