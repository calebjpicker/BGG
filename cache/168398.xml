						               													<description>Around the time of the Civil War and following, the American West was certainly a wild place.   Although it was sparsely populated, many of the inhabitants were desperate and dangerous.  The West had always been home to large groups of American natives, but now had been receiving various undesirables such as cattle rustlers, gamblers, vigilantes, and banditos.  For the most part, those coming West were hungry for gold and were willing to do just about anything to get it.  Many found it too tiresome trying to get rich panning and digging, and instead found it more convenient to steal or kill for it.  As a consequence, it became the common practice not only for nearly everyone to carry a firearm, but also for nearly everyone to use one.  Needless to say gangs, posses, and gunfights were common parts of every day life.  Anybody with a gun had an opportunity to make a name and gain infamy in the great American West.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is exactly this setting in which you find yourself in.  You have the option of choosing one of seven notorious gunfighters of the old American West:  Kid Rango, Chief War Wind, Pablo &amp;lsquo;The Pistol&amp;rsquo; Perez, Walter Winston, Raging Arrow, Luther &amp;lsquo;The Lawman&amp;rsquo; Hale, or Little Pancho.  Besides the 7 posse bosses, Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail also comes with an additional 42 gunfighters.  Each boss and gunfighter comes with their own mugshot and unique battle stats.  With your posse boss, recruit a gang from the various cities to ride out to face your rivals.  Dodge ruthless banditos, determined lawmen, and hostile natives to get to your next gig.  You can knock off the Bank of the Nation, rustle up some cattle, or take on the Union Pacific Railroad.  You can also track down the other gunslingers to collect the bounties on their heads.  The way you stack your posse, the strategy you employ, and knowing when to strike will always give you the edge.  Each boss comes with his own clutch skills that come in handy when the chips are down.  No matter how many times you play, the scenarios are endless and the game never looks the same twice.  The winner is the posse that bags the most gold, even if they end up in pine boxes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail, you get three  distinct games in the Gunslinger series.  You get everything you need to play Gunslinger Shootout (arena style combat), Gunslinger Showdown (mano y mano confrontation), and Gunslinger Roundup (recruit your posse, collect the bounties, and get the gold). Anybody can get lucky and be a hero!  It takes one shot in the right spot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
