						               													<description>Game about the epic of the conquest of the Poles during the years 1908 to 1912 with a system of pushing your luck and with historical explorers both in the North Pole and in the South Pole.&amp;#10;Each player will organize an expedition and launch it on an adventure, winning the one that achieves the best milestones (closest to the Poles).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Expeditions are organized by spending money that each Explorer (with a card that represents it) contributes, by means of sledges, animals, provisions and equipment.&amp;#10;     The development of each expedition combines chance with Weather and Terrain cards and the decision to push your luck... with Freezing, Hunger or Disorientation problems.&amp;#10;     Victory conditions depend on how far the Expeditions go (closest to the two Poles), which will give Victory points.&amp;#10;     It can be played alone or with two players and each one can take several Historical Explorers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
