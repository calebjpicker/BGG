						               													<description>ESCAPE ROOMS ARE ALL THE RAGE!!! But someone is taking the concept to the next terrifying level.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Abandoned and forgotten for over two decades, Camp Hackaway sits in the middle of a thick forest where foliage and undergrowth have nearly reclaimed the old campground. People from all over the world are being abducted and dropped off in the forest on the outskirts of Camp Hackaway, forced to become unwilling participants in the ultimate game of escape and survival. Each participant is given a flashlight three very simple rules: 1) Search the cabins of the campground, find the key to the old pickup truck. 2) Survive the random attacks crazed serial killer Hackin' Hank. 3) Escape in the old pickup truck and win the game. And it won't be as easy as Hackin' Hank constantly roams the campground, stalking the participants one by one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Body Count is a horror themed card/board game hybrid that utilizes tile-flipping mechanic to simulate the fog of war as the players roam the campground in the dead of night, unsure of their surroundings. The game board is made up of a 4x4 grid of 3.5 inch square tiles that begin face-down. As players move along the grid, they flip tiles to reveal their destination before moving to the next tile. If they discover a cabin, they may search it and possibly find items to help them fend of Hank if he attacks, but they may also find other, more horrifying objects such as severed heads and human remains that may trigger other events that can change the game and affect their chances of escaping alive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After each player's turn, a card is drawn from Hank's location deck to see where he pops up in the campground - if it's a location occupied by a player, Hank attacks. If a player enters a tile adjacent to a tile occupied by Hank, he gets the opportunity to stalk and attack them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board changes with every game so you'll never play the same game twice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Do you have what it takes to SEARCH, SURVIVE, and ESCAPE?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
