						               													<description>Esprit de Corps &amp;ndash; Power and Glory is designed to meet the challenge of bringing to life this exiting period of history in the form of fast-moving, exhilarating and true to life games of skill on the table-top, redolent with all the atmosphere, colour and heroism of the battlefields of the times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Users of Esprit de Corps and Esprit de Corps A House Divided will be familiar with the general format and content of this rule book and with the rule mechanisms employed. Indeed there is some overlap in the period covered with that covered by Esprit de Corps, and complete overlap with A House Divided which is specifically honed to bring out the historical nuances and characteristics of the American Civil War. That is deliberate and in the latter case unavoidable given the broader canvas which Power and Glory seeks to address. For battles in the Crimea or the Indian Mutiny, for example, you have the choice to use either Esprit de Corps or Power and Glory for your wargames, the outcome will be more or less the same. Later in our period casualty rates increased with the widespread introduction of efficient breech-loading firearms and artillery and more effective machine-guns, and there was a resulting tendency to employ a somewhat more dispersed deployment of troops in the line of battle, all of which are accurately taken into account in these rules. Of course the development of Power and Glory' has benefited enormously from the experience of the authors with the two previous publications in the Esprit de Corps series and with rule books in the parallel Warlord series covering warfare in earlier periods of history.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Command and control and rapid manoeuvre are at the heart of these rules, just as they are in others in the Esprit de Corps and Warlord series. Though the effect of firepower is awesome, you cannot merely rely on defensive tactics alone for success. So be bold, exploit your chain of command to best advantage, concentrate your troops where it matters most, be aggressive where you can but defend resolutely where you must, and make best use of ground at all times. You can have great fun with these rules and your games will be fast and furious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Authentic historical accuracy brings to life the character and atmosphere of combat in the wars of the second half of the 19th Century.&amp;#10;Fast action games at every level in all theatres of war.&amp;#10;Detailed and carefully calibrated troop classification accurately reproducing the characteristics of the units and&amp;#10;soldiers in each and every war world-wide.&amp;#10;Comprehensive coverage of combat formations and weaponry.&amp;#10;Figures based in standard multiples as elements - no need to re-base your troops.&amp;#10;Summary Starter Rules to get you into action fast.&amp;#10;Fully detailed and comprehensive explanation in the Main Rules.&amp;#10;Many worked examples of how the rules operate plus numerous explanatory diagrams.&amp;#10;Complete example battle account - 'Action at El Teb'.&amp;#10;Carefully crafted and entirely internally consistent for speedy action and exciting games.&amp;#10;Essentially simple D6 based rules systems common with others in the Esprit de Corps Series - play one play them all!&amp;#10;Alternate movement facilitates fast play.&amp;#10;Command &amp;amp; control - recreating the difficulties and frustrations of command on the battlefield with a fully functioning chain of command from the C-in-C to the unit CO.&amp;#10;Example army lists and guidelines on how to put together your miniature armies.&amp;#10;Bolt on, fully compatible additional rules in a separate Appendix taking you on into the early 20th Century.&amp;#10;Fast and easy access to all aspects of the rules - cross referenced and indexed throughout.&amp;#10;Playsheets included for hassle-free, rapid manoeuvre and swift combat resolution on the tabletop.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
