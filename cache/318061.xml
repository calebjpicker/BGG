						               													<description>Rhonin's Lore is a tabletop board game for one to four players that will take adventurers on a journey to fight against a dark force of creatures from lore.  Adventurers may choose to take on the monster lords claiming dominion over the different terrains of the region, defend the villages surrounding the kingdom's strongholds, or, for the bravest of mortals, or take on the might of the great Archons of legends. This game offers both cooperative and player vs. player game play experiences as well as mini scenarios to explore the map and adventurer backstories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Adventurer's have been asked to help save Renwood from impending doom by defeating the monster lords. Adventurers have 15 days until the full moon rises and must grow their strength by defeating the creatures flooding into the land and acquiring upgraded weapons and armour. As the full moon nears, more powerful creatures will begin surfacing and the prophets of the kingdom speak of the monster lords entering the fight at the start of the 12th day. If the monster lords still live at the end of the 15th day, the realm is lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game utilizes a hex-based map to identify different regions of Renwood. The map tiles may be rearranged to a players preference, but it is recommended to play the first game with the original map layout with later gameplay randomly placing the tiles within the region. Monsters will be summoned each night based on the summoning cards drawn by players. The summoning cards will identify the level monster (Minion, Legionnaire, Pendragon) that will be summoned based on the player's level and the space for which a monster will be summoned. The type of monster will be determined based on the terrain tile that occupies the space identified on the summoning card. Each player will draw one summoning card to begin each day of their adventure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first encounters recounted in Rhonin's Lore originate from the land of Renwood. Renwood is a beacon of hope and a stronghold for peace in a region known as home to many creatures of lore. A balance has existed in the land for centuries as those seeking peace have learned to be weary of the lands claimed by the monsters of their lore. Those who venture into the dark seldom return and the monsters that lie within would seldom venture out, at least until the shifting of the winds. A fog and a darkness swept in and with it, the unspoken boundaries of old have been broken and the villages and paths, once safe in the light of the southern sun, are covered in a dark cold mist. The creatures of lore and only seen in nightmares reveal themselves again in flesh as their sights are set once more upon those who drove them into darkness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
