						               													<description>1822CA is an 18xx game that covers Canada from coast to coast and reimplements the 1822 system. The board is 33 percent larger than 1822, has 30 private companies, and 30 minor companies. The game has 10 public companies including the Canadian Pacific Railway that starts on both the east and west sides of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of an alternating series of stock rounds and operating rounds. Initially, there is one operating round between each stock round, and then once the first 2-train is bought, two operating rounds between each stock round.  The final set of operating rounds has three rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In stock rounds, players act as investors, buying and selling shares in the various companies. The player with the most shares in each company is the company&amp;rsquo;s director and decides all actions that the company takes in the operating round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In operating rounds, players, as company directors, run the various companies that they control. They choose whether to build track, place station tokens, which trains to run on which routes, whether to pay or withhold dividends and whether to invest in more trains, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met:&amp;#10;Immediately, if the first stock round ends with nothing sold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the operating round in which a company&amp;rsquo;s stock market value reaches the game end value of the stock market.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the first operating round following a stock round in which a major company&amp;rsquo;s stock market value reaches the game end value of the stock market.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the first operating round following a stock round in which the bank runs out of money.  The game still ends at that point even if the bank later becomes solvent. The bank continues to pay demands due of it even when broken; players should record these, or each lend the bank some money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the bank runs out of money in an OR, complete the pair of ORs and then run one additional OR (for a total of 3 ORs in the final set). The game still ends at that point even if the bank later becomes solvent. The bank continues to pay demands due of it even when broken; players should record these, or each lend the bank some money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player&amp;rsquo;s total wealth is the value of their stock, at current prices, plus cash on hand. Concession certificates, if they are still open and held by players, count face value. Private  company certificates and company assets count for nothing. The richest player wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
