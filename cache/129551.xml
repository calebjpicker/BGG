						               													<description>Soccer simulation. The field is a grid of 6 x 5 boxes. Each player receives a pack of action cards. Either coach place the 11 pawn in the pitch.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The mechanism is simple: the player with possession of the ball takes three cards attack action and puts them into three boxes of your choice on the board, empty or occupied by pawns or their opponents. Two of the three cards played, however, are &amp;quot;cards bluff&amp;quot; and only serve to pull the wool over the eyes of the defender, who has two cards only line of defense to counter the effect of the cards of attack and must therefore try to guess where the attacker has the real paper and where the bluff. Place the cards, move the pieces closer to where they were put in the boxes of the tiles, the tiles are discovered and resolved effects. If the defender did not guess where the attacker has put the card real action, this explains its effects immediately. If you have guessed, it resolves the conflict according to a mechanism completely devoid of throwing dice (sic): the proceeds to count a series of penalties against both the defender the attacker (for example, for each opposing checker that is located on the trajectory of a passage the attacker receives a penalty). If you are under penalty wins the contrast. In case of a tie the defender wins. If the attacker loses the ball as time counter moves forward one minute.&amp;#10;The action cards allow it to attack steps, jumps, throws, crosses, headers and volleys.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The action cards allow defensive tackle and advances (ground ball or head).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Resolved shots: the attacker has a certain number of points distributed on a shot that has a football goal (drawn on a separate sheet) divided into six sections. The goalkeeper has 14 points that can be distributed parade of no more than five of the six sections. The choice is made for both in secret. If at least one section there are several points that shot points parade's goal. Otherwise, parade. In case of a tie, corner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Who wins at the end of the two times (the duration of which may be agreed between the players) have scored more goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
