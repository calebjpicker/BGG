						               													<description>IN THE TRENCHES (ITT) system designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Devil Dogs 2 Faith &amp;amp; Sacrifice is an expansion/battle pack for Tiny Battle's In the Trenches: Devil Dogs. It adds counters for both the US Marines and German's, including tanks and four scenarios covering battles between them in the last year of the war, each with its own map.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The list of the 4 scenarios - which each include 1 to 3 alternate scenarios:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. The Farm: &amp;quot;As the troops in field-gray uniforms emerged from the woods and began their assault across the field, prone Marines spread out across a small ridge made sight adjustments and windage estimations. The Marines of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, lying in the grass at Les Mares farm, readied their Model 1903 Springfield rifles and laid out five-round stripper clips of .30-06 ammunition beside them for easy access.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Advance on Vierzy: &amp;quot;On 17 July 1918, the Marines and other Allied units marched through rain and mud near Soissons. Early on the morning of 18 July the 5th Marine Regiment began a major offensive by sweeping the Germans from Translon and Verte Feuille Farms. The swift advance was halting only after the enemy managed to reinforce their defense line running south through Vierzy. After regrouping, the Marines were ordered to advance on Vierzy later that afternoon.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Carnage at Bouresches: &amp;quot;After the costly gains in Belleau Woods and near Lucy, Marine forces turned their attention to clearing the Germans from Bouresches. The depleted 5th Marines, having sustained heavy losses in an open ground assault near Lucy approached Bouresches from the woods to the West. The 6th Marines had been ordered to aid the attack on Bouresches from its position near Triangle Farm.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. Action at Blanc Mont: &amp;quot;The first week of October saw heavy fighting and left both Marines and other allied units stuck well forward of supporting forces. Nicknamed 'The Box' by Marines since they were forced to defend against counterattacks from all sides. On the 7th and 8th of October Marines, with support from other units pushed into St. Etienne to take out the fortified MG positions and escape 'The Box'.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
