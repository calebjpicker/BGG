Rivals and won the &amp;quot;psychological warfare&amp;quot;, it becomes &amp;quot;mastermind&amp;quot; who do you think true...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game description from user:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Film Fixer&amp;quot; is a 3-4 player card game based on the theme of producing movies in the film industry. Although this game was made in Japan, the company has made it bi-lingual (although a few of the translations are a little strage).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with a new talent card and 8 coins. The player uses coins to purchase (contract) &amp;quot;talent&amp;quot; and sends them to &amp;quot;movies&amp;quot; in order to earn more money and victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents:&amp;#10;4  - Newcomer Cards&amp;#10;36 - Money Cards (9/6 coins, 12/3 coins, 15/1 coins)&amp;#10;37 - Movie Cards (15/Talent cards, 11/QE Film cards, 11/CP Film cards)&amp;#10;1  - The End Card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn is conducted in 6 phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 - Investment&amp;#10;2 - Change&amp;#10;3 - Contracting&amp;#10;4 - Shooting&amp;#10;5 - Profit&amp;#10;6 - Replenishing&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The instructions provided are a little confusing at first, but I'll do my best to try and summarize them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The movie cards (talent and film cards) are shuffled, the END card is placed two from the bottom, and 5 cards are dealt into the play area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1 - In the investment phase non-acting players can invest money in what they think the acting player will do. Money cards each have one of three logos on them: Yukidama Agency Corp. (for all talent cards [YA]), Qvinta Essentia Entertainment Inc. [QP] and Cosaic Pictures Inc. [CP] (the two movie companies). The invested money is placed face down and players wait until phase 5 (where they see if the acting player has played any of the companies non-acting players have invested in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2 - In the change phase the acting player can choose to pay one coin to switch out one movie card with a new one. They can do this as many times as they'd like as long as they have the money to do so. They do not receive change from this transaction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3 - In the contracting phase the acting player can purchase &amp;quot;talent&amp;quot; which will be placed face up infront of them. Talent often have various abilities that will affect play. In this phase, players can receive change from this transaction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 - In the shooting phase the acting player sends talent (this includes their &amp;quot;new talent&amp;quot; card) to film cards (if any in the play area). They can send multiple talent to work on different films as long as those films are being produced by the same company (you can't send one talent to CP and one to QE in the same turn. Either one or the other). You can also send multiple talent to the same film (as co-stars). The acting player will collect money and the film card (film cards go into the victory point pile). If the sent talent card has a star mark on it, it is discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5 - In the profit phase the other players will collect their reward if they properly invested their money (for example: If player B decides to invest a &amp;quot;one coin&amp;quot; card with the CP logo on it and the acting player (player A) sends tallent to a CP film, then player B will be rewarded [they can either put the invested money into their VP pile or upgrade it to the next higher value coin card]). If the non-acting player invested in the wrong company, that invested money is discarded.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6 - In the replenish phase new movie cards are dealt into the play area until there are 5 cards again. It is now the next player's turn and it becomes the investment phase again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the END card is dealt, the game will finish after the &amp;quot;next&amp;quot; player's turn. Once finished, each player counts their Victory Points. Player with the most VP is the winner (if tie, the player who made the most movies wins).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
