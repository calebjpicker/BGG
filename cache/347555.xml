						               													<description>Fraywick, the last great human city, is constantly under threat by the dangerous wild monsters of the world. But when Fraywick would fall, the Moxian Guard stands tall against the menace. Using the charismatic power of Moxie, the Moxian Guard command their own monsters to fend off threats from beyond the gates. You have discovered your own Moxie, and set off on a journey to rally your own band of monsters together. Tryouts for the Moxian Guard begin in eight weeks, do you have what it takes to make the cut?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Moxie: A Journey of Monsters is played over a series of 8 rounds, culminating in a final tournament between the players. Each round has two phases, a scouting phase in which players search various decks of cards, called routes, for monsters to recruit to their team, and a battle phase where they will face off against another player, pitting their recruited monsters against one another for rewards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the scouting phase, there are no turns. Instead, players act simultaneously, scouting routes they've reached. Players begin with just a handful of moxie tokens, which they'll spend to scout these routes. Players can search each deck they've reached one time each round, choosing only a single card from it to join their team, and so must choose how best to spend their moxie tokens to cover the most ground. By committing many moxie tokens to a route, players draw more cards from that route, giving them more options to choose from, but at the cost of less moxie to search other routes with. Once each player has spent all of their moxie tokens for the round, the game proceeds to the battle phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the battle phase, players pair off against each other to pit their team against the others. Each player prepares their team for battle by determining the order they'll send their monsters out, attempting to position each monster where it will best counter their opponents. Once players have committed their order, the battle begins, with players sending their monsters out one at a time to do battle until they run out of strength. Monsters strength is determined by that monsters particular strength dice, by comparing monsters types to see if one or the other can score a critical hit, and by utilizing the various effects of each monster to further alter the outcome. Once only one player has any monsters remaining, they win the battle that round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After each battle phase, players are rewarded based on their performance. Players who win their battle progress along the route tracker, opening up a new route for them to scout going forward in future rounds. Players who lose their battle, on the other hand, are rewarded additional moxie tokens to allow them to scout further into the routes they've already reached. In addition, defeated players may advance one of their monsters into a powerful new form, granting it new strengths and abilities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play continues in this way until the end of the eighth round, where players will compete in a final tournament bracket to determine the games final victor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
