						               													<description>Kagoun is a game of confrontation and card development.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Paris in 1900, while the Universal Exhibition is in full swing, a few spiritism enthusiasts discover the existence of Kagouns. &amp;#10;These &amp;quot;fantastic&amp;quot; entities are geometric-shaped butterflies of light. From that moment on, these &amp;quot;Kagoun hunters&amp;quot;, become obsessed with capturing them and uncovering their &amp;quot;mystery.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;The players are these hunters who do everything they can to acquire as many Kagouns as possible, even if it means falling out with their friends. &amp;#10;They have even formed groups to hunt together and invoke them by &amp;quot;sublimating&amp;quot; them and using their &amp;quot;mystical glasses&amp;quot; to attract them. It's teamwork, but not entirely, as nothing prevents a K-hunter from stealing a Kagoun from their neighbor, turning them into adversaries in the end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn in a round, you can (1) capture cards (free-roaming Kagouns) or (2) discard cards from your hand (Kagoun targets). &amp;#10;You can also (3) pair up the cards you have captured or (3) steal a card from your neighbors or opponents. If you capture cards, &amp;#10;you can have up to 3 pairs of Kagouns in front of you. If you discard, you draw the same number of cards as you discarded. &amp;#10;If you assemble the cards next to each other, following their shapes, you start accumulating points.&amp;#10;To prevent your opponents from progressing faster than you, you must steal cards from them, but they will defend themselves each time without spending their turn's action. &amp;#10;All card placements are done face-down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some cards also grant you powers that boost your action on your turn in the round. &amp;#10;To win the game, you must reach 10 assembly points with the bonus point system based on repeating Kagoun symbols. &amp;#10;You must announce &amp;quot;Kagoun!&amp;quot; and if, at the end of the final round, you have the most points, you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
