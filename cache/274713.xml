						               													<description>Find your way to Together.....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Valentime's themed card game for 2 player. All player roles are non-gender specific.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Needed to play:&amp;#10;5 cards, 9 cubes and 1d6 inside a d6&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, both players are playing cooperatively. Your goal is to move your player markers from their starting spaces to the &amp;lsquo;Together&amp;rsquo; spaces, at the end of the game board, during your shared turn. If you cannot do this before the marker on the board&amp;rsquo;s time track reaches 0, or, if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup&amp;#10;Place the two halves of the game board so that the sides marked A face each other. Place the 2 player markers on their respective               starting spaces at the end of the board. Place each of the 4 Hobgoblins of Sadness markers on the 4 black squares. Place 1 on the board&amp;rsquo;s time track. Lastly, each player should choose one side of a personality card and place a marker, in their &amp;#10;matching color, on the [8] space of their energy track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players play:&amp;#10;One player rolls the die in a die. Each player then chooses one of die roll results to apply to either movement or energy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For each 6 rolled, move the marker on the time track down 1 number. Remember: if the marker on time track on reaches 0, you have both lost the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Movement is either left or right, forward or back, never diagonally (unless a special action allows this).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At any time during their shared turn, each player may use the special action listed on their card. Reduce the energy on your card&amp;rsquo;s track to pay for this, as specified by the special action. Your energy levels may never go above 8 or below 0. Remember: if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you have both lost the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players may move to a space occupied by a Hobgoblin. If, at any time, a player&amp;rsquo;s marker is on the same space as a Hobgoblin, they may spend 2 energy to send the Hobgoblin back to a starting space of their choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hobgoblins of Sadness play:&amp;#10;All Hobgoblins of Sadness now move 2 spaces - left, right, forward or back, never diagonally. Players will always move the Hobgoblins towards the player marker nearest to a Hobgoblin&amp;rsquo;s position. If both player markers are equally distant, move the Hobgoblin to the player with the most energy. If still tied, move them towards the player of your choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a Hobgoblin moves to a player&amp;rsquo;s space they will reduce that player&amp;rsquo;s energy by 1 or 2.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next Turns and Game End: &amp;#10;Players now move or gain energy on their shared turn, followed by the Hobgoblins movement. If both players enter their final &amp;lsquo;Together&amp;rsquo; spaces at the same time, during their shared turn, they win the game and have found their way to Together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you cannot do this before the marker on the board&amp;rsquo;s time track reaches 0, or, if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A new game in the &amp;quot;Gameshop&amp;quot; series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
