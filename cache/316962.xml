						               													<description>Panzerkrieg, Designer Signature Edition marks the return of a true wargaming classic by John Prados, faithfully remastered and updated with this all-new, supersized edition. John Prados introduces some discrete but friendly changes to the system to improve his classic design covering operational warfare in Southern Russia during WWII.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Panzerkrieg is an operational level simulation of the various Axis and Soviet campaigns in southern Russia during the period 1941-1944. &amp;#10;The game is played on a map depicting southern Russia from its western border with Rumania and Poland in the west to the Caucasus mountains in the east. &amp;#10;These operations, more than any others, display the large forces and vast distances that characterized the protracted warfare between the industrial giants Germany and the Soviet Union. The simulation presents ten scenarios (including one learning scenario), each modeling a different period of the war. Each scenario is played as a separate game and all scenarios use the same rules and components.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is an examination of the battles which shaped the campaign and is based upon evaluation of the combat forces, the leaders, the logistical limitations, and the terrain over which the antagonists struggled. &amp;#10;Panzerkrieg has been designed primarily as a two-player game, with one player commanding the Axis forces and the other the Soviets. It is well-suited for solitaire play, however. When played solitaire the competitive value of the game will be missed, but its value as an historical tool will be undiminished.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some of the game rules include armor superiority, breakthrough and exploitation, leaders, supply, fortifications, bridgeheads, special units, combat reserves, rail and naval movement, air power, and Axis satellites. The game consists of ten separate scenarios, each depicting an important operation, along with the learning scenario.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rather than being a simple retread with nicer components, this new edition incorporates additional markers and introduces limited intelligence and fog of war, suitable for two players, along with other changes and enhancements to the system that are fully detailed in the Designer's Notes. Enhancements have been made pertaining to the combat system, air bombardment, effects of leaders, changes to &amp;quot;stalemate&amp;quot; combat result, changes to anti-tank units to more properly reflect the tactical doctrine, altered Battlegroup/Replacement rules, changes to Exploitation Segment, and more. As fully noted by the designer, these are all key enhancements to improve the historicity and play experience of this classic design.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Product Information:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Complexity: 5 out of 10&amp;#10;     Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10&amp;#10;     Time Scale: one week per turn&amp;#10;     Map Scale: 14 miles per hex&amp;#10;     Unit Scale: divisions and corps&amp;#10;     Players: one to two, best with two&amp;#10;     Playing Time: 2-5 hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher's website&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
