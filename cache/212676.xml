						               													<description>This is the 6th in a series of Annual Games Unlimited Holiday Games and is the followup to Gameshop Express (2011), Gameshop Workday (2012), Gameshop Gladiators (2013), Gameshop Adventurers (2014), and Gameshop Expansions (2015)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To Win: Have the best gameboard collection by scoring the most &amp;#10;Victory Points (VP) based on your owned games and add-ons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup: Each player receives 1 Collection Tracks card, &amp;#10;1 $/Shelves/Add-ons card, and 10 markers. Place 1 marker on the &amp;#10;1 Shelving Unit Track space and 1 marker on the $3 space on the &amp;#10;$ Track. 4 of the remaining markers will be used to mark Add-ons purchased. The other 4 markers will be used to mark a player&amp;rsquo;s owned games on the Collections Tracks. The 2 dice are given to the player who was chosen to go first. The first player will be the one who has most recently been to their favorite local gameshop.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play: Each player&amp;rsquo;s turn consists of three phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 1 Upkeep: Pay the listed upkeep fee on each of your Shelving Units. For each Shelving Unit a player cannot pay the fee for they must move a marker back 2 spaces on a Collection Track of their choice. Players do not pay the Upkeep fee on their first turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 2 Dice: The player rolls the 2 dice and they may then reroll any die or dice an additional two times.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dice are then used as follows: &amp;#10;(Note: dice faces 1 (red) and 2 (yellow) do not count as Collection Track colors)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A. Move a marker, adding games to a colored Collection Track matching one die color rolled (3 (orange) 4 (green) 5 (blue) 6 (purple)). The amount moved will be equal to 1/2 the value of the other die, rounded up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;B. Move a marker one space on a Collection Track matching one die color (3 4 5 6), and add the other die&amp;rsquo;s value to your $ Track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;C. Add both die values to your $ Track. Your opponent then moves a marker on any one of your Collection Tracks back 1 space.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For each Shelving Unit a player owns, they may move past the        space (this space shows the first VP scoring amount on each track) on one Collection Track. They may not move past this space on an additional Collection Track until they own an additional Shelving Unit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Phase 3 Expand: The current player may now purchase 1 Add-on and/or 1 Shelving Unit if they have the money to do so. Pay the listed cost and move the marker down that amount on the $ Track. Place a marker in the space next to the purchased Add-on. The first player to purchase a listed Add-on receives a $1 discount off the purchase price. The dice are then passed to the other player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Add-ons: 1 Add-on may be purchased by a player each turn. &amp;#10;The first player to purchase a listed add-on receives a $1 discount off the purchase price. Score VP at game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game End: The game ends when 1 player purchases all 4 Add-ons or&amp;#10;when a player reaches the maximum VP space on one Collection Track. The player&amp;rsquo;s opponent may then take 1 final turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Score each Collection Track you own a Shelving Unit for. Each track shows a VP number in a circle next to certain spaces on that track. Score the highest VP value reached or passed on a Collection Track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Score additional VP for any purchased Add-ons the player has.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Highest VP score wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
