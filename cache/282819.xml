						               													<description>Kick On is a collectible card game in which players will face off taking on the role of soccer team trainers, organizing their teams, strategizing plays and formations and converting goals to become the best trainer in the championship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PREPARING THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player will be able to customize a deck of 45 gameplay cards (Play, Strategy, Foul and Energy cards) and 10 Player cards, in five categories of strength and rarity (Amateur, Semi-professional, Professional and Legendary, the latter admitted only once per deck) and use these strategically in combination with the rolling two six-sided dice to determine certain aspects of the different gameplay interaction&amp;rsquo;s outcomes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The customization of the deck takes place before playing, and different configurations can bring about setup bonuses (for instance, starting with more Energy Cards if one of your Players has the &amp;lsquo;Captain&amp;rsquo; ability).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAMEPLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The playing area is divided into a series of Zones: the play zones (Defense and Attack), the Lines of Formation, the Bench, the Exhausted Cards, and the Showers.&amp;#10;Player cards have certain stats and special abilities. There are different Lines of Formation on the pitch in which they can be situated (Goal, Defense, Middle-field, Attack) and begin play already on either the pitch&amp;rsquo;s play zones or the Bench (not the player&amp;rsquo;s hand). Cards engaged in the current action move into the Defense of the Attack Zones.&amp;#10;All Play, Strategy and Foul Cards have an Energy cost to be paid with the use of Energy Cards, which are then Exhausted until the following turn. All resolved Play, Strategy and Foul Cards, as well as expelled Player Cards, are all sent to the Showers. Players from the Bench can be brought into play through the &amp;ldquo;Exchange&amp;rdquo; Strategy Card or if a player&amp;rsquo;s Player is Injured by one of the other player&amp;rsquo;s Foul Cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay is carried out in turns and each turn consists of five phases: 1) Energy, 2) Tactical Advise, 3) Attack or 4) Defense and 5) Taking a Shot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During these phases the players may sequentially:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     either spend or regroup Energy or Player cards;&amp;#10;     use their Strategy Cards;&amp;#10;     select some Players and attack; or &amp;#10;     use Strategy and Foul Cards to defend; and&amp;#10;     Take a Shot for the goal, comparing Player defense and attack stats modified through dice roll to determine the success of the shot- if successful, they score a goal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Penalties can happen on Phase 4) by annulling a Foul card with the Strategy Card &amp;ldquo;Penalty&amp;rdquo; or as a tie-breaker at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as one of the player&amp;rsquo;s decks runs out the game is over and the player whose team converted the most goals is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
