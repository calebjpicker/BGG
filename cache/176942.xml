						               													<description>The legend of the 8-bit battle goes as follows. In a distant kingdom lived a King who ruled over a mighty nation. But alas, the kingdom was torn in two as factions began to form against the King. Now the king must draw upon his closest allies else he will battle against them for the future of the kingdom. They are: The King, The Warrior, The Wizard, The Queen, The Goblin and The Villagers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game creates several unique strategies. Do you choose items or characters that you can stack up to ensure victory, but at the risk of letting your opponent have automatic victory points because you cannot engage in every battle? Or will you go with special characters like the wizard who have a high probability of victory on their own? Or will you use special items to gain the advantage by increasing your attributes or peeking at the other players cards before you have to make a decision. The choice is yours, but choose wisely, because every decision you make will lead to victory or your untimely demise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 8 character cards are shuffled and placed between the two players, face down. Each player draws two cards, then decides which of the two to keep and which to put back. Shuffle and repeat until there are only two character cards left.  These two cards are randomly distributed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Repeat these steps for the item cards except stop once each player has three item cards.  Place the remaining item cards to the side as they will no longer be needed this round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Play&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who went first is now the attacker. They select one character card and one item card and place them face down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second player is now the defender. That player selects a character card face up and an item card face up. If a card allows additional cards to be played, it is played now.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The attacker then reveals their cards. If a card allows additional cards to be played, it is played now.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle: If the attacker's Attack value is higher than the defender's Defense value, the attacker wins. Else the defender wins. In the event of a tie, the defender wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winner takes all of the cards and puts them in their discard pile. Once a player is out of characters to play with, the other player places the rest of their cards into their discard pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players go through their discard pile and count up the Health Points (which are victory points). Player with the most points that round wins the round. Winner decides who goes first for the next round. Best of 3 rounds wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
