						               													<description>The game starts with players designing the Town by choosing from the 12 available districts, ranging from forest to the central business district. Changing the set up of the Town means that the game has more variability over time as districts advantage different candidates. Players are also assigned purple 'values' cards, which they share with the players next to them. This means you have things in common but, in a 4 player game, have nothing in common with the person sitting across from you! Values are important: your candidates perform better if they have the same values and your projects give you more legacy points if they also align with your values.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the Town is established and the districts chosen, players select cards (their candidates and inventory) and begin building up their arsenal for the upcoming elections. Be sure to select good candidates! They come with one or more Persuasive (P), Strategic (S) or Ruthless (R) skills which determines the number and type of actions they can make as candidates and later on as councillors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each district is up for election and players spend resources trying to ensure their candidate comes out as the winner. Players adopt the persona of their candidate and give a short 'campaign speech' to the table, outlining why they deserve your vote. The player with the &amp;quot;best speech&amp;quot; wins additional support which increases their odds of being elected. Support is also increased by the candidate's popularity in that district and any other cards you burn to give you a competitive edge. Be careful: the more you burn now, the less you can do once you're in Town Hall! Each candidate elected is worth legacy points, which decide the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning candidates become councillors who can complete project in their term of office if they have the necessary skills (P, S or R). Complete a project and get more legacy points. Diversity is key: players are rewarded bonus points for a complete PSR set of 3. At the end of 3 rounds the player with the highest number of legacy points is the winner! For experienced players, there is the option to include an add-on mode where the Mayor of the day tries to persuade players to support their proposal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
