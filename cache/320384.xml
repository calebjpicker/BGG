						               													<description>Rock Band Fights Evil is the next game project from Pocket Option Games. In this game, players control a rock band attempting to escape demons from Hell, or the demons tracking down the cheapskates trying to skip out on their deal with the devil. It is a diceless 2-player game played on a hex map, involving movement and strategic placement of playing pieces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rock Band Fights Evil is a simple diceless game, with no luck or chance elements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup - The Hell player places one demon in each hex that is not a corner (three hexes per map edge). The Rock Band player places the relic in the center of the map. He then places one member of the rock band in each hex adjacent to the relic, so that the band surrounds the relic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal - The Rock Band player's goal is to move the relic off any map edge. The Hell player's goal is to get past the rock band and destroy the relic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Turn Sequence - The Rock Band player chooses one token and moves that rocker any number of hexes in a straight line up to its Move trait. Under most circumstances, rockers cannot enter occupied hexes. After that rocker moves, he may attack. Each token has a unique method of attacking and defeating opponents, e.g. &amp;quot;kill each adjacent demon that has no Hell tokens next to it.&amp;quot; When that rocker's move and attack have been resolved, play proceeds to the Hell player. The Hell player's turn sequence is identical to the Rock Band player's.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Move: Different pieces have different Move values, so the humans have to stay on their toes. Some people are a little quicker than others. We all had that one kid in school who always ended up on our team, but never could pull his own weight. For most of my childhood, I was that kid. Also, demons tend to be a lot quicker than humans. Life's like that.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attack: After a unit moves, it can then Attack. This is a diceless act that depends entirely on the positioning of your unit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Win Condition: The rockers are trying to retrieve a relic that they intend to use to free themselves from their contract. I won't ruin the surprise; read the books! Anyway, if the rockers can move the relic off the map, they win! If the demons ever are able to maneuver into a position to destroy the relic, they win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
