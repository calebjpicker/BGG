						               													<description>In Sleep Tight you are kids stuck in a very special dream...a dream where the Sandman lives. Your souls have been shattered, and the only way to wake up is to collect Soul Fragments by traversing your nightmares. But watch out, because the Sandman will haunt you trying to consume your remaining Soul Fragments.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Team up against the Sandman or turn against each other. If the Sandman is killed, everyone wins. But if one of you wakes up first, they win, while the other players stay trapped in the nightmare forever, left as a feast for the Sandman.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Try this game of cooperation, conflict, betrayal, and nightmares&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HOW TO PLAY SLEEP TIGHT&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sleep Tight is a 10-20 minute game that is dynamic and fast-paced in terms of decisions and actions. Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;re lucky and get a large hand of cards you can choose from, and sometimes you have to micromanage and get the best out of a small hand. It&amp;rsquo;s a game where your luck can change suddenly when the Sandman lashes out, testing your intuition and skills. Will you hide and wait for the attack to blow over, or will you actively attack and escape by the skin of your teeth?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Sleep Tight you need to constantly be alert and think few steps ahead, as you will need to guess the other players&amp;rsquo; next move or even worse, the Sandman&amp;rsquo;s!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players uses action cards and Soul Fragments as a &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot; for their action. They choose to cooperate with other players or can even join the Sandman in his evil goals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Sandman has a stack of action cards that represents also his health pool. When the Sandman is out of action he is defeated. There are a lot of ways to inflict faster damages to him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two ways to win:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Kill the Sandman. If the Sandman deck is empty, all the players win. If you prefer to have one winner in this case, the winner is the player with most Soul Fragments. (The nightmare ends, and everyone wakes up.)&amp;#10;     Escape the nightmare. If a player has 10 Soul Fragments and plays the card, that player wins and the other players lose. (The dream collapses, leaving the other players to be consumed by the Sandman.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two ways to lose:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Everyone dies. If every player dies by reaching 0 Soul Fragments, the players lose. (They die and are completely consumed by the Sandman.)&amp;#10;     The nightmare traps you. If the Dreamscape deck is empty, the players lose. (The kids are trapped in their dreams and can&amp;rsquo;t wake up anymore)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
