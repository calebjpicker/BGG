						               													<description>Men (Egyptian: Mn) is a 5,000 year old game from ancient Egypt. It is roughly contemporaneous with Mehen and Senet. One of the most mysterious of ancient games, only two partial boards have been discovered by archaeologists, along with a detailed tomb painting depicting the board layout and playing pieces, and one sculpture depicting players playing it aboard a ship. Game scholar and designer Zach Horton recreated a speculative version of the game and it was released in two versions by Pandora Games: as a deluxe boxed Kickstarter set with Mehen and later as a standalone game. This modern reconstruction closely follows the ancient evidence and produces a unique game with a trading theme wherein players send ships out on trading missions and wager on when they will return, while manipulating them en route in an attempt to fulfill their own predictions and foils their opponents'.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game utilizes a unique three-dimensional board, enabling playing pieces to be placed both flat on spaces and upright in grooves. This aspect has been re-created in the modern version utilizing a handmade wooden board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn, each player chooses on their turn from a number of different options, from gaining sticks to throw to obtaining movement banks that can be accumulated for later sprints, to sending a new ship off on its journey. No player &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; any of the ships. Any player may move any combination of ships however they wish. Victory points are obtained by performing certain actions (setting sail, picking up goods, bringing goods home), as well as by correctly predicting how long a given ship will be at sea. Every time a ship sets sail, all players mark their prediction on a simple, but hidden, ledger. When a ship returns, predictions are checked against the actual results. Meanwhile, all players manipulate conditions on the board to try to make their own predictions come true!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Any number of ships can be sailed in a game, but only 5 can be on the board at any given time. Only 5 cargoes can be picked up and returned to port during the game.  Once all have been picked up, &amp;#10;ships can continue to sail, but do not pick up any cargo on the Foreign Port space (though they must  still pause there).&amp;#10;Once all 5 cargoes have been returned to Port, the game ends.  After scoring that ship, the player with the most Victory Points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
