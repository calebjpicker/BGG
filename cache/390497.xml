						               													<description>Cheezy Chase is a stop-or-go game for 2 to 5 mice ages 5 and up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dorothy the little mouse has a rumbling tummy. To stock up, she has to get out of her hole and explore the house in search of cheese. So she ventures out in search of delicious little golden cubes. But beware! The house is littered with mouse traps. And if that&amp;rsquo;s not enough, Kitty is on the prowl, ready to pounce on her and eat her up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, draw a card and place it face up in the play area. Repeat this action as many times as you like, until:&amp;#10;1- You get caught because you have at least 3 traps or 3 cats in the game area. Your turn end and you lose the cards you have revealed.&amp;#10;2- You stop before getting caught and you winn all the cards in the game area and place them in a pile in front of you.&amp;#10;3- You stop and win all the card in the game area if you find a 3 cheeses card!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when all cards have been drawn. Each player counts the cheeses on their cards that they have won.&amp;#10;The player with the most cheeses wins the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
