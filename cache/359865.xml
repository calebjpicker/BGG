						               													<description>Gears of Industry is a Personalized Card Game (PCG) for 2-4 players. All players build their personalized decks from the same fixed card pool of two Tech Decks (52-cards). Each player customizes their own 26-card play deck to create a unique play experience to reflect their personality and play-style. Players also bring a customized 15-card Market deck contribution. Players combine their personalized Market deck contributions into a single communal Market deck. The theme of the game is an economic factory engine building game during the modern post-industrial era&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players play card(s) into markets. When the active player has three cards in a market that player can trigger a market clash (poker hand competition). They compete against other players by making poker hands to score points. The winners of the market clash scores victory points based on the rank of the poker hand they formed. The first to get to 7 victory points wins the game. Ties are broken with the value of a player&amp;rsquo;s factory and market cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY &amp;ndash; Each player's personalized play deck will contain Technology cards (Gear cards) which represent factories. Factory cards allow other cards to be played into the two Markets. Horizontal (left or right-facing) Factory cards pay for playing Market cards. Upright and upside-down Factory cards can boost a market. Each market contains two neutral market cards. On their turn, the active player can use game effects on their Market cards or one of the neutral Market cards. The active player can trigger a Market Clash. During a Market Clash all the players compete in a Market by making the best poker hand they can using the player&amp;rsquo;s market cards, the two neutral market cards, and one factory card in the market boost orientation. The winners of the market clash scores victory points based on the rank of the poker hand they formed. Winning players score 1 victory point for a poker hand up to a three of a kind, or 2 points for higher ranked hands. Factory cards are rotated when Market cards are played and during the Market Clash step.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
