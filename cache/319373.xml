						               													<description>Throughout the game Rangers will build two areas: an Ecosystem consisting only of species in their BiOME, and a Sanctuary made up of any species in their hand. At the end of the game, points are awarded for different aspects of the Ecosystem and Sanctuary, and the winner is the Ranger with the most points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If using 1 Starter Pack between Rangers, each Ranger takes their 9 BiOME cards and the rest of the cards are shuffled. Deal the remaining cards evenly between the Rangers, up to a maximum of 9 each. Leave the rest aside. If each Ranger has their own pack of cards, they may select 9 BiOME and 9 non-BiOME cards for their hand (rather than randomly dealing). Each Ranger now places down an Eden card (the first card in your ecosystem) and 3 Sanctuary cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DURING THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Ranger whose turn it is is called the Active Ranger and has 3 choices: Endangerment, Sanctuary or Clash.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Endangerment, ALL Rangers place a species into their Ecosystem (called an Eco card). The Active Ranger then rolls the die to see which danger (e.g. Persecution) must be overcome. Rangers use their remaining Holding cards (i.e. those not already in Ecosystem/Sanctuary/Life Cycle) to overcome the danger. If a Ranger can&amp;rsquo;t overcome the danger, they lose the Eco card they just played, plus 1 of their Sanctuary cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Sanctuary, the Active Ranger only places a card into their Sanctuary. No more than 4 species are allowed in the Sanctuary at any one time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Clash, the Active Ranger nominates another Ranger, and both choose a species from their Holding cards. Both cards are placed face-down on the table, and revealed at the same time. Follow the Clash matrix to find the winner of the meeting between the two species. Both cards are placed into each Ranger&amp;rsquo;s respective Life cycle (the discard pile) and rewards/punishments enacted (see full Gameplay guide for Clash matrix and outcomes).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;END OF THE GAME&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a Ranger runs out of Holding cards or Sanctuary cards, the game enters Brumation. Each Ranger still in play then has 2 turns as Active Ranger each, before the game is finished. At this point, each Ranger counts their score from their Ecosystem and Sanctuary (see Gameplay guide for scoring system), and the winner is announced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The starter pack features 54 amazing species, including 9 cards from the Forest, Desert, River and Scrub BiOMEs, 7 cards from Sky, 6 cards from Coast, and 5 cards from Mountain!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
