						               													<description>Contents:&amp;#10;Instructions&amp;#10;Game board&amp;#10;4 sets of checkers (1 set each of red, blue, white, &amp;amp; black)&amp;#10;4 playing pieces with flags (1 each of red, blue, white, &amp;amp; black)&amp;#10;2 standard decks of playing cards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played on a cross-shaped grid of five three-by-three blocks, with a 'king's space' at the terminal end of each branch.  The players each start on a branch of the cross by laying out 6 checkers and one horsemen (these 7 pieces are their knights) in the squares of the grid of their branch and their king's space. A player's turn consists of (1)drawing a card, (2)dueling another player's knight (optional), (3)turning in any pairs of cards you may have for more knights, and (4) moving any one knight to either an adjacent space or any available green space on the board, one of which allows a player to draw an extra card on their turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player starts a duel with another player, they each select a card from their hand, and higher card wins (king is high).  Ties are draws and both cards are discarded.  Re-dueling is optional. The winner draws a card from the draw pile AND takes both cards used in the duel (placed in 'pair's pile'), and loser removes their knight from the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Certain spaces on the board have numbers on them which require the attacker to play a card of that value or higher, while the defender may play any card value. Jokers may be played at any time to steal a random card from an opponent's hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After dueling, if you have any pairs (from either your hand or your 'pair's pile' ) you may turn as many as you wish in for more knights which are then placed in any space adjacent to another of your own knights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your goal is to have your knights occupying all four king spaces on the board.  You must always occupy at least one king space on the board, but not necessarily the one you started with.  If a person loses a duel for their last king space, all of their knights are removed from the board, and their cards are given to the winner of the duel.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
