						               													<description>In ancient days the Seeker, guardian of the Mets&amp;auml;suomalaiset people and endowed with five magical objects, journeyed within the Forest of Wyr, one with the natural world. The Seeker attracted the company of the Mennink&amp;auml;inen and Keiju, kindly though capricious forest spirits, while protecting those under his care from evil pursuits of the Ajatar.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are this Seeker, bound to the wood and the land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beware though, the Forest of Wyr is large and its paths many. Its elder trees can confuse the unwary and cause them &amp;#10;to lose their way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Seeker in the Forest of Wyr is a solitaire game lasting about 20 minutes. It needs only the deck of game cards, no dice or eurocubes required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To Win:&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to finish one of six Quests randomly chosen from the Quest Deck at the start of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play:&amp;#10;During each turn of the game you will choose one of the two bottommost row&amp;rsquo;s Stage Cards - your Seeker&amp;rsquo;s Path. Two of the goals (see next page) may make this choice for you. You must choose the card before you draw any cards to your hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Stage Card on the Seeker&amp;rsquo;s Path has a number in the upper left representing the Amount of Time you must take to overcome the card with the Abilities you have in your hand. The pointer icon next to the number shows whether you must have a total Abilities Number either great than or exactly one less than the Amount of Time needed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the cards in your hand, discard cards to your Seeker Deck&amp;rsquo;s discard pile, adding the Abilities Numbers in the upper left. of those you discard, to overcome the Stage Card you chose on the Seeker&amp;rsquo;s Path. Be sure when discarding cards to keep their current orientation when placing them on the discard pile (i.e. the current Abilities Numbers should be oriented upward when placed face down on the discard pile.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Magical Objects in your hand of cards can grant you special powers during your turn. You can play a Magical Object at any time during your turn. Discard them when you use their powers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you are able to overcome the Stage Card it will either be removed from the game, temporarily grant you a temporary Abilities bonus or penalty, be set in a special pile, or be added to your discard pile depending on the card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;End of the Game:&amp;#10;When the Quest Card is drawn from the Stage Deck&amp;rsquo;s draw pile, it is added to the Seeker&amp;rsquo;s Path and play continues normally in its final phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the Quest Card reaches the bottommost row of the Seeker&amp;rsquo;s Path (The Quest Card always has the highest Initiative Number when deciding what cards to move at the end of a turn) the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2014 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Awards&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Best Artwork&amp;#10;First Place&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Best Medium Sized Game&amp;#10;Second Place&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Best Written Rules&amp;#10;Second Place (Tied)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Most Innovative Mechanic&amp;#10;Second Place (Tied)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
