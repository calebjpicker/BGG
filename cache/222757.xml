						               													<description>User summary:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crabs?! Escape the Island is a competitive card game where each player is stranded on a &amp;quot;deserted&amp;quot; island.  The object of the game is to escape the island by building a raft out of Trees and Vines you can find in the Materials Deck, and collecting the required Rations.  An alternate win condition is available if you think you can &amp;quot;hack&amp;quot; it.  But, it's not so easy to win, as you'll be bombarded with various Crabs from the other players in an attempt to sabotage you so that they can be the first to Escape the Island.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These Crabs can steal your rations and materials, sneak a peak at your hand, cause you to lose an action, and take various other actions to hinder your success.  While you may decide to smash a Crabs with your Shovel, capture them with a Crab Cage, or worse, turn them into extra Rations by boiling them in a pot of water, every action/reaction you take will likely expose you to a worse outcome.  So, choose wisely!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is dealt 5 cards, and can take various Actions during their turn.  The number of actions you take per turn can change during gameplay, based upon what's in your Campsite, or play area.  You may play a card in your Campsite, play a Crab on another player, draw Rations, or attempt to collect Materials once you have the required tools.  There's a significant amount of decisions to be made in this game, as each Crab can be reacted to in some way.  You might choose to destroy the crab in numerous ways, capture it, redirect it to another player, or you might just deal with the punishment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once you've fought you way through all the Crabs and have collected the required Materials and Rations, you may triumphantly take your last action and Escape the Island by raft.  Alternatively, if you have managed to locate a special tool, ration, and enough rations for the journey, you may be in position to locate the Resort on the island and Win the Game that way.  But beware, if you make a break for it, you can bet all the other players will be looking to attack you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Various Gameplay modes&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Outside of normal gameplay which was developed for everyone to enjoy, we've included a few methods of gameplay to keep things interesting.  Rules have been altered to account for younger players, so this really is a game for the entire family.  But, for the more avid and hardcore gamers, there are Scenarios to play out, which will affect you in different ways each time you play, or Day/Night effects of the island that are designed to keep you guessing literally every round as to what might happen next to keep you from escaping.  Are you up to the challenge of Expert Mode?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
