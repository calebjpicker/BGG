						               													<description>The weather outside is gloomy - but inside, the cats are ready to have some fun. The mice have invited them to play hide and seek: find four mice to win the game. It&amp;rsquo;s not that simple though - those pesky mice just won&amp;rsquo;t keep still! Meanwhile, the dog is curious and wants to play... but wherever he goes, he is in the way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing the game:&amp;#10;When it is your turn to move, spin the spinner and move your cat the number of spaces the arrow indicates. You are allowed to leave the center room in any direction but afterward, you must move your cat in a clockwise direction on the outer circle. Landing on a specific space will trigger some event, depending if there is a mouse on it or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning the game:&amp;#10;The winner is the first player who finds their four mice and then goes to the room where the dog is to impress him.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
