						               													<description>In TSIA, the rules call for using a standard card deck, of which six cards cue the players to check for &amp;ldquo;Random Episodes&amp;rdquo; by rolling dice on one of 5 different tables. But the new Battle Event Deck eliminates all that, and includes almost half again as many &amp;ldquo;episodes&amp;rdquo; as appear in the original rules. Now there are fifty Event Cards, most of which have variables practically guaranteeing no two games can ever be alike.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some of the original &amp;ldquo;Episodes&amp;rdquo; have been retained; others modified in a variety of ways, and still more are entirely new. From army ants and African killer bees, to encounters with Elephant, Cape Buffalo, Rhinoceros, and more, to up close confrontations with snakes, Pygmies, flash floods, mysterious strangers, traitors, mutineers, The &amp;ldquo;King&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Queen&amp;rdquo; of the Jungle, and more to make your wild fights in the forest/bush/veldt even wilder!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;An advantage of the Battle Event Deck over the original tables is that once a card has been drawn, it cannot be repeated. But for those who still like that possibility, there is an optional &amp;ldquo;Reshuffle&amp;rdquo; card requiring all previously used cards to be returned to the deck!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Still more unique and unrepeated period graphics and photos decorate the cards, and there is that indispensable card with printed suggestions for more uses of the Battle Event Deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
