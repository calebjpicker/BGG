						               													<description>More Battle for China is an expansion set for Battle for China, a simulation game on the &amp;quot;War of Resistance Against Japan&amp;quot;, produced by the Microgame Design Group in 1999. The original game covered the period from 1937 to 1941. This expansion kit covers the period from 1942 to 1945, completing the Pacific War, and on into the 1945-49 Civil War period.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are three scenarios in this expansion set:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pacific War (1942-45): The Pacific War scenario can be played on its own or as an extension of the Basic game. In this scenario, the Chinese player will control all KMT, CCP, Western Allies, and Soviet units. The Japanese player will control all IJA and puppet troops units. Optionally, there may be a third player who controls all CCP units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Civil War (1946-49): For two players. The board has been cleared of foreign invaders; now begins the fight to determine who will rule the Chinese people.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Campaign Game(1937-49). For two or three players. Play begins in mid-1937 with the Basic Game, continues on until the Japanese surrender in China, and thence to the end of the resumed civil war between the Nationalists and Communists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two 8.5 x 11&amp;quot; half-maps extending the original map north to Siberia and south to India. 140 additional counters add more Communist Chinese, extra Japanese, Western Allied and Soviet units.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The expansion kit was once made by the Microgame Design Group, which is now defunct. The components of the kit are now made available as a free download by the game's designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;June 2009: The expansion kit has been included in &amp;quot;Battle for China Deluxe&amp;quot;, a special edition of the game by Fiery Dragon Productions. The package includes:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- 44-page integrated rulebook for all three games, with coil binding&amp;#10;- two red dice&amp;#10;- 12 cards for the various charts and tables for the three games&amp;#10;- 5 sheets of counters, for a total of 480 counters - consisting of the three sheets for the original game, and two new ones for the expansion. Counters might still be a bit thin for some tastes (but then they would not fit in the box) but the diecutting is good.&amp;#10;- 3 maps, the original 11x17&amp;quot; central map plus the north and south 8x11&amp;quot; extensions (Siberia-Manchuria and Siam-Burma-India, respectively). The North map matches up well and obviously. For the South map the area north of Burma-1 is Burma-3, and the area north of Burma-2 is Burma-4. The unnamed area north of India-8 is Nepal and is impassable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This was the last version of Battle for China to appear before the Decision Games edition of the basic 1937-41 game in late 2009. Production of the deluxe version is limited, fewer than 125 copies I believe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the Decision Games edition appears, the designer will post an updated and integrated set of rules and charts here, along with homemade redrawn extension maps to fit the larger 22x34&amp;quot; map. The counter sheets provided here do not need to be changed, but be advised that the counters in the Decision Games edition have been changed to iconic style, with a different format.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
