						               													<description>In Monster Workshop, you are a (slightly mad) scientist. Scour your lab to assemble the best available parts, and create the ultimate combat monster. Take your monster to battle and defeat the opposition! Be fastest, be strongest, be luckiest -- be victorious!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;OBJECT OF THE GAME: Build the strongest complete monster you can before your opponents do, by drawing and discarding cards. Then defeat your rival in combat! To complete your monster, collect cards depicting 1 head, 1 torso, 1 left arm, 1 right arm, and 1 pair of legs. The first two players to complete their monster will send their creations to battle to see who emerges the victor. Lay your best card hand on your individual player board to &amp;ldquo;bring your monster to life&amp;rdquo;! The first player to bring their monster to life has the advantage of striking first -- roll the included 20-sided die to achieve a winning score. Win two battles, and you win the game! Your gameplay can range from simple to monstrously strategic. Create a monster and fight with your friends in this electrifying card game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
