						               													<description>In Foursquare, you are the mayor of the fictional Flavortown, a trendy neighborhood known for being the birthplace of cutting-edge restaurants. New restaurants (cards) will be placed one at a time in a 4x4 grid. Placing the highest or lowest card in a&amp;#10;row or column causes all other cards in that row or column to flip over, as other restaurants go out of business or try to challenge the newcomer. Your task is to end up with sixteen open restaurants in your city, while preventing too many from being closed at once.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As part of the Isaludo collection, the rules can be found in this forum thread.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
