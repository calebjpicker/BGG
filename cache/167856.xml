						               													<description>Try to deliver your packet as soon as possible to mailman Johnny.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player chooses a card (indicating means of mail delivery transport) from his hand and passes it face down to his right of left neighbour (direction is given by Johnny the mailman). When all players have a hidden card in front of them, they turn the cards at the same time. The card in front of each player indicates which combination he/she should make. They have to see how much identical cards are revealed by other players, and how much identical cards they have on their hand. This indicates on which number they have to tap (2, 3 of 4) as soon as possible. If they see 5 identical cards, they shout &amp;quot;timbr&amp;eacute;&amp;quot; (=stamped).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players who tapped rightfully at 2, 3 of 4 can take pieces of a packet. They get 2 cards (showing parts of a postpacket) from the deck, keep 1 and discard the other one. The player who tapped the 3 can make, after choising from two cards, an additional move: steal a card from an other player. The player who could tap the 4 can choose a piece (out of two cards), steal another and gets the mailman. He/she also decides in which direction the cards are given in the next round. The players who tapped wrongfully, must discard a card from their packet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player can show 5 identical cards, he shouts &amp;quot;timbr&amp;eacute;&amp;quot;. He'll be the only one playing this round. He takes 5 cards from the deck, keep 1 and discard 4, steals a card and takes the mailman. The other players must discard a piece (card) of their packet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For the next round players take the card in front of them in their hands and play a hidden card to the right or left player, as isntructed by the (new) mailman.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as a player had his 6 pieces (cards) of the packet AND the mailman, he/she wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
