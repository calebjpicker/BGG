						               													<description>&amp;ldquo;We shall save our own land&amp;mdash;wipe away part of the score of our past disgrace, get excellent barracks and winter quarters, and at least be prepared for an early campaign another year.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;General Van Rensselaer&amp;rsquo;s summation of the benefits of gaining a secure foothold in the Niagara Peninsula before the onset of winter, September 1812.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A key element in the American campaign to take control Canada was securing the Niagara Peninsula in 1812.  This endeavor was increasingly important to the US war effort following the surrender of an entire American army at Detroit during the summer of 1812. However, a crossing of the Niagara River near Lake Ontario was guarded by Fort George, while those near Buffalo near Lake Erie were dominated by the Queenston Heights. The Americans gambled that a quick early morning assault on Queenston Heights could gain them a bridgehead that could very well lead to the capture of Ontario. Can you do as well, or better, than your historical counterparts? Learn and enjoy!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each copy of A Brilliant Fight is composed of the following:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;bull;    One 11 by 17 inch map with Turn Record Track.&amp;#10;&amp;bull;    100 double-sided counters.&amp;#10;&amp;bull;    This set of rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will also need a standard deck of playing cards and a six-sided die to play the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players use the cards to determine which player gets to activate and with how many units/formations, as wall as when to a random event can occur or the end of game turn. The six-sided die is used to resolve combats (fire or assault), as well as various game events (rally checks, random event determination).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
