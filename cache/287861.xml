						               													<description>NUTSO is the most outrageous card game you will ever play. A poker-styled card game designed for the entire family. It's like Texas Hold'em with a twist. Your hand is only as good as the last player's move. Let's just say if you think you have the best hand, you're probably wrong.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combine your two cards with the five community cards to make the best five card hand. Be the only player left by collecting all the NUTSO bucks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player receives a starting stack of NUTSO bucks totaling $15,000. Determine who will deal the first hand by dealing one card at a time to each player. First player dealt a NUTSO card deals first. The deal then alternates clockwise for the rest of the game unless someone plays the Pass The Button wild card and takes the deal. Helpful card: You can use the dealer card in the deck to keep track of who is dealing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before each hand is dealt, all players, except the dealer place $500 NUTSO bucks in the middle. The dealer then gives 2 card to each player and deals 5 cards face down in the middle, these are the community cards. After reviewing the 2 cards in their hands players can either stay in the game by placing the same amount of NUTSO bucks that started the hand or quit the hand. The decision to bet or fold starts with the player left to the dealer. After betting is over the dealer turns over the first 3 of the community card for another round of betting or folding. Each player is trying to build the winning hand using a combination of the 2 player cards and the 5 community cards. Dealer than turns over the fourth card for another round of betting and folding. Final community card is turned over for a final round of betting and folding. The showdown begins when all remaining players will expose their hands and the best hand wins all the NUTSO bucks in the middle. Winning hands look a lot like poker hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The real beauty of NUTSO are the wild cards. When played they can take down the strongest hand or turn a losing hand into a winner. Then again if you play one it might ruin your chances of winning. Who knows? That's why this game is called NUTSO.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
