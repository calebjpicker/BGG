						               													<description>A board game based on the 1997 Science Fiction movie The Postman. One player is the Postmen. The other player is the Holnists.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The map shows about 40 owns linked by roads and includes other features such as rivers, forests, and mountains. The distance between two adjacent towns linked by a road is called a space. Towns have a rating of either small, medium, or large (which affects recruit rolls).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are a variety of different types of units each of which have four differing statistics:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Move - the maximum number of spaces the unit can move in a turn. &amp;#10;     Fight - when rolling the D6 to attack, a roll of this number or higher will kill an enemy unit in the same town. &amp;#10;     Sneak &amp;ndash; a unit may attempt to move through a stack of enemy units. To do this, it must roll this number or higher on a D6. This stat is also used to retreat from an enemy that enters a unit&amp;rsquo;s location. &amp;#10;     Recruit - when rolling the D6 to recruit, a roll of this number or higher will convert a militia in the town into one of the player&amp;rsquo;s unit types. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A regular 52 card deck is used. The Postmen can use red cards. The Holnists can use black cards. Cards are played to influence dice rolls and statistics or to generate special events.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns with the The Postmen going first. Each turn is divided up into five phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Move Phase&amp;#10;          Units can move a number of spaces up to their move stat rating and may attempt to move through a stack of enemy units by rolling their sneak number or higher on a D6. &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;     Fight Phase&amp;#10;          If opposing units are in the same town, they will fight. All units get to make one attack and all attacks are simultaneous. &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;     Recruit Phase&amp;#10;         Each unit may make 1 recruit roll if it occupies a town with 1 or more militia in order to convert 1 militia in the town into one of its unit types. &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;     Militia Phase&amp;#10;         If a town is unoccupied by Postman or Holnist Units roll 1D6 to see whether a militia unit appears. &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;     Mail Phase&amp;#10;         Draw 2 cards. Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &amp;#10;    &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of the game is to destroy the opposing Leader Unit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
