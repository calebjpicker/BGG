						               													<description>You..You really are incorruptible, aren't you? You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self -righteousness, and I won't kill you because you are to much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever? - The Joker&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Joker is one of Batman's oldest and greatest foes. A mirror of the Bat himself, the Joker stands for everything Batman is against. Chaos, disorder and crime without reason.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Possibly one of Batman's greatest failures when the Red Hood fell into a vat of chemicals, the Joker has plagued Batman, his allies and Gotham City ever since.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nobody knows who he really is and even the Joker himself has told several different origin stories. If he's going to have one, he would prefer it to be multiple choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Seeing murder, chaos and his 'dance' with Batman as one big joke, the Joker is one of the most dangerous men Batman has ever faced. Using countless resources including his own Joker Gas, he tries to take down Gotham and 'Batsy' again and again. Only to end up each time in Arkham Asylum.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During one stay in Arkham, the Joker met Dr. Harleen Quinzel. A psychiatrist that developed an obsession with the Joker that led her to become Harley Quinn and follow her 'puddin' on his journey of insanity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Some of the Jokers worst crimes include paralysing Barbara Gordon / Batgirl and killing Batman's own sidekick Jason Todd / Robin. Batman has sworn not to kill, but can the Joker push him over the edge?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Using a Joker crew in the Batman Miniatures Game is to bring chaos to the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A dangerous man in his own right with weapons like a poisoned knife, one shot gun and explosive teeth, the Jokers true strength comes from his ability to change his crews plans at the last minute with the use of Kaos Agent. This means your opponent can never really know what you are going to do until it's too late.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Having Harley Quinn as a Sidekick can help with the mass chaos as she can even change your opponents plans while her True Love for the Joker means she can become very dangerous if her 'puddin' is taken down. Or if you need some muscle instead, Mr Hammer is happy to help.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Jokers Clown Henchmen are very basic fighters all armed with a range of different weapons. They are easy to take down one by one, but being cheap to hire, there can be enough on the table to pull off any crime. There are also a few Elite Clowns if you want some Henchmen that are a bit more resilient and hit harder.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Joker crew has access to all sorts of Free Agents to help them out. Killer Croc adds some serious muscle to the crew when it's needed and is quick to move around to where he is needed via the sewers. Scarecrow can help keep the insanity under control while also messing with the opponents plans further by forcing models to activate first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overall, the Joker crew is great for anyone to play. Kaos Agent makes it easy on new players while messing with your opponents plans can be fun for more experienced players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contains:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 metal miniatures:&amp;#10;- Joker&amp;#10;- Clown&amp;#10;- Ringmaster&amp;#10;- Contra-Auguste&amp;#10;Stat cards for the characters&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
