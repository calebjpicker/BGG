						               													<description>Inside the Cup is a simulation of the sport of golf using PGA Tour players and courses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The development of the game started as a spinoff of the old Avalon Hill Golf game and then blossomed into something all its own. The stats the PGA tour keeps are much more detailed than ever before allowing for players to really show their strengths and weaknesses on golfer cards. Golfers are rated for driving length and accuracy. The cards show the golfers&amp;rsquo; ability to hit greens from all distances along with proximity to the hole. Scrambling shots from the sand or around the green are captured as well as putting ability for distance and keeping away from the 3 putt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Courses are depicted in colorful segments showing the good and the bad places on each hole. As shots are hit they end up in quadrants on the course that show the next club that will need to be used. Stay in the fairway and your next shot should be easier and hold better on the green. Hitting out of the rough or worse can make the shot to the green harder and might not hold up like you like. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be too far off the green as those areas could spell danger, while around the green shows safer chip shots or bunkers to hit out of. Some greens even have adjustments that make them easier to hole out or some are more likely to bring out a 3 putt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gamers can just let the golfers&amp;rsquo; golf or you can have some strategic decisions to make. Should I hit a little less club onto this narrow fairway? Go for it on this par 5? Should I go pin hunting or just play it safe to the middle of the green? Should I putt aggressively or just lag it up there and get off this green?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are even ways to quick play the game. You can go hole by hole or finish a round with one roll of the dice. ITCG is a fairly fast playing game that can allow a gamer to take his favorite golfers out on some of his favorite courses without leaving his own table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
