						               													<description>Los Intocables is a game of smuggling and chase racing with modular board and houses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 6 board bases to put them together creating a new city each time.&amp;#10;There are different types of cards in a pile: Luckily, record, action, alarm, tip, extra, raid, explosion, incident.&amp;#10;The lucky ones can be kept in hand for later use, the rest are immediately executed and discarded.&amp;#10;There are tiles to place on the board, both police station (secret / fake) and distillery (illegal / fake)&amp;#10;There are 7 buildings, 1 bank, 2 police stations and 2 bars, each building is a player's base.&amp;#10;There are many cars, in cars you can hide tokens as contraband.&amp;#10;The gangsters must obtain as much money as possible through smuggling or theft and the police must intercept them by dismantling distilleries and vehicles&amp;#10;The gangsters win by accumulated money while the policemen do it by the amount of confiscated car-stills.&amp;#10;Control barriers can be placed to prevent exits through certain streets.&amp;#10;Gangsters must flee after delivering contraband or robbing a bank as they are marked until they leave the board.&amp;#10;The strategic placement of the central police and bar buildings and the secret police station and distillery tiles is important as it determines the difficulty of each team.&amp;#10;The police should try to keep distillery tiles away from bars and bars from exits.&amp;#10;The mafia team for their part should try to place the distilleries near the bars and these near the exits of the city to reduce the persecution, always in blocks of buildings and not on the road or street.&amp;#10;The bench is placed by mutual agreement between both teams.&amp;#10;The cars are placed on the board in the module where each player's base is located.&amp;#10;The game progresses as follows, a player draws a card and plays or saves it according to the one that came out, makes a dice roll that resolves how many cars are moving and how much they are moving, there cannot be 2 cars in the same road cell, but it can be overtaken.&amp;#10;The special value die is used to determine how much money is in the bank during a robbery.&amp;#10;The cops must try to intercept all the gangster cars discovered, following a bank robbery or a delivery from a distillery.&amp;#10;When a car passes a secret police station, the police can intercept it by turning the tile and searching the vehicles next to it.&amp;#10;A vehicle with contraband is immediately stopped at the secret police station control and must pay a fine or it is eliminated,&amp;#10;There are letters that give the right to registration and that allow you to see if you are a smuggler or not.&amp;#10;You can also risk losing a police car if you decide to search with a patrol car and there is no contraband, but if there is a shooting of the dice. In the shootout, either party may be arrested / withdrawn or killed depending on the dice rolls and modifier cards played.&amp;#10;You also have to discover and dismantle the distillery tiles, playing the appropriate cards or detect the situation of the secret police station tiles to avoid their controls.&amp;#10;The cards also allow moving the control barriers that close some of the exits of the city, both to one team and another.&amp;#10;The smugglers and thieves achieve their objective as soon as they manage to leave the city and obtain the corresponding economic reward.&amp;#10;The policemen achieve their objectives by preventing the cars from leaving the city, arresting or killing them, and dismantling distilleries.&amp;#10;The game ends when half of the gangsters' troops disappear (cars and / or tiles) or when they manage to accumulate a predetermined amount of money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
