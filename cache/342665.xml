						               													<description>Diamond Heist is a compact 2-4 player strategic dice-rolling game about stealing diamonds, with a cast of unique characters, each with interesting abilities. Diamond Heist features fun art, a relaxing theme, and elegant gameplay all packaged together for decades of family fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts by selecting one of the many unique characters. Each turn, players roll dice, and must decide whether they want to lock in their arsenal of guns, knives, bulletproof vests, pickpocket action, or take a chance and re-roll. Vests block guns, and helmets block knives. Each unblocked attack allows the player to steal a diamond from the opposing player. To add additional strategy, players must balance doing direct damage, and building up cash reserves. Cash can be spent on each player's character ability, which ranges from stealing mass amounts of diamonds, to blocking certain damage types, to swapping 2 players' dice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can save up if they roll Bonus Cash, to spend on their character speciality. Players must balance short term and long term rewards for building up cash. Then, players battle it out with their selected arsenal, stealing as many diamonds and as much cash as they can.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Diamond Heist relies on easy to learn, but hard to master strategies with a cast of interesting characters to keep gameplay fresh. Manage your strategy with 4 competing players, to be able to steal diamonds when they are vulnerable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Diamond Heist keeps things new, fun and challenging by including a selection of 18 different characters. Combinations of these creates numerous matchup possibilities, each with their own strategy to consider.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, there are a lot of things to pay attention to.  You must make decisions whether you will keep a guaranteed dice roll, or risk it to try to get something better. Players will need to weigh whether they want to steal cash to use their special abilities, or steal diamonds to add to their Offshore Accounts. Another tough decision will be whether to spend your cash for short term gains, or save up for a larger impact special ability. In 3 and 4 player games, you may need to team up and form alliances with other players, while making sure you have enough defenses such that you don&amp;rsquo;t get backstabbed yourself!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
