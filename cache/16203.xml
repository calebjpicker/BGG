						               													<description>This game has taken the old recess and study hall pass time of paper football and turned it into an &amp;quot;officially licensed product&amp;quot; of the NFL. And they did a great job with it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game comes with flat cardboard triangles for the footballs. What is cool is that each one has the name and logo of an actual NFL team. And yes, they made expansion packs so you could &amp;quot;collect them all&amp;quot;. It also comes with a very cool item, a field goal that you put together and stand up for when you attempt an extra point.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played by two opponents stationed at opposite ends of a tabletop surface. The person who goes first flicks or slides the football toward the other end of the table. If it is touched by the opponent a field goal attempt is allowed for the &amp;quot;flicker&amp;quot;. Otherwise, a touchdown is made when part of the football rests over the edge of the table but doesn't fall off. Then an extra point can be attempted if a score is made. If a score is not made, the other person attempts to score, and so on until a winner is declared.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game was first introduced in 1994.  The inaugural events which introduced the game were sponsored jointly by the NFL and Ocean Spray.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tournaments were established around the country at thousands of Universities, with a grand prize package at stake for a team of four to attend the Superbowl with all expenses paid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
