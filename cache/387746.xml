						               													<description>Each turn represents an academic year in which the player will use worker placement to choose a strategic focus for their university. They can hire staff, create scholarships to attract students, build facilities and staff them with administrators, or announce a new strategic plan - maybe even one that jacks up tuition again!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Separately, players choose a day-to-day focus for the year: making money or teaching students. They can't do both! After all, it is hard to focus on teaching when you are busy promoting the big game to improve ticket sales.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every four years, students will graduate and affect their university's reputation. Star athletes improve athletics reputation, high performers academic reputation, and so on. Players must then admit new students, and begin again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After four cohorts of students have graduated, players score prestige from reputation, facilities, faculty committees, and more - the most prestigious university is the winner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
