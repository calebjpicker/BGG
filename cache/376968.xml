						               													<description>A game of averts and spells for subversive witches! Diana, the queen of the witches, has passed on, through her daughter Aradia, the knowledge of the old religion to the women of the people; explaining to them how to perform averts to avenge the oppressions they have suffered.&amp;#10;Today, on the sacred day of the Moon, the most powerful witches have gathered to challenge each other to find out who will be the chosen one to whom Aradia will reveal the secret of Magic!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goal of the game&amp;#10;To complete the greatest number of Conjuration with the required Ingredient Cards, thus accumulating points.&amp;#10;Each Conjuration has a point value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Conduct of the Game&amp;#10;Distribute to each player 4 Ingredients Cards at random (5 in the case of Morgana), place on the table 5 Conjurors to complete and 4 free Ingredients Cards face up, thus forming the Witches &amp;quot;Market&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;Starting with whoever last stroked a cat (in case of a tie, whoever stroked a black cat wins), each player must place a minimum of 1 ingredient up to a maximum of 3 on one or more of the Conjurors on the table.&amp;#10;If he or she cannot do so, he or she must reveal his or her hand to his or her opponents and turn over the cards in the Ingredient Cards deck until he or she finds one that can be used on a Conjuring. Cards thus uncovered and unused should be shuffled back into the deck.&amp;#10;In addition to playing Ingredient Cards, during his or her turn, each player may also perform the following actions in any order (even BEFORE placing the ingredient on the Conjuring)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;      Draw an ingredient card by choosing it from the Marketplace or drawing it covered from the deck&amp;#10;     Use the abilities of one's Witch.&amp;#10;     Use the Spell of a Witch (see below)&amp;#10;     Place a Corrupted Ingredient on an already played Grain, Water, or Lemon (also outside your turn)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a Conjuration, placing both cards in the discard pile.&amp;#10;The following steps are also performed before passing the turn:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     A check is made to see if one or more Conjurors have been completed. In that case, the player who placed the last ingredient takes the completed and places them next to his Witch card. As many Conjurors are drawn and placed on the table as needed to return to 5.&amp;#10;     You replenish the Market deck until you return to 4 the Ingredients Cards shown as soon as they are less than 4&amp;#10;     You draw cards from the Covered Ingredient Cards deck until you reform your hand of 4 cards (5 in the case of Morgana)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Spell of a Conjuration&amp;#10;Each Conjuration has a Spell attached to it. When a player who has already completed a Conjuration wants to use it, he must-in his turn unless otherwise indicated-read aloud the text portion of the ritual and then use the Spell listed on the card. Each spell can be used only once; to remember it turn the Conjuration card upside down with the spell that was used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
