						               													<description>Although there are a number of simulations for the dramatic events in Bavaria, Austrian and Spain in 1809, not much emphasis has been placed on conflicts in Prussia or in the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. However there were uprisings and armies in conflict in Eastern Europe, especially in the newly created Duchy of Warsaw.&amp;#10;La Bataille de Raszyn depicts the major battle between the VII Austrian Armeekorps and the Polish Forces defending Warsaw. The invasion force commanded by Archduke Ferdinand d&amp;rsquo;Este drives toward the capital of Poland being defended by General Poniatowski.  Poniatowski decides to defend a crucial river crossing that has limited crossings and swampy ground.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The forces of Poniatowski are limited as much of the Polish forces are fighting in Spain. His available forces have excellent morale being highly motivated to defend a country once partitioned by Austrian, Prussia and Russia. A contingent of Saxons assist the Polish Army and scenarios add a variety of forces from neighboring areas.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;D&amp;rsquo; Este &amp;lsquo;Austrian&amp;rsquo; Army is in fact made up of infantry from Hungary and Galician (Poland), with Grenz (border) troops and a sizable number of elite cavalry. Although this army outnumbers the forces of Poniatowski, it may lack the motivation and leadership of their counterpoints. The Austrian Army&amp;rsquo;s tactics include some of the recent reforms and traditional formations. Option rules and scenarios provide for a number of &amp;lsquo;what ifs&amp;rdquo; and fresh simulations&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game that can be completed in an afternoon. In addition to the historical game there are two scenarios that vary the orders of battle and appearance times.&amp;#10;The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original  rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.&amp;#10;Marshal Enterprises intends to publish a Napoleonic Grand Tactical Game every quarter. The games are free by down loading all the required documents at our website. Each specific title will have a Special Rules Package.  Options include printing the map as a series of 11&amp;rdquo;x17&amp;rdquo; pages or as a  two or one piece file. Instructions are included to make the unit and informational counters.  Keep you r money for something important and have fun battling in Poland&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
