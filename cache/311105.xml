						               													<description>Dogo Dash&amp;#10;Dogo Dash is a quick-playing, super-colorful card game for 2 to 5 players. It&amp;rsquo;s a game of dogs and cats, bears and humans, where one is always trying to outdo the other. Who is going to come out on top? Will the Good Boys cause trouble for the Bears? Or will Cats woo over Cookie? Only a game of Dogo Dash will tell!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Components&amp;#10;1 rule sheet&amp;#10;60 cards&amp;#10;&amp;bull;    22 Cats&amp;#10;&amp;bull;    18 Dogs&amp;#10;&amp;bull;    12 Bears&amp;#10;&amp;bull;    4 Cookies&amp;#10;&amp;bull;    4 Good Boys&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]Setup[/i][/b]&amp;#10;1.    Shuffle the deck of cards face down.&amp;#10;2.    Deal four cards to each player. This forms your hand. Keep your cards secret!&amp;#10;3.    Place the deck face down in reach of all players. This is the draw deck.&amp;#10;4.    Now you&amp;rsquo;re ready to play. It&amp;rsquo;s that easy!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]Gameplay[/b][/i]&amp;#10;Dogo Dash is played over multiple rounds. At the end of each round, players determine the winner of the round and score points. Then, everyone draws more cards. Once the draw deck is empty, one final round occurs and then the game ends. The player with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]Round[/b][/i]&amp;#10;Each round, players follow the same order of play.&amp;#10;1.    All players secretly choose a card from their hand they want to play.&amp;#10;2.    Place it face down in front of you and don&amp;rsquo;t show it to anyone.&amp;#10;3.    When everyone has chosen a card, someone yells out DO-GO DAAAAASH!&amp;#10;4.    All players reveal their cards simultaneously.&amp;#10;5.    Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to see who won!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]Round Winner[/b][/i]&amp;#10;To determine the winner, check the played cards to see who played the strongest one:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dog is stronger than Cat&amp;#10;Bear is stronger than Dog and Cat&amp;#10;Cookie is stronger than Dog and Bear&amp;#10;Cat is stronger than Cookie&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whoever played the strongest card takes all of the played cards and keeps them in a score pile in front of them. Each card counts as a point at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If there is a tie between two or more players for the strongest card, the tied players play another round between themselves but do not draw any additional cards. They continue playing until someone wins or they have played all of their cards. If no one wins, then the players split the points as evenly as possible, discarding the extra card if it&amp;rsquo;s an odd amount.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Watch out! If there is a Good Boy on the table, things get tricky.&amp;#10;Good Boys force a tie, no matter what cards are on the table. Play another round as detailed above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once the winner has been determined, all players draw cards until they have four cards in hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]Last Round[/b][/i]&amp;#10;The Last Round happens when there are no more cards to draw from the draw deck. Players now play one more round only using the cards they have left in hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1.    All players secretly choose a card and place it face down in front of you.&amp;#10;2.    All players take all of their unplayed cards in their hands and put them face down in the middle of the table. This makes the Super Pot!&amp;#10;3.    Someone yells out DO-GO DAAAAASH! and all players reveal their cards simultaneously.&amp;#10;4.    The winner takes all of the cards in the Super Pot!&amp;#10;o    If there is a tie, the tied players split the Super Pot as evenly as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]Scoring[/b][/i]&amp;#10;Once the Last Round has been played, count the cards you have collected.&amp;#10;Whoever has collected the most cards wins.&amp;#10;If there is a tie, then all tied players win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]Keep Your Eyes Open[/b][/i]&amp;#10;If you pay attention to what cards have been played, then you can stay ahead of everyone else. Try and remember the number of different cards there are and use it in your favor to choose the right card at the&amp;#10;right time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For instance: if you paid attention to how many Cookies were played, you can win the Super Pot with a cat, which is the character beaten by most cards, but wins against Cookie.&amp;#10;Combos&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]The Catnip Variant[/b][/i]&amp;#10;When you get comfortable with the basics, here&amp;rsquo;s an extra move to add to the game.&amp;#10;If you have four cats in your hand, you can choose to play a Catnip:&amp;#10;1.    Instead of playing one card, you put down all four cards and say &amp;lsquo;catnip.&amp;rsquo;&amp;#10;2.    You then put all four of your played cards onto your own score pile. You didn&amp;rsquo;t win the round, but you keep the points for yourself.&amp;#10;3.    3. Everyone else continues the round as normal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b][i]The Dogo Dash![/b][/i]&amp;#10;If you played a Dog and didn&amp;rsquo;t win the round, but you have another Dog in your hand, then you can make a Dogo Dash! Before the winner takes the cards, reveal your second Dog card. You now get to keep the Dog you just played and the Dog you just rescued from the winner. Put both cards in your score pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[b]Credits[/b]&amp;#10;Author &amp;amp; Game Designer: Talita Rhein&amp;#10;Illustrator &amp;amp; Co-Designer: Margherita Barrera&amp;#10;Co-Designer: Johanna Janiszewski&amp;#10;Production Support &amp;amp; QA: Philipp Keydel&amp;#10;Rules Editing: Travis D.
