						               													<description>Draftamania: Rise of the promotions is the fast-paced card game of wrestling promotion management. A game of Draftamania takes place over a number of turns. Each turn comprises of three phases:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Pre-Show phase - Where players draft wrestlers to their roster and buy special Booster cards (to both improve their Roster and to hinder their opponents). Each player draws a House Show card and books their wrestlers to appear in their show. Finally decisions are made about the outcomes of the various segments such as which wrestlers are receiving pushes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Showtime phase - Where players take turns describing (commentating) their Show and roll the dice to determine the results of the various Segments. Even the best laid plans and flawless booking can be undone on the night by bad luck, injuries or a crucially timed disruptive Boosters played by an opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Post-Show phase - In the aftermath of the show players vote to give the best General Manager award to one player. Additionally, gate receipts are calculated, Rosters reorganised and Wrestler&amp;rsquo;s appeased.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The phases are played simultaneously by the players with the exception of part of the Showtime phase where players take turns to commentate on their own show and roll the dice to decide the results of Segments. During the each of the phases the players will have the opportunity to build a roster of wrestlers for their Promotion.  These wrestlers are further developed with Booster cards, such as pleasing moves, story lines, equipment and arenas, dirty tricks to play on rival player's promotions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Finally each player will then book their Wrestlers into Shows and Pay-Per-View special events in order to gain Popularity Points (PP). At the end of each Post-Show phase, the players count their Popularity Points; the player who reaches the goal number (different for the different variants) has managed to impress Network TV bosses, signed a TV Network deal and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
