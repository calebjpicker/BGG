						               													<description>Pack your bags, get ready&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;re going on an adventure! We&amp;rsquo;ll travel through the dense jungle of Amazonia, the scorching desert of Tenere, the icy mountains of Makalu and the fiery skies of Shangri La to collect mystical treasures. But beware, perils lie everywhere. Anyone can enter but only a few can escape&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trailblazers is an exciting memory drawing game that your family will not get enough of. The goal is simple: see a map, spot the treasures and obstacles, remember them and then draw your own way out of it using memory and some basic rules. Then, spin away and maximise your points! Sounds simple but is a laughing riot when opponents take a wrong turn. &amp;#10;Enjoy as your kids use principles of geometry, memory and strategy to draw their way through various adventure worlds. See them master basic concepts of lines and angles, decision making and motor skills right before your eyes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Trail Blazers, players travel through four different adventures, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. The goal is to draw your way out of each maze in the adventure region. Everybody starts with a Path Map, and a sketch pen. Place the adventure book in the centre. Choose an adventure region, and start with Maze 1. Cover the maze with the Spin-A-Round spinner. Keep your sand timer ready.&amp;#10;VIEWING ROUND (30 secs) - When the timer begins, all players must visualise and remember a path in the maze from Start to Finish. &amp;#10;During this time, players are not allowed to draw anything. All pens must be down!&amp;#10;At the end of 30 seconds, the maze is covered again with the Spin-A-Round spinner.&amp;#10;DRAWING ROUND (60 secs) - All players draw their paths on their Path Maps from Start to Finish. They must try to score maximum points by collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. All players must enter with a Ray at the Start point and exit with a Ray at the Finish point. You can enter or exit horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. All paths must be individual line segments, connecting the dots on the path maps from Start to Finish. All paths must be horizontal or vertical and not diagonal. At the end of the drawing round, each player counts their score by placing their path map on the maze in the adventure book. Each coin you collect in your path, you get the points mentioned on it. Each obstacle you hit, you lose points as mentioned on the left hand pages. Add all points for the coins collected, subtract all points for the obstacles hit, add 2 points for entering with a ray at the correct Start point and add 2 points for exiting with a ray at the correct Finish point. This is your score for the drawing round. &amp;#10;SPINNING ROUND - The player with the highest score for this maze, spins the spinner. Now, choose either your entry or exit Ray as the reference Ray. If you get a Parallel, then you count all lines parallel to the reference Ray. If you get a Perpendicular, then you count all lines perpendicular to the reference Ray. Then you multiply the number above by either x1 or x2 as per what they have spun. This is your score for the spinning round. &amp;#10;Add the scores of the Drawing and Spinning round as the final score for maze 1. Repeat  the same for Mazes 2 and 3 in the adventure region. The person with the highest total of all three mazes, wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
