						               													<description>Last Move Wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Making the last move is how you win this game. Each player has six cubes that can slide, push and spin. Each cube starts out with the ability to move in three different directions; horizontally, vertically or diagonally. All 12 cubes will remain on the board throughout the game whether they are able to move or not. Cubes must always move in a straight line and cannot pass another cube diagonally if that cube&amp;rsquo;s side comes in contact. A cube may not jump over another cube, or land on top of another cube. A cube loses a direction of movement as indicated by colored triangle when a cube from the other player is pushed into it. It is possible to engage more than one cube at a time. Cubes without colored triangles are considered dead and are unable to move on their own, though it can be pushed by other cubes. Cubes can push other cubes, both their own or their opponent, but for this to happen there must be more triangles pointing in the direction of the push than there are triangles opposed to the push. If two cubes have opposing triangles that point into each other, they cancel each other out and there is no push either way. Cubes may not pull another cube. Cubes can only move forward in the direction of the 90 degree triangles. Triangles can turn a round when they reach the three gray squares at each end, and can move back and forth from those gray squares. When a player runs out of moves the game is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
