						               													<description>In Ronin, by Tiago Junges, you play a lone samurai who has been stripped of his rank due to a dark past that you must uncover. As a ronin, you will travel the paths of an imaginary feudal Japan, visiting villages and towns where the fragments of your history are hidden.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Armed with your sword and relying on your spirit, you will have to face enemies, rivals and even supernatural creatures waiting to put an end to your pilgrimage. Not only that, but three mysterious villains, who seem to be part of your past, are waiting to do away with you. How are you related to the great main villain and why is he so interested in you?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Customise your ronin with choices about fighting style, appearance, family background, secrets... and more.&amp;#10;Live with your recurring nightmare, a dream whose origin and meaning you don't know, but which plays a fundamental role in the development of your story.&amp;#10;Face not only combat, but also moral decisions as you travel the roads in search of the truth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
