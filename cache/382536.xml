						               													<description>Clash is a card game for 2-4 players and the age target is 7 and above. Clash is a simple and easy game to play with some level of strategy involved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game starts with each player setting up a defense, after which they have to destroy each other&amp;rsquo;s defenses and then beat each other out in a duel. The last player standing wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of attack cards with different numbers, as well as 5 different action cards. The attack cards are primarily used to attack the opponents, whereas the action cards have different functions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gameplay (How to play):&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Shuffle the deck&amp;#10;     Deal 8 random cards to each player.&amp;#10;     All players set up 3 Defense cards, which leaves 5 cards in hand.&amp;#10;     In turn, use the Attack cards to destroy enemy defenses and use the Action cards to turn the tide of the battle to your advantage.&amp;#10;     The game is played in a clockwise direction and the person to the left of the dealer starts the game.&amp;#10;     All players will in turn try to destroy each other&amp;rsquo;s defenses.&amp;#10;         Players are allowed to perform up to 2 moves (plays) when it&amp;rsquo;s their turn as long as the moves are not of the same card type. E.g. it&amp;rsquo;s not allowed to play 2 Attack cards or 2 Action cards, but instead, playing an Action card followed by an Attack card is allowed.&amp;#10;         Use the Action cards to turn the tide of the game to your advantage&amp;#10;         Attack enemy defenses and destroy them all&amp;#10;         When the opportunity comes, reinforce your defense&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;     When a player loses all 3 Defense cards, then the player may be challenged by other players to a duel. The duel is carried out by both the duel initiator (the attacker) and the player with no defenses left (the defender) playing an attack card faced down, after which both cards are revealed at the same time.&amp;#10;         If the defender's card is weaker than the attacker's card, then the duel is lost and the defender is out of the game.&amp;#10;         If the defender's card is stronger than the attacker's card, then the duel is won and the defender is rewarded with +1 new Defense card (placed from the cards in hand). The defender gets to continue the game.&amp;#10;    &amp;#10;     The last player remaining wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
