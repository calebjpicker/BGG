						               													<description>Get out of Colditz Card Game (and separately available Expansion Pack)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;56 cards per deck. One deck required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are held in Colditz Castle, a WWII German POW camp reserved for the elite of escapers and special prisoners. Can you Escape from Colditz Castle?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1-6 players age 7+&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SINGLE PLAYER:&amp;#10;The object of the Single Player game is to piece together one or more escape chains to allow a total of three Escapers (together or one at a time) a &amp;lsquo;HOME RUN&amp;rsquo; to freedom before the Guard draw pile runs out. The escape chains are achieved by forming a column of sequential cards in front of you numbered 1-4. Upon your third Escaper escaping, you win the game against the Guards! With an optional Expansion Pack 8 Escapers should be the target.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MULTIPLAYER:&amp;#10;The object of the Multiplayer game is to be the first to piece together one or more escape chains to allow a single Escaper a &amp;lsquo;HOME RUN&amp;rsquo; to freedom. You also play Action Cards against your opponents, stopping their own escape attempts. The escape chains are achieved by forming a column of 4 sequential cards in front of you numbered 1-4. Upon laying your HOME RUN card, you win the game against your opponents! Hints to help you on multi-player are shown on each card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CREATOR&amp;rsquo;S NOTE:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I prototyped this game after dreaming it up at Christmas. I scribbled it frantically on bits of card and played with my wife and kids (17 and 21). Brutal fun as someone commented is spot on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the addictive multiplayer mode there was short-lived gloating at apparently strong hands, poker faces pretending a good hand, frustration, Intense rivalry between the kids, fist pumping joy and laughter at someone else&amp;rsquo;s plight. Confiscating each other&amp;rsquo;s cherished cards was contentious. The diversion cards being played out of turn were priceless double-crossing targeted at who has annoyed you the most and part of the joy and pain of playing with friends or family. I think in football they say there is no such thing as a friendly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The single player is a different game altogether. The black guard pack sits there silent and seems to know what you are planning, coming up with cards like it&amp;rsquo;s been tipped of by a snitch. You dread the Inevitable Traitor card making his appearance. But then there is the joy of getting a good run going, tempered with wondering on the turn of each card whether your luck is about to come to an abrupt end. There are 14 escapers waiting in your pack and extension pack for a home run, and the first person to ever get all 14,  I would tell them to go buy a lottery ticket. They will command the luck of the gods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
