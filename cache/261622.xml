						               													<description>Predators, also known as yautja, are an alien race that is best known for their hunting of the most dangerous prey in the galaxy, including humans and xenomorphs. These Hunts, as they are known, are done for honor, sport, and as a rite of passage for young Predators looking to become adults in their own right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They are a sentient race that is humanoid in appearance, but larger than most actual humans in size, standing well  over  seven  feet  tall  and  weighing  300  lbs  or  more  in  many  cases.  They  breathe  an  atmosphere  that  is  similar to Earth&amp;rsquo;s, though with a higher degree of nitrogen. Their faces have been seen to have quill-like hair on their brows, cheeks, and chins. Their mouths have four mandibles they use to help communicate or to show emotion,  several  sharp  teeth  used  to  tear  flesh,  and  a  small,  thin,  snake-like  tongue.  Their  elongated  heads  have a crown of thick bone and end in a mass of long appendages that have been nicknamed dreadlocks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As  with  humans,  their  skin  color  can  vary  from  light  to  dark  hues,  as  well  as  striped  and  mottled  patterns.&amp;#10;While  primitive  and  tribal  in  appearance,  their  technology  is  extremely  advanced.  Their  armor  and  weapons  &amp;#10;are made from an alloy that is resistant to even the corrosive effects of a xenomorphs acid blood. Most of them &amp;#10;mount a plasma caster on their shoulder; a powerful energy cannon able to kill most of their enemies in a single &amp;#10;shot that utilizes a high-tech, triple targeting laser to track their foes. Other weapons include combi-sticks, which are collapsible spears, and smart-disks that can eliminate multiple enemies in a single throw.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their left arm, each yautja wears a wrist-gauntlet which allows them to access many different systems. It controls their cloaking ability, access and remote piloting control of their ships, local terrain layouts, and even contains  a  miniature  nuclear  explosive  to  ensure  that  their  technology  doesn&amp;rsquo;t  fall  into  their  enemy&amp;rsquo;s  hands.  &amp;#10;Some more evolved Predators even incorporate a second set of wrist-blades or even more weaponry packed into them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
