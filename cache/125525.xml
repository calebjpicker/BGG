						               													<description>Nickropolis is a grave robbing game, where you, as a thief, try to swipe as much loot from the necropolis as you can before you're sealed in forever. The hex card graveyard is laid out differently each game. Move from tomb to tomb, fighting the undead for their treasures, while avoiding traps and the other theives. One word of warning though. You'll want to race to get your goods to the surface. The necropolis locks itself down as you play, so you not only have to collect the loot, you must return to the center periodically and toss the loot up to score it. You can also pickpocket the other thieves if you don't want to fight the undead for it. Nickropolis is a quick, easy to learn, and rather brutal game. If you do join the undead in the tombs, you can still haunt the other thieves and win. Happy stealing!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Story:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your buddy Marley motions for you to join him at a dark table crammed in the corner of the bar. You and the other thieves go over and seat yourselves around him. He looks around nervously before he speaks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Got a job for you. You know they're planting Ol' Lady Elston tonight? Gonna do some spooky ceremony before they put her in that family necropolis. Listen up. Gatekeeper Willy is in charge of unlocking the mausoleum, and Willy likes his bottle. So I'm gonna make sure he has a nice full one tonight, because that's the kind of guy I am. Once he's hammered, you break in. Got a good map. I'll keep a lookout up top and sort out your loot. Just one thing, you got to be quick. That place has some kind of clockwork mechanism that will seal you down in there with all them dead Elston's, and you don't want that. They say some of them ain't quite as dead as they should be. Now whoever tosses up the most loot items will be known as the king of the thieves around here. You in?&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
