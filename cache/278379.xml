						               													<description>This is a dice game for players who enjoy the hazards of the casino. All players start with 20 chips. The game board is divided into four sections. Each section has 5 identical lanes lead from START to a finish on a GREEN Square. Each player chooses one section and places five chips on the squares marked &amp;quot;START&amp;quot;. Each player rolls the pair of dice. High number starts and play continues clockwise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is divided into matches. A match is won by the first player to fill a GREEN square. The chips are moved from START to the GREEN area in their lane according to the roll of the dice. One chip can be moved the total of the dice or each die can be used separately to move two chips. A seven must be split except when chips are in the PURPLE area (see next paragraph). On a roll of doubles the player may move or take the POT if there are any chips in the POT (See RED in next paragraph). To &amp;quot;Ricochet&amp;quot; means to reverse direction while moving one chip. In order to land in the GREEN the count must be exact. If the roll would take the chip beyond the double line, the chip can be reversed at the double line. The winner of a match takes all the chips in play from all players except those chips on START or GREEN. The game is over when one player has filled all five of his GREEN squares. The game winner takes all the chips in play except those on START. The ultimate winner is the player with the most chips.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each section contains areas of colored squares. A chip cannot remain in the RED area. It must be put in the POT. The WHITE area is safe. Chips may remain in WHITE and be moved when the player wishes. A chip in the BLUE area is safe until another player places a chip in the BLUE. The first player must then surrender his chip to that player. A chip in the PURPLE area must move before a chip in the WHITE, BLUE or START. If there is more than one chip in the PURPLE, the one nearest the GREEN must move first. Chips in PURPLE must use the total on the dice to move one chip. A chip in the ORANGE area is lost and remains frozen until the match is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
